	abstract = {{Secure determination of the binding of 99mTc-radiopharmaceuticals to
plasma (P) and blood cell (BC) constituents can help to understand the
biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals. The reported precipitation
studies of blood with radiopharmaceuticals have shown that the results
can not be easily compared between studies. We decided to determine the
``gold standard{''} concentration of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to
evaluate the binding to blood elements for several radiopharmaceuticals
used in routine nuclear medicine. We have studied phytic (99mTc-PHY),
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (99mTc-DTPA), glucoheptonic (99mTc-GHA)
and dimercaptosuccinic (99mTc-DMSA) acids. Blood was incubated with
radiopharmaceuticals, centrifuged and P and BC separated. Samples of P
and BC were also precipitated with TCA concentrations (20.0, 10.0, 5.0,
1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 percent) and soluble (SF) and insoluble fractions (IF)
were isolated. The percent radioactivity (percent rad) in IF-P depends
on TCA concentration. It varied from 36.4 to 65.0 (99mTc-PHY), from 17.9
to 32.0 (99mTc-DTPA), from 11.5 to 38.8 (99mTc-GHA) and from 52.8 to
66.2 (99mTc-DMSA). The results for the binding of 99mTc-PHY to IF-P show
that there was no differences in the percent rad when TCA concentrations
of 0.1 to 1.0 percent were used. For 99mTc-DTPA, 5.0 percent is the best
TCA concentration. For 99mTc-GHA, low values of percent rad bound to
IF-P is found with TCA concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0.
Interestingly, with 99mTc-DMSA, high values of bound radioactivity are
not dependent on TCA concentrations (0.1 to 10.0). Radioactivity in
IF-BC depends on TCA concentration and it varied for 99mTc-PHY (80.1 to
54.1) and for 99mTc-GHA (85.5 to 61.7). With 99mTc-DTPA and with
99mTc-DMSA the percent rad in IF-BC seems independent of TCA
concentration. We suggest that the evaluation of the binding of the
various 99mTc-radiopharmaceuticals to blood constituents, using only one
TCA concentration, should be avoided.}},

	abstract = {{Chloroform (TCM), a water disinfection by-product, induced liver tumors
in female mice when administered by gavage in corn oil but not when
given in drinking water at comparable daily doses. Because short-term
studies showed that the gavage doses also induced liver toxicity, it has
been suggested that the liver tumor response occurs secondary to
cytotoxicity and consequent regenerative hyperplasia induced by
oxidative metabolism of TCM to the toxic dihalocarbonyl intermediate.
This study compares dose-response relationships of gavage-administered
chlorinated/ brominated trihalomethanes for hepatotoxicity, replicative
DNA synthesis, and hepatocarcinogenicity in female B6C3F(1) mice. The
liver tumor data were obtained from previously published studies.
Because bromine is a better leaving group than chlorine, metabolism of
bromodichloromethane (BDCM) should produce the same intermediates as
would be formed from TCM. Hence, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of
BDCM was expected to be qualitatively similar to that of TCM. Dose
responses for liver weight, serum sorbitol dehydrogenase and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) activities, hepatocyte degeneration, and
hepatocyte labeling index (LI, a measure of replicative DNA synthesis)
in female mice were similar following 3 weeks of gavage administration
(once per day, 5 days per week) with TCM, BDCM, or chlorodibromomethane
(CDBM). Fits of composite data for these trihalomethanes to a Hill
equation model revealed sigmoidal dose responses for ALT activity and
hepatocyte LI and a nearly linear low-dose response for liver tumor
incidence. For this family of chemicals, the mouse liver tumor response
was not associated with an elevated hepatocyte LI at doses of
approximately 1 mmol/kg or less. High incidences of liver tumors were
observed,vith BDCM and CDBM at doses that had a marginal effect or no
effect on the hepatocyte LI. Thus, the carcinogenic effects of
trihalomethanes are not simply a consequence of cytotoxicity and
regenerative hyperplasia. The possible contributions from other
activation pathways, including GSH conjugation and reductive metabolism,
need to be considered in assessments of the carcinogenicity of the
trihalomethanes.}},

	abstract = {{In this article, exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) in indoor swimming
pools as a consequence of water chlorination is reported. Environmental
and biological monitoring of THMs was performed in order to assess the
uptake of these substances after a defined period in five competitive
swimmers, regularly attending an indoor swimming pool to train for
competition during four sampling sessions. Analyses were performed by
gas-chromatography and the following THMs were detected: chloroform
(CHCl3), bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2), dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl)
and bromoform (CHBr3). CHCl3 appeared the most represented compound both
in water and in environmental air before and after swimming. CHBrCl2 and
CHBr2Cl were always present, even though at lower levels than CHCl3,
CHBr3 was rarely present. In relation to biological monitoring, CHCl3,
CHBrCl2 and CHBr2Cl were detected in all alveolar air samples collected
inside the swimming pool. Before swimming, after 1 h at rest at the pool
edge, the mean values were 29.4 +/- 13.3, 2.7 +/- 1.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.8 mu
g/m(3), respectively, while after spending Ih swimming, higher levels
were detected (76.5 +/- 18.6, 6.5 +/- 1.3 and 1.4 +/- 0.9 mu g/m(3),
respectively). Only CHCl3 was detected in all plasma samples (mean: 1.4
+/- 0.5 mu g/l) while CHBrCl2 and CHBr2Cl were observed only in few
samples at a detection limit of 0.1 mu g/l. After 1 h at rest, at an
average environmental exposure of approx. 100 mu g/m(3), the THM uptake
was approx, 30 mu g/h (26 mu g/h for CHCl3, 3 mu g/h for CHBrCl2 and 1.5
mu g/h for CHBr2Cl). After 1 h swimming, the THM uptake is approx, seven
times higher than at rest: a THM mean uptake of 221 mu g/h (177 mu g/h,
26 mu g/h and 18 mu g/h for CHCl3, CHBrCl2 and CHBr2Cl, respectively)
was evaluated at an environmental concentration of approx. 200 mu

	abstract = {{We have developed and applied a new measurement methodology to
investigate dermal absorption of chloroform while bathing. Ten subjects
bathed in chlorinated water while breathing pure air through a face
mask. Their exhaled breath was delivered to a glow discharge source/ion
trap mass spectrometer for continuous real-time measurement of
chloroform in the breath. This new method provides abundant data
compared to previous discrete time-integrated breath sampling methods.
The method is particularly well suited to studying dermal exposure
because the full face mask eliminates exposure to contaminated air.
Seven of the 10 subjects bathed in water at two or three different
temperatures between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Subjects at the
highest temperatures exhaled about 30 times more chloroform than the
same subjects at the lowest temperatures. This probably results from a
decline in blood Bow to the skin at the lower temperatures as the body
seeks to conserve heat forcing the chloroform to diffuse over a much
greater path length before encountering the blood. These results suggest
that pharmacokinetic models need to employ temperature-dependent
parameters. Two existing models predict quite different times of about
12 min and 29 min for chloroform flux through the stratum corneum to
reach equilibrium. At 40 degrees C, the time for the flux to reach a
near steady-state value is 6-9 min. Although uptake and decay processes
involve several body compartments, the complicating effect of the
stratum corneum lag time made it difficult to fit multiexponential
curves to the data; however, a single-compartment model gave a
satisfactory fit.}},

	abstract = {{The toxic interaction between carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and chloroform
(CHCl3) was investigated in rats chronically pretreated with ethanol,
and in rat liver microsomes. A combined exposure to 10 ppm CCl4 and 50
ppm CHCl3 increased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity to a
level similar to that by a single exposure to 50 ppm CCl4. The single
exposure decreased liver reduced glutathione (GSH) and cytochrome P450
(CYP) content, and N-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase (NDMAD)
activity. The effects of combined exposure, however, were little or less
than those of the single exposure. Immunoblot analysis with monoclonal
antibody to CYP2E1 indicated that CYP2E1 was appreciably decreased after
the single exposure but the enzyme remained after the combined exposure.
The antibody inhibited CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation in microsomes
from ethanol-treated rats. Ethanol pretreatment increased the metabolic
rate of CCl4 and CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation, but the coexistence of
CHCl3 and other hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene and
1,1,1-trichloroethane did not increase the in vitro metabolic rate or
the lipid peroxidation. The addition of GSH decreased CCl4-induced lipid
peroxidation, and the effect reached its maximum at 0.3 mM of GSH, so
that the hepatotoxic interaction between CCl4 and CHCl3 at low dose
exposure is more than additive when judged by the plasma ALT activity,
but this is not true of the changes in drug-metabolizing enzyme activity
and GSH depletion.}},

	abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the present study was to develop valid methods for
monitoring of occupational exposure to dichloromethane (DCM). Methods:
Carbon cloth as an adsorbent in diffusive sampling was tested for its
capacity to adsorb DCM vapor and to retain adsorbed DCM after
termination of the exposure. Urine samples collected from DCM-exposed
workers were analyzed for DCM by the head-space technique. After
extraction with carbon disulfide, DCM in the cloth was analyzed on a
DB-WAX capillary column by flame-ionization detection gas chromatography
(FID-GC) and DCM in urine was analyzed by electron-capture detection
(ECD)-GC. Results: The diffusive sampling with carbon cloth as an
adsorbent is applicable to 4-h monitoring of exposure to up to 100 ppm
DCM vapor. DCM concentrations detected in end-of-shift urine samples
correlated linearly with time-weighted average DCM concentrations
measured in the breathing-zone air of the exposed workers; essentially
the same exposure-excretion relationship was obtained by vapor
monitoring for the afternoon 4-h period as compared with a whole day
(8-h) of vapor monitoring. There was no sex difference in the
exposure-excretion relation. Conclusions: Both personal diffusive
sampling (at up to 100 ppm DCM and for up to 4 h) and biological
exposure monitoring by urinalysis for DCM are applicable in occupational
health as reliable measures of exposure to this chlorinated hydrocarbon
solvent.}},

@article{ISI:000076994700007,
	abstract = {{Nine male and eight female healthy volunteers were exposed to 50 or 100
ppm trichloroethylene vapors for 4 h. Blood, urine, and exhaled breath
samples were collected for development of a physiologically based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for trichloroethylene and its two major
P450-mediated metabolites, trichloroacetic acid and free
trichloroethanol. Blood and urine were analyzed for trichloroethylene,
chloral hydrate, free trichloroethanol and trichloroethanol glucuronide,
and trichloroacetic acid. Plasma was analyzed for dichloroacetic acid.
Trichloroethylene was also measured in exhaled breath samples.
Trichloroethylene, free trichloroethanol, and trichloroacetic acid were
found in blood samples of all volunteers and only trace amounts of
dichloroacetic acid (4-12 ppb) were found in plasma samples from a few
volunteers. Trichloroethanol glucuronide and trichloroacetic acid were
found in urine of all volunteers. No chloral hydrate was detected in the
volunteers. Gender-specific PBPK models were developed with fitted
urinary rate constant values for each individual trichloroethytene
exposure to describe urinary excretion of trichloroethanol glucuronide
and trichloroacetic acid. Individual urinary excretion rate constants
were necessary to account for the variability in the measured cumulative
amount of metabolites excreted in the urine. However, the average amount
of trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol glucuronide excreted in
urine for each gender was predicted using mean urinary excretion rate
constant values for each sex. A four-compartment physiological how model
was used for the metabolites (lung, liver, kidney, and body) and a
six-compartment physiological flow model was used for trichloroethylene
(lung, liver, kidney, fat, and slowly and rapidly perfused tissues).
Metabolic capacity (V-maxc) for oxidation of trichloroethylene was
estimated to be 4 mg/kg/h in males and 5 mg/kg/h in females. Metabolized
trichloroethylene was assumed to be converted to either free
trichloroethanol (90\%) or trichloroacetic acid (10\%). Free
trichloroethanol was glucuronidated forming trichloroethanol glucuronide
or converted to trichloroacetic acid via back conversion of
trichloroethanol to chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde). Trichloroethanol
glucuronide and trichloroacetic acid were then excreted in urine.
Gender-related pharmacokinetic differences in the uptake and metabolism
of trichloroethylene were minor, but apparent. In general, the PBPK
models for the male and female volunteers provided adequate predictions
of the uptake of trichloroethytene and distribution of trichloroethylene
and its metabolites, trichloroacetic acid and free trichloroethanol. The
PBPK models for males and females consistently overpredicted exhaled
breath concentrations of trichloroethylene immediately following the TCE
exposure for a 2- to 4-h period, Further research is needed to better
understand the biological determinants responsible for the observed
variability in urinary excretion of trichloroethanol glucuronide and
trichloroacetic acid and the metabolic pathway resulting in formation of
dichloroacetic acid.}},

@article{ISI:000077581900003,
	abstract = {{Chronic exposure of rodents to perchloroethene (PER) increased the
incidence of liver tumors in male mice and resulted in a small but
significant increase in the incidence of renal tumors in male rats. The
tumorigenicity of PER is mediated by metabolic activation reactions. PER
is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and by conjugation viith glutathione.
Cytochrome P450 oxidation of PER results in trichloroacetyl chloride
which reacts with water to trichloroacetic acid (TCA) which is excreted.
The formation of S-(trichlorovinyl)glutathione (TCVG) from PER results
in nephrotoxic metabolites. TCVG is cleaved to
S-(trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (TCVC) and acetylated to
N-acetyl-S-(trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (N-ac-TCVC), which is excreted
with urine. TCVC is also cleaved in the kidney by cysteine conjugate
beta-lyase to dichlorothioketene which may react with water to
dichloroacetic acid (DCA) or with cellular macromolecules. The object of
this study was to comparatively quantify the dose-dependent excretion of
PER metabolites in urine of humans and rats after inhalation exposure.
Three female and three male human volunteers and three female and three
male rats were exposed to 10, 20, and 40 ppm PER for 6 h, and three
female and three male rats to 400 ppm. A dose-dependent increase in the
excretion of TCA and N-ac-TCVC after exposure to PER was found both in
humans and in rats. A total of 20.4 +/- 7.77 mu mol of TCA and 0.21 +/-
0.05 mu mol of N-ac-TCVC were excreted in urine of humans over 78 h
after the start of exposure to 40 ppm PER; only traces of DCA were
present. After identical exposure conditions, rats excreted 1.64 +/-
0.42 mu mol of TCA, 0.006 +/- 0.002 mu mol of N-ac-TCVC and 0.18 +/-
0.04 mu mol of DCA. Excretion of N-ac-TCVC in male rats exposed to 400
ppm PER (103.7 nmol) was significantly higher, compared to female rats
(31.5 nmol) exposed under identical conditions. N-ac-TCVC was rapidly
eliminated with urine both in humans (t(1/2) = 14.1 h) and in rats
(t(1/2) = 7.5 h), When comparing the urinary excretion of N-ac-TCVC, a
potential marker for the formation of reactive intermediates in the
kidney, humans received a significantly lower dose (3 nmol/kg at 40 ppm)
compared to rats (23.0 nmol/kg) after identical exposure conditions. In
addition, rats excreted large amounts of DCA which likely is a product
of the beta-lyase-dependent metabolism of TCVC in the kidney, The
obtained data suggest that glutathione conjugate formation and
beta-lyase-dependent bioactivation of TCVC in PER metabolism is
significantly higher in rats than in humans. Thus, using rat
tumorigenicity data for human risk assessment of PER exposure may
overestimate human tumor risks. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

	abstract = {{Exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) of drinking water is
multiroute and occurs in households serviced by municipal water
treatment facilities that disinfect the water as a necessary step to hat
the spread of waterborne infectious diseases. Biomarkers of the Mo most
abundant groups of DBPs of chlorination, exhaled breath levels of
trihalomethanes (THMs) and urinary levels of two haloacetic acids, were
compared to exposure estimates calculated from in-home tap water
concentrations and responses to a questionnaire related to water usage.
Background THM breath concentrations were uniformly low. Strong
relationships were identified between the THM breath concentrations
collected after a shower and both the THM water concentration and the
THM exposure from a shower, after adjusting for the postshower delay
time in collecting the breath sample. Urinary haloacetic acid excretion
rates were not correlated to water concentrations. Urinary
trichloroacetic acid excretion rates were correlated with ingestion
exposure, and that correlation was stronger in a subset of individuals
who consumed beverages primarily within their home where the
concentration measurements were made. No correlation was observed
between an average 48-hr exposure estimate and the urinary
dichloroacetic acid excretion rate, presumably because of its short
biological half-life. Valid biomarkers were identified for DBP
exposures, but the time between the exposure and sample collection
should be considered to account for different metabolic rates among the
DBPs. Further, using water concentration as an exposure estimate can
introduce misclassification of exposure for DBPs whose primary route is
ingestion due to the great variability in the amount of water ingested
across a population.}},

	abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine if DCAA and TCAA urinary excretion
rates are valid biomarkers of chronic ingestion exposure to these
disinfection by-products of chlorination of drinking water. Entire first
morning urine voids, time-of-visit urine samples, and tap water samples
were collected from 47 female subjects. In addition, a 48-h recall
questionnaire was administered to determine the amounts and types of
liquids ingested by each subject as well as other exposures that could
lead to DCAA and TCAA urinary excretion. The TCAA excretion rate for the
first morning urine samples was significantly correlated with the
estimated 48-h TCAA ingestion exposure for 25 subjects whose ingestion
exposures primarily occurred at home, while the DCAA excretion rate was
not correlated with the DCAA ingestion exposure. Thus, urinary TCAA
appears to be a valid biomarker of chronic ingestion exposure to TCAA
from chlorinated water, while urinary DCAA is not. It is proposed that
the difference in the biological half-lives between these two compounds
is the rationale for this finding. The biological half-life of TCAA is
longer than successive exposure intervals; thus TCAA accumulates until
it reaches a steady state, The half-life of DCAA is shorter than
successive exposure intervals; thus DCAA is almost completely
metabolized following an exposure and is eliminated from the body. This
study suggests that biological half-life, exposure interval, and sample
collection interval should be considered in selecting biomarkers and
designing studies to validate them. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

	abstract = {{Trihalomethanes (THMs; chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane,
dibromochloromethane), formed as by-products of chlorine disinfection,
are found to occur in combination in drinking water supplies. THMs are
metabolized by cytochromes P-450 and are likely substrates of CYP2E1.
Therefore, it is possible that mixed exposure results in toxicokinetic
interactions among THMs. The toxicokinetics of THMs during mixed
exposures has not been investigated previously. The purpose of this
study was to characterize the blood kinetics of the four THMs
administered singly or in combination in the rat. A single dose of 0.25
mmol/kg or 0.5 mmol/kg b.w., of each THM alone, or of a quaternary
mixture containing 0.25 mmol/kg of each THM (total dose of 1.0 mmoI/kg)
was administered by gavage. The Venous blood concentrations of the THMs
were measured by headspace gas chromatography (GC) at 20, 40, 60, 120,
180, 270 and 360 min post-administration. Results showed a nonlinear
relationship between the area under the blood concentration versus time
curves (AUCs) and administered doses of THMs, suggesting that metabolism
is saturated in this dose range. The venous blood concentrations of THMs
following administration of the quaternary mixture were significantly
higher compared to single exposures. The altered kinetics of THMs during
combined exposures is consistent with the occurrence of mutual
inhibition of their hepatic metabolism. Simulation exercises conducted
with physiologically based toxicokinetic models support metabolic
inhibition as the possible mechanism of the interaction among THMs. The
data reported in this study provide the starting point for evaluating
the significance of interactions among THMs in the risk assessment
process. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is a contaminant found in treated drinking
water due to chlorination. DCA has been shown to be a complete
hepatocarcinogen in both mice and rats. In this study we developed a
rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method
to simultaneously detect DCA and its metabolites, oxalic acid, glyoxylic
acid and glycolic acid in blood and urine samples of animals
sub-chronically administered with DCA (2 g/l) in drinking water. Both
urine and plasma samples were treated minimally before HPLC analysis.
Separation and detection of DCA and its metabolites were achieved using
an anion-exchange column and a conductivity detector. The mobile phase
consisted of an initial concentration of 0.01 mM sodium hydroxide in
40\% methanol followed by a linear gradient from 0.01 mM to 60 mM sodium
hydroxide in 40\% methanol for 30 min. The lower detection limit for DCA
and each of its three major metabolites was 0.05 mu g/ml. DCA and its
metabolites gave a linear response range from 0.05 to 100 mu g/ml.
Plasma DCA was also analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), and the results
obtained correlated with those from the HPLC method (correlation
coefficient=0.999). While available HPLC techniques offer sensitive
procedures to detect either glycolic acid or oxalic acid, the described
HPLC method has the unique advantage of determining simultaneously the
parent compound (DCA) and its three major metabolites (oxalic acid,
glyoxylic acid and glycolic acid) in biological samples, without complex
sample preparation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{Blood concentrations of chloroform were monitored after exposing small
areas ( approximate to 5.5 cm(2)) of the backs of hairless rats to
liberal excesses of the solvent for either 1, 3, or 8 min. The amounts
absorbed were quantified by comparing areas-under-the-curves (AUCs) of
blood concentration versus time plots to the AUC obtained on infusing an
aqueous chloroform solution of known concentration for 30 min (positive
control). Chloroform penetrated the dermal barrier rapidly, the skin's
horny layer and the deeper skin tissues acting as reservoirs for
chloroform only for short durations. Evaporative and physiological
clearance from these reservoirs was rapid once the chloroform was
removed from the surface. Pressure of the template used to confine the
exposure affected uptake. For blood levels, the time to reach the
maximum blood concentration increased with increased exposure duration.
Amounts absorbed also depended on exposure duration, Blood level
profiles indicated systemic uptake of chloroform following a 3-min
exposure was about 1.3-fold higher than for a 1-min exposure (not
significant), while the 8-min exposure produced an AUC roughly 3.8-fold
higher than found at 3 min (p = 0.026). Chloroform is rapidly cleared
from rat blood (terminal elimination rate constant = 0.009/min).
Calculations indicated that its absorption from these area-limited
exposures far exceeds that which would be absorbed had the chloroform
been presented to the skin as a saturated aqueous solution.}},

	abstract = {{Chloroacetaldehyde (CA) fs a nephrotoxic and neurotoxic metabolite of
the anticancer drug ifosfamide (IFA) and is a dose-limiting factor in
IFA-based chemotherapy. Plasma levels of CA in IFA-treated cancer
patients are often difficult to determine due to the lack of a
sufficiently sensitive and specific analytical method. We have developed
a simple and sensitive HPLC method with fluorescence detection to
measure CA formation catalyzed by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, either
in vivo in IFA-injected rats or in vitro in liver microsomal
incubations. This method is based on the formation of the highly
fluorescent adduct 1-N-6-ethenoadenosine from the reaction of CA with
adenosine (10 mM) at pH 4.5 upon heating at 80 degrees C for 2 h. The
derivatization mixture is directly injected onto a C18 HPLC column and
is monitored with a fluorescence detector. Calibration curves are linear
(r > 0.999) over a wide range of CA concentrations (5-400 pmol). The
limit of detection of CA in plasma using this method is <0.1 mu M and
only 50 mu l of plasma is required for the assay. By coupling this
method with a recently described HPLC-fluorescent method to determine
acrolein, a cytochrome P450 metabolite of IFA formed during the
activation of the drug by 4-hydroxylation, the two major, alternative
P450-catalyzed pathways of IFA metabolism can be monitored from the same
plasma samples or liver microsomal incubations and the partitioning of
drug between these two pathways thereby quantitated. This assay may
prove to be useful for studies of IFA metabolism aimed at identifying
factors that contribute to individual differences in CA formation and in
developing approaches to minimize CA formation while maximizing IFA
cytotoxicity. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

	abstract = {{The brominated trihalomethanes (THMs) are mutagenic and carcinogenic
disinfection by-products frequently found in chlorinated drinking water.
They can be activated to mutagens by the product of the glutathione
S-transferase-theta (GSTT1-1) gene in Salmonella RSJ100, which has been
transfected with this gene. To evaluate this phenomenon in humans, we
have examined the genotoxicity of a brominated THM, bromoform (BF),
using the Comet assay in human whole blood cultures exposed in vitro. No
differences were found in the comet tail length between cultures from
GSTT1-1(+) versus GSTT1-1(-) individuals (1.67 +/- 0.40 and 0.74 +/-
0.54 mu m/mM, respectively, P = 0.28). The high variability was due to
the relatively weak induction of comets by BF, Combining the data from
both genotypic groups, the genotoxic potency of BF was 1.20 +/- 0.34 mu
m/mM (P = 0.003). GSTT1-1 is expressed in red blood cells but not in the
target cells (lymphocytes), and expression within the target cell las in
Salmonella RSJ100) may be necessary for enhanced mutagenesis in
GSTT1-1(+) relative to GSTT1-1(-) cultures. To examine this, we exposed
Salmonella RSJ100 and a control strain not expressing the gene (TPT100)
to the most mutagenic brominated THM detected in Salmonella,
dibromochloromethane (DBCM), either in the presence or absence of S9 or
red blood cells from GSTT1-1(+) or GSTT1-1(-) individuals. S9 did not
activate DBCM in the non-expressing strain TPT100, and it did not affect
the ability of the expressing strain RSJ100 to activate DBCM, As with
S9, red cells from either genotypic group were unable to activate DBCM
in TPT100, However, red cells (whole or lysed) from both genotypic
groups completely repressed the ability of the expressing strain RSJ100
to activate DBCM to a mutagen. Such results suggest a model in which
exposure to brominated THMs may pose an excess genotoxic risk in
GSTT1-1(+) individuals to those organs and tissues that both express
this gene and come into direct contact with the brominated THM, such as
the colon. In contrast, those organs to which brominated THMs would be
transported via the blood might be protected by erythrocytes, Such a
proposal is reasonably consistent with the organ specificity of drinking
water-associated cancer in humans, which shows slightly elevated risks
for cancer of the colon and bladder but not of the liver.}},

frequently in chlorinated drinking water. Brominated THMs are mutagenic
in a variety of systems and are carcinogenic in rodents. The metabolism
of brominated THMs is thought to involve a GSH conjugation reaction
leading either to formaldehyde or DNA-reactive intermediates via
glutathione S-transferase-theta (GSTTI-1), which is polymorphic in
humans. In the present study, we have determined the genotoxicity of one
of the brominated THMs, bromoform (BF), by measuring its ability to
induce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in whole-blood (WB) cultures of
human peripheral blood lymphocytes from GSTT1-1 + and GSTT1-1 - donors.
The results showed no differences in SCEs per cell by BF between GSTT1-1
+ and GSTT1-1 - individuals when the cells were exposed to 5 X 10(-3) M
BF at the beginning of cell culturing (10.8 +/- 0.85 vs. 10.57 + 0.47,

24th h (8.21 +/- 0.61 vs. 8.29 +/- 0.24) of cell growth. Although
GSTT1-1 is expressed in the erythrocytes, the lack of expression of the

the range of 0.5-8 mu g/ml. The detection limits for both compounds were
0.3 mu g/ml for whole blood, and 0.2 mu g/ml for urine. The headspace

chromatographic method for the determination of thalidomide in serum,
with phenacetin as an internal standard, is described. Protein
precipitation, using trichloroacetic acid, was used for clean-up. The
aliquot was chromatographed on a octadecyl column, using an eluent
composed of 250 ml 0.01 M potassium dihydrogenphosphate, adjusted to a
pH of 3.0 with a 43\% phosphoric acid solution, mixed with 750 ml
methanol. Ultraviolet detection was used at an operation wavelength of
220 nm. Hydrolytic degradation was prevented during analysis by
acidification of samples with the precipitation reagent. Thalidomide and
phenacetin were found to have retention times of 7.9 and 15.0 min,
respectively. Recoveries ranging from 79 to 84\% were found for both
components, with reproducibility relative standard deviations of 0.8-3\%
and repeatability coefficients of 1.2-3\%. A mean correlation
coefficient of 0.9995 was found for the linear calibration curve (n=2)
of thalidomide with Limits of quantitation of 0.222-21 mg/l. The method
appeared to be feasible for pharmacokinetic studies with thalidomide.

	abstract = {{Nonthermal plasma chemical decomposition of bromomethane (CH3Br) was
investigated with a coaxial type packed-bed plasma reactor. It has been
demonstrated that plasma chemical processing is an effective approach to
decompose CH3Br in a wide concentration range. It has been shown that
CH3Br decomposition reactivity depends on reactor operating factors such
as background gas, O-2 concentration, and humidification. Higher
decomposition efficiencies can be obtained in dry N-2. However, organic
byproducts such as BrCN are concurrently produced under deaerated
conditions. Water suppresses CH3Br decomposition and also affects the
yields of COx (CO and CO2) and organic byproducts due to the involvement
of some active species generated from water. The presence of O-2 retards
CH3Br decomposition by quenching high-energy electrons, while it
suppresses organic byproducts and improves COx yield. The reacted
carbons in CH3Br are recovered as COx almost quantitatively in air.
Higher CO2 selectivities cannot be achieved by increasing O-2
concentration. NOx formation, which is accompanied by CH3Br
decomposition, can be effectively suppressed by decreasing O-2
concentration down to 2\%. Furthermore, reaction mechanisms are
discussed by comparing the reactivities of CH3Br and its congeners.}},

	abstract = {{Male B6C3F(1) mice were exposed to dichloroacetic acid (DCA) in the
drinking water in order to establish a dose response for the induction
of hepatocellular cancer and to examine several modes of action for the
carcinogenic process. Groups of animals were exposed to control, 0.05,
0.5, 1, 2, or 3.5 g/L DCA in the drinking water for 90-100 wk. Mean
daily doses (MDD) of 8, 84, 168, 315, and 429 mg/kg/d of DCA were
calculated. The prevalence (percent of animals) with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HC) was significantly increased in the 1-g/L (71\%), 2-g/L
(95\%), and 3.5-g/L (100\%) treatment groups when compared to the
control (26\%). HC multiplicity (tumors/animal) was significantly
increased by all DCA treatments-0.05 g/L (0.58), 0.5 g/L (0.68), 1 g/L
(1.29), 2 g/L (2.47), and 3.5 g/L (2.90)-compared to the control group
(0.28). Based upon HC multiplicity, a no-observed-effect level (NOEL)
for hepatocarcinogenicity could not be determined. Hepatic peroxisome
proliferation was significantly increased only for 3.5 g/L DCA treatment
at 26 wk and did not correlate with the liver tumor response. The
severity of hepatotoxicity increased with DCA concentration. Below I
g/L, hepatotoxicity was mild and transient as demonstrated by the
severity indices and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity. An analysis
of generalized hepatocyte proliferation reflected the mild
hepatotoxicity and demonstrated no significant treatment effects on the
labeling index of hepatocytes outside proliferative lesions.
Consequently, the induction of liver cancer by DCA does not appear to be
conditional upon peroxisome induction or chemically sustained cell
proliferation. Hepatotoxicity, especially at the higher doses, may exert
an important influence on the carcinogenic process.}},

equal to 5\% and accuracies between 95 and 117\% were found, using a
0.2-ml volume of plasma. The lower limit of quantification is 10 ng/ml

	abstract = {{The kinetics of chloroform in the exhaled breath of human volunteers
exposed skin-only via bath water (concentrations < 100 ppb) were
analyzed using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.
Significant increases in exhaled chloroform (and thus bioavailability)
were observed as exposure temperatures were increased from 30 to 40
degrees C, The blood flows to the skin and effective skin permeability
coefficients (Kp) were both varied to reflect the temperature-dependent
changes in physiology and exhalation kinetics. At 40 degrees C, no
differences were observed between males and females. Therefore, Kps were
determined (similar to 0.06 cm/hr) at a skin blood how rate of 18\% of
the cardiac output. At 30 and 35 degrees C, males exhaled more
chloroform than females, resulting in lower effective Kps calculated for
females. At these lower temperatures, the blood flow to the skin was
also reduced. Total amounts of chloroform absorbed averaged 41.9 and
43.6 mu g for males and 11.5 and 39.9 mu g for females exposed at 35 and
40 degrees C, respectively. At 30 degrees C, only 2/5 males and 1/5
females had detectable concentrations of chloroform in their exhaled
breath. For perspective, the total intake of chloroform would have
ranged from 79-194 mu g if the volunteers had consumed 2 liters of water
orally at the concentrations used in this study. Thus, the relative
contribution of dermal uptake of chloroform to the total body burdens
associated with bathing for 30 min and drinking 2 liters of water
(ignoring contributions from inhalation exposures) was predicted to
range from 1 to 28\%, depending on the temperature of the bath.}},

	abstract = {{Objective: The present study was initiated to examine a quantitative
relationship between tetrachloroethene (TETRA) in blood and urine with
TETRA in air, and to compare TETRA in blood or urine with
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in urine as exposure markers. Methods: In
total, 44 workers (exposed to TETRA during automated, continuous
cloth-degreasing operations), and ten non-exposed subjects volunteered
to participate in the study. The exposure to vapor was monitored by
diffusive sampling. The amounts of TETRA and TCA in end-of-shift blood
and urine samples were measured by either head-space gas chromatography
(HS-GC) or automated methylation followed by HS-GC. The correlation was
examined by regression analysis. Results: The maximum time-weighted
average (TWA) concentration for TETRA-exposure was 46 ppm. Regression
analysis for correlation of TETRA in blood, TETRA in urine and TCA in
urine, with TETRA in air, showed that the coefficient was largest for
the correlation between TETRA in air and TETRA in blood. The TETRA in
blood, in urine and in air correlated mutually, whereas TCA in urine
correlated more closely with TETRA in blood than with TETRA in urine.
The TCA values determined by colorimetry and by the GC method were very
similar. The biological marker levels at a hypothetical exposure of 25
ppm TETRA were substantially higher in the present study than were the
levels reported in the literature. Possible reasons are discussed.
Conclusions: Blood TETRA is the best marker of occupational exposure to
TETRA, being superior to the traditional marker, urinary TCA.}},

	abstract = {{The destruction of dichloromethane by a nonthermal plasma in
atmospheric-pressure gas streams of nitrogen with variable amounts of
added oxygen has been investigated. The identities and concentrations of
the end products are determined by on-line FTIR spectroscopy, and the
plasma chemistry is interpreted using a kinetic modeling scheme. Peak
destructions of 20\% are found for a deposited energy of 66 J L-1. The
maximum dissociation is found for a carrier gas that contains 1-3\% O-2,
and the dissociation is greater in pure nitrogen than in an air stream.
The major end products of the processing are HCN, Cl-2 and HCl in pure
nitrogen and CO, COCl2, HCl, and Cl-2 for gas streams containing oxygen.
The plasma processing in streams containing oxygen also produces
significant yields of nitrogen oxides. The mechanism of dichloromethane
destruction in the plasma is predominantly oxidation initiated by atomic
chlorine that is produced by collisions of dichloromethane with
electronically excited nitrogen atoms and molecules. Because of low
cross sections, electron attachment does not play a role in the
destruction of dichloromethane. The addition of oxygen to the gas
streams initially causes additional destruction from O and OI-I
reactions, but further increase in the oxygen concentration causes
inhibition of both the atomic chlorine cycle and the formation of NOx
and a consequent reduction in dichloromethane destruction.}},

	abstract = {{Human consumption of chlorinated drinking water has been linked
epidemiologically to bladder, kidney, and rectal cancers. The
disinfection by-product (DBP) dichloroacetic acid is a hepatocarcinogen
in Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. The objective of this study is to
determine the effect of the DBPs dichlorobromochloro-, and dibromoacetic
acids (DCA, BCA, DBA) on intestinal microbial populations and their
metabolism, with emphasis on enzymes involved in the bioactivation of
procarcinogens and promutagens. One-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were
provided water ad libitum containing 1 gn DCA, BCA, or DBA for up to 5
weeks. At 1, 3, and 5 weeks of treatment, beta-glucuronidase (GLR),
beta-galactosidase (GAL), beta-glucosidase (GLU), nitroreductase (NR),
azoreductase (AR), and dechlorinase (DC) activities were determined in
cecal and small and large intestinal homogenates. After 5 weeks of
treatment, intestinal populations were enumerated on selective media.
Cecal GAL (DCA, BCA, DBA) and GLR (DCA, DBA) activities were reduced
after 1 and 3 weeks of treatment and GAL activity was elevated at 5
weeks (BCA). Large intestinal GAL (DCA, BCA) and GLU (DCA, BCA, DBA)
activities were elevated after 5 weeks of treatment. Week 5 cecal AR
(DCA, BCA, DBA), NR (DCA), and DC (DCA, DBA) activities were reduced.
Even though some significant changes in intestinal populations were
observed, use of selective media was not sensitive enough to explain
fluctuations in enzyme activity. Haloacetic acids in the drinking water
alter intestinal metabolism, which could influence bioactivation of
promutagens and procarcinogens in the drinking water.}},

	abstract = {{Exposure to drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs), such as
trihalomethanes (THMs), has been associated with bladder and colorectal
cancer in humans. Exposure to DBPs has typically been determined by
examining historical water treatment records and reconstructing study
participants' water consumption histories. However, other exposure
routes, such as dermal absorption and inhalation, may be important
components of an individual's total exposure to drinking water DBPs. In
this study, we examined individuals' exposure to THMs through drinking,
showering, or bathing in tap water. Thirty-one adult volunteers showered
with tap water for 10 min ( n = 11), bathed for 10 min in a bathtub
filled with tap water ( n = 10), or drank 11 of tap water during a
10-min time period (n = 10). Participants provided three 10 mi blood
samples: one sample immediately before the exposure; one sample 10 min
after the exposure ended; and one sample 30 min ( for shower and tub
exposure) or 1 h ( for ingestion) after the exposure ended. A sample of
the water ( from the tap, from the bath, or from the shower) was
collected for each participant. We analyzed water samples and whole
blood for THMs (bromoform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane,
and chloroform) using a purge-and-trap/gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry method with detection limits in the parts-perquadrillion
range. The highest levels of THMs were found in the blood samples from
people who took 10-min showers, whereas the lowest levels were found in
the blood samples from people who drank 11 of water in 10 min. The
results from this study indicate that household activities such as
bathing and showering are important routes for human exposure to THMs.}},

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for both clinical and research

amplification by PCR. One was a conventional phenol-chloroform method
and the other used a standardized, manufactured kit. The efficiency of
extraction was tested by semi-quantitative amplification of hepatitis C
viral and GB virus-C/hepatitis G viral RNAs. The standarized commercial
method, although more time efficient, resulted in an approximately ten
fold less sensitivity. Thus, in situations where maximum sensitivity is
needed, the more labor intenstive phenol choloroform method is
recommended. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{We have reviewed the relevant issues in the exposure assessment of
disinfection by-products (DBPs) of chlorination for epidemiological and
hearth risk assessment various DBPs can be detected in drinking water
and swimming pools, and the reported levels show a considerable range,
but were generally below the current health standard for total
trihalomethanes (TTHMs) (100 mug/l). Relatively little information is
available on the correlation between the various DBPs in drinking water
and in swimming pools. Chloroform was generally but not always, the most
predominant DBP. In epidemiological studies, TTHM levels have been used
as an indicator for total DBP load, even though TTHM levels do not
always correlate well with individual DPBs. Factors such as residence
time, temperature, pH, organic content, including humic and fulvic acid
and bromide levels affect the composition and levels of DBPs. Although
there are biomarkers of DBPs. mainly for chloroform and more recently
for the other volatile trihalomethanes (THMs) rind the nonvolatile
haloacetic acids (HAAs) such as trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) and
dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), they have not been used in epidemiological
studies. The THMs have been measured in exhaled breath and serum, while
the HAAs have been measured in urine. These biomarkers have been useful
to estimate the actual uptake of the DBPs and the relative contribution
of various exposure routes. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
models exist for, e.g. chloroform, but their main target organs are the
kidney and liver and they have not been used in epidemiological studies.
Tap water ingestion, showering, bathing, swimming, boiling water and
dishwashing are all activities that have been associated with the uptake
of DBPs, and considerable variation in these activities has been
observed between people. No studies have reported on the correlation
between human uptake of DBPs and water-zone mean estimates, but various
studies found a good correlation between THM concentrations in exhaled
breath and THM concentrations in water during showering and swimming. In
general exposure assessment in epidemiological studies has been limited
which complicates the interpretation. These findings have implications
for epidemiological studies, particularly with reference to Berkson and
classical error type models, study power, attenuation and precision of
health-risk estimates and study efficiency. Recommendations are made for
further areas of study.}},

	abstract = {{The study evaluated occupational exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) in
indoor swimming pools. Thirty-two subjects, representing the whole
workforce employed in the five public indoor swimming pools in the city
of Modena (Northern Italy) were enrolled. Both environmental and
biological monitoring of THMs exposure were performed. Environmental
concentrations of THMs in different areas inside the swimming pools (at
the poolside, in the reception area and in the engine-room) were
measured as external exposure index, while individual exposure of
swimming pool employees was estimated by THMs concentration in alveolar
air. The levels of THMs observed in swimming pool water ranged from 17.8
to 70.8 mug/l; the mean levels of THMs in ambient air were 25.6 +/- 24.5
mug/m(3) in the engine room, 26.1 +/- 24.3 mug/m(3) in the reception
area and 58.0 +/- 22.1 mug/m(3) at the poolside. Among THMs, only
chloroform and bromodichloromethane were always measured in ambient air,
while dibromochloromethane was detected in ambient air rarely and
bromoform only once. Biological monitoring results showed a THMs mean
value of 20.9 +/- 15.6 mug/m(3). Statistically significant differences
were observed according to the main job activity: in pool attendants,
THMs alveolar air were approximately double those observed in employees
working in other areas of the swimming pools (25.1 +/- 16.5 mug/m(3) vs.
14.8 +/- 12.3 mug/m(3), P < 0.01), THMs in alveolar air samples were
significantly correlated with THMs concentrations in ambient air (r =
0,57, P < 0.001). Indoor swimming pool employees are exposed to THMs at
ambient air levels higher than the general population. The different
environmental exposure inside the swimming pool can induce a different
internal dose in exposed workers. The correlation found between ambient
and alveolar air samples confirms that breath analysis is a good
biological index of occupational exposure to these substances at low
environmental levels, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

@article{ISI:000166638300004,
	abstract = {{Dichloromethane (methylene chloride, DCM) is metabolized via two
pathways in humans: mixed-function oxidases (MFO) and
glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Most likely, the carcinogenicity for
DCM is related to metabolic activation of DCM via the GST pathway.
However, as the two pathways are competing, the metabolic capacity for
the MFO pathway in vivo is also of interest in risk assessment for DCM.
Past estimates of MFO metabolism are based on the in vitro activity of
tissue samples. The aim of the present study was to develop a population
model for DCM in order to gain more knowledge on the variability of DCM
inhalation toxicokinetics in humans, with main emphasis on the MFO
metabolic pathway. This was done by merging published in vitro data on
DCM metabolism and partitioning with inhalation toxicokinetic data
(Astrand ef at, 1975, Scand. J. Work.Environ. Health 1, 78-94) from five
human volunteers, using the MCMC technique within a population PBPK
model. Our results indicate that the metabolic capacity for the MFO
pathway in humans is slightly larger than previously estimated from four
human liver samples. Furthermore, the interindividual variability of the
MFO pathway in vivo is smaller among our five subjects than indicated by
the in vitro samples. We also derive a Bayesian estimate of the
population distribution of the MFO metabolism (median maximum metabolic
rate 28, 95\% confidence interval 12-66 mu mol/min) that is a compromise
between the information from the in vitro data and the toxicokinetic
information present in the experimental data.}},

@article{ISI:000167204000005,
	abstract = {{The dose and time dependence of formation of a specific adduct between
mitochondrial phospholipid and phosgene have been determined in the
liver of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats as well as in the liver and kidney of
B6C3F1 mice after dosing with chloroform. Rats were induced with
phenobarbital or non-induced. Determination of tissue glutathione (GSH)
and of serum markers of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity was also
carried out. With dose-dependence experiments, a strong correlation
between the formation of the specific phospholipid adduct, GSH depletion
and organ toxicity could be evidenced in all the organs studied. With
non-induced SD rats, no such effects could be induced up to a dose of
740 mg/kg. Time-course studies with B6C3F1 mice indicated that the
specific adduct formation took place at very early times after
chloroform dosing and was concurrent with GSH depletion. The adduct
formed during even transient GSH depletion (residual level: 30\% of
control) and persisted after restoration of GSH levers. Following a
chloroform dose at the hepatotoxicity threshold (150 mg/kg), the
elimination of the adduct in the liver occurred within 24 h and
correlated with the recovery of ALT, which was slightly increased (12
times) after treatment. Following a moderately nephrotoxic dose (60
mg/kg), the renal adduct persisted longer than 48 h, when a 100\%
increase in blood urea nitrogen and a 40\% increase in serum creatinine
indicated the onset of organ damage. The formation of the adduct in the
liver mitochondria of B6C3F1 mice was associated with the decrease of
phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), in line with previous results in rat
liver indicating that the adduct results from the reaction of phosgene
with PE. The adduct levels implicated the reaction of phosgene with
about 50\% PE molecules in the liver mitochondrial membrane of
phenobarbital-induced SD rats and of about 10\% PE molecules of the
inner mitochondrial membrane of the liver of B6C3F1 mice. The

	abstract = {{Background Since 1947 the National Labour Inspection Service in Denmark
has relied upon urinary measurements of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in
surveys of the occupational exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE).
Methods We examined the paper files relating to 2397 TCA measurements to
extract information about the year the company, the work process and the
worker We used multiple regression models to analyze the effects of
various factors on the urinary concentration of TCA.
Results The regression analyses showed that (I) a four-fold decrease in
TCA concentrations occurred from 1947 to 1985; (2) the highest
concentrations were observed in the iron and metal, chemical, and dry
cleaning industries; (3) TCA levels were two times higher among men
compared with women in the iron and metal and dry cleaning industries;
(4) TCA concentrations were higher among younger compared with older
workers; and (5) persons working in an area in which TCE was used, but
not working with TCE themselves, also showed urinary TCA levels
indicative of exposure.
Conclusion Calendar year; type of industry, degree of contact with TCE,
sex and age were predictors of TCA concentration in the urine of Danish
workers. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

	abstract = {{S-(1-Acetoxymethyl)glutathione (GSCH(2)OAc) was synthesized and used as
a model for the reaction of glutathione (GSH)-dihaloalkane conjugates
with nucleosides and DNA. Previously,
S-{[}1-(N-2-deoxyguanosinyl)methyl]GSH had been identified as the major
adduct formed in the reaction of GSCH(2)OAc with deoxyguanosine.
GSCH(2)OAc was incubated with the three remaining deoxyribonucleosides
to identify other possible adducts. Adducts to all three nucleosides
were found using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). The
adduct of GSCH(2)OAc and deoxyadenosine was formed in yield of up to
0.05\% and was identified as S-{[}1-(N-7-deoxyadenosinyl)methyl]GSH. The
pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside adducts were formed more efficiently,
resulting in yields of 1 and 2\% for the GSCH(2)OAc adducts derived from
thymidine and deoxycytidine, respectively, but their lability prevented
their structural identification by H-1 NMR. On the basis of the
available UV spectra, we propose the structures
S-{[}1-(N-3-thymidinyl)methyl]GSH and
S-{[}1-(N-4-deoxycytidinyl)methyl]GSH. Because adduct degradation
occurred most rapidly at alkaline and neutral pH values, an enzymatic
DNA digestion procedure was developed for the rapid hydrolysis of DNA to
deoxyribonucleosides at acidic pH. DNA digests were completed in less
than 2 h with a two-step method, which consisted of a 15 min incubation
of DNA with high concentrations of deoxyribonuclease II and
phosphodiesterase II at pH 4.5, followed by incubation of resulting
nucleotides with acid phosphatase. Analysis of the hydrolysis products
by HPLC-ESI-MS indicated the presence of the thymidine adduct.}},

	abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to determine the rat blood:air
partition coefficients (P-b:a) Of chloroform, bromodichloromethane,
dibromochloromethane and bromoform present in vitro individually or as
mixtures. The experimentally determined P-b:a Of chloroform,
bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform present
individually corresponded to (mean +/- SD, n = 8) 21.3 +/- 1.8, 41.8 +/-
6.2, 97.5 +/- 4.1, and 187 +/- 7.4, respectively. The P-b:a Of these
trihalomethanes (THMs) showed a decreasing trend during mixed in vitro
exposures to 0.138 +/- 0.002 or 0.273 +/- 0.002 mu mol of each of the
four THMs. In general, the P-b:a determined during mixed exposures
differed by less than or equal to 15\% of the average P-b:a determined
for THMs present individually. The results of this study suggest that an
alteration of P-b:a Of the individual THMs is unlikely to occur at the
blood concentrations of THMs observed during mixed exposures in rats.

	abstract = {{We conducted a field study in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Cobb County,
Georgia, ro evaluate exposure measures for disinfection by-products,
with special emphasis on trihalomethanes (THMs). Participants were
mothers living in either geographic area who had given birth to healthy
infants from June 1998 through May 1999. We assessed exposure by
sampling blood and water and obtaining information about water use
habits and tap water characteristics. Two 10-mL whole blood samples were
collected from each participant before and immediately after her shower.
Levels of individual THM species (chloroform, bromodichloromethane,
dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) were measured in whole blood
{[}parts per trillion (pptr)] and in water samples (parts per billion).
In the Corpus Christi water samples, brominated compounds accounted for
71\% of the total THM concentration by weight; in Cobb County,
chloroform accounted for 88\%. Significant differences in blood THM
levels were observed between study locations. For example, the median
baseline blood level of bromoform was 0.3 pptr and 3.5 pptr for
participants in Cobb County and Corpus Christi, respectively (p =
0.0001). Differences were most striking in blood obtained after
showering. For bromoform, the median blood levels were 0.5 pptr and 17
pptr for participants in Cobb County and Corpus Christi, respectively (p
= 0.0001). These results suggest that blood levels of THM species vary
substantially across populations, depending on both water quality
characteristics and water use activities. Such variation has important
implications for epidemiologic studies of the potential health effects
of disinfection byproducts.}},

	abstract = {{Disinfection by-products (DBP) are a side effect of water chlorination.
Some toxicological studies suggest an association between DBP exposure
and adverse reproductive and developmental effects. This investigation
considered all toxicological and epidemiological evidence for the
various effects, outcome by outcome. The weight of evidence demonstrated
that no association with DBP exposure exists for over a dozen outcomes
including low and very low birth weight, preterm delivery, some specific
congenital anomalies, and neonatal death. The analysis found
inconsistent or very weak results for all congenital anomalies/birth
defects, all central nervous system anomalies, neural tube defects,
spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. The weight of evidence suggested a
positive association with DBP exposure for some measure of growth
retardation (such as intrauterine growth retardation or small for
gestational age) and for urinary tract anomalies. Having catalogued
these effects, it should be noted that exposure assessment in the
epidemiological studies published to date has been inadequate to
definitively demonstrate an association of small magnitude. Exposure to
DBP primarily has been based on routine (i.e., quarterly) monitoring of
public water supplies for trihalomethanes (THM) matched to maternal
residence. In order to determine whether an association exists between
adverse reproductive and developmental effects and exposure to DBP,
studies must consider the THM concentration and the quantity of the
water actually consumed by pregnant women. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

	abstract = {{Chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform
comprise the trihalomethanes, a group of widespread and mildly
lipophilic compounds that result from water chlorination and other
sources. Many animal studies show the chronic toxicity and
carcinogenicity of these compounds, and recent work has demonstrated the
importance of both ingestion and inhalation exposure pathways. This
study presents partition coefficients describing the equilibrium among
biological compartments (air, water, blood, milk, urine) for the four
THMs based on results of headspace-gas chromatographic analyses
performed under equilibrium conditions and at 37degreesC. The calculated
partition coefficients ranged from 2.92 to 4.14 for blood/water,
1.54-2.85 for milk/blood, and 3.41-4.93 for blood/urine, with the lowest
being chloroform and the highest being bromoform. Both human and cow
milk were tested, with similar results. The available samples of human
milk may not fully account for differences in lipid content and possibly
other factors that affect estimates of partition coefficients.
Simultaneous measurements of milk and blood in exposed individuals are
suggested to confirm laboratory results. Partition coefficients are
predicted using the octanol-air partition coefficient, also measured in
this study, and the octanol-water partition coefficient. Results are
similar to literature estimates for liquid/air partitioning of
chloroform and chlorodibromomethane, but they differ from predictions
based on hydrophobicity and lipid content. High correlations between the
derived partitioned coefficients and the molecular structure (number of
Br atoms.) and physical properties (molecular weight and boiling point)
are found for these analogous chemicals. In humans, THMs are both stored
and metabolized with relatively rapid clearance rates, The derived
partition coefficients can help to interpret results of biological
monitoring and predict the potential for the accumulation and transfer
of chemicals, specifically by the application of physiologically-based
pharmacokinetic models. THM exposures to potentially susceptible
populations, e.g. nursing infants, can be predicted using either such
models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

@article{ISI:000174005100003,
	abstract = {{Previous data from our laboratory indicated that the drinking water
disinfection by-product, dibromoacetic acid (DBA), when applied in vitro
to rat preovulatory follicles at a concentration consistent with blood
levels found to disrupt estrous cyclicity, was able to block the
stimulated secretion of progesterone. The present experiments focused on
establishing a dose-response for such an effect and identifying the
point(s)of impact of this compound along the steroidogenic pathway that
underlie this suppression. Immature Sprague-Dawley rats were primed with
PMSG on day 26 and killed 48 h later. Preovulatory follicles were
removed and paired in culture with or without DBA (2-50 mug/ml) to
reassess progesterone secretion under hCG-stimulated or baseline
conditions. In addition, media supplemented with pregnenolone or
22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R-HC) were used to determine the effects of
50 mug/ml DBA on the initial steps leading to progesterone synthesis.
Samples taken over the course of 24 h reaffirmed a significant
DBA-associated suppression in baseline and stimulated progesterone
release, while estradiol secretion was unaffected. This effect was
mirrored by a reduction in follicular progesterone content in these DBA
groups. The addition of pregnenolone eliminated this decrease, with the
DBA-exposed follicles exhibiting a linear increase in progesterone
release over the sampling period. The follicular progesterone content at
24 h showed that DBA treatment under pregnenolone supplementation caused
marked elevations under both the hCG stimulated and non-stimulated
conditions, something not reflected in the release data. Substitution of
22R-HC for pregnenolone eliminated the effect on baseline progesterone
release, although the attenuation in stimulated secretion was still
present. This suggests both an effect of DBA exposure on mitochondrial
cholesterol transport by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (SCAR)
and a possible impact on the receptor or postreceptor events triggered
by hCG. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{Alkylation of DNA by acrolein and/or chloroacetaldehyde may result in
the mutations that lead to the therapy-induced leukemia associated with
cyclophosphamide (and ifosfamide) treatment. O-6-(n-Propanalyl)guanine
(O-6-PAG) and O-6-(ethanalyl)guanine (O-6-EAG) were synthesized for use
as authentic standards in investigations of DNA alkylation by acrolein
and chloroacetaldehyde, respectively. Preparation of the O-methyl oximes
of these aldehydes aided in confirming the structural assignments of
O-6-PAG and 06-EAG. HPLC was used to study the stability of O-6-PAG
under a variety of conditions. The decomposition of O-6-PAG was
attributed to an alpha,beta-elimination reaction resulting in the
formation of guanine and acrolein. In 0.1 M phosphate-DMSO (9:1),
O-6-PAG (1-10 mM) had a half-life of approximately 1 h (pH 7.4, 37
degreesC). In 0.05 M Tris-DMSO (9:1), the apparent half-life of O-6-PAG
(1-10 mM) was approximately 16 h (pH 7.4, 37 degreesC). The increased
lifetime under the latter conditions was attributed to a reversible
reaction between Tris and the aldehydic functionality of O-6-PAG to give
a more stable oxazolidine. Under conditions similar to those that would
be used for hydrolysis of DNA {[}0.1 M HCl-DMSO (98:2), pH 1.3, 70
degreesC, 30 min], there was an estimated 10-35\% loss of O-6-PAG. Under
the same conditions, 06-EAG had apparent half-lives of 6.6 h
(phosphate-DMSO) and 2.5 days (Tris-DMSO) and the estimated loss at pH
1.3 over 30 min (70 degreesC) was 15-20\%. Ab initio quantum chemical
calculations were used to understand the energy factors that underlie
the occurrence of O- versus N-alkylations as well as possible,
subsequent intramolecular cyclizations. Simulations of the free energies
of reactions between acrolein and guanine indicated that N-alkylation
was favored over O-6-alkylation and that cyclizations to tautomers were
most favorable if they involved the N-1 or NH2 positions.}},

	abstract = {{The inability to accurately assess exposure has been one of the major
shortcomings of epidemiologic studies of disinfection by-products (DBPs)
in drinking water. A number of contributing factors include a) limited
information on the identity, occurrence, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics
of the many DBPs that can be formed from chlorine, chloramine, ozone,
and chlorine dioxide disinfection; b) the complex chemical
interrelationships between DBPs and other parameters within a municipal
water distribution system; and c) difficulties obtaining accurate and
reliable information on personal activity and water consumption
patterns. In May 2000, an international workshop was held to bring
together various disciplines to develop better approaches for measuring
DBP exposure for epidemiologic studies. The workshop reached consensus
about the clear need to involve relevant disciplines (e.g., chemists,
engineers, toxicologists, biostatisticians and epidemiologists) as
partners in developing epidemiologic studies of DBPs in drinking water.
The workshop concluded that greater collaboration of epidemiologists
with water utilities and regulators should be encouraged in order to
make regulatory monitoring data more useful for epidemiologic studies.
Similarly, exposure classification categories in epidemiologic studies
should be chosen to make results useful for regulatory or policy
decision making.}},

	abstract = {{Trihalomethane (THM) concentrations in blood and tap water were measured
for 50 women living in two locations with different bromide
concentrations and disinfectant types. Blood samples were taken from
each woman early in the morning prior to any major water-use activity
and again immediately after showering. Each residence was sampled for
THMs in tap water prior to the woman's shower. Cobb County, GA, tap
water exhibited high THM concentrations composed primarily of
chloroform. Corpus Christi, TX, tap water exhibited lower THM
concentrations with significant proportions of brominated THMs, THMs in
tap water and blood were compared using mole fraction speciation, extent
of bromine incorporation, and correlation analysis, Results indicated
that THMs in the blood rose significantly as a result of showering, that
showering shifted the THM distribution in the blood toward that found in
the corresponding tap water, and that THMs measured in the blood of
women living in the two locations reflected species and concentration
differences in their respective tap waters. In general, blood
concentrations were not significantly correlated with tap water
concentrations. This finding suggests that other factors, in addition to
tap water concentrations, may be important in determining THM
concentrations in the blood.}},

	abstract = {{Objectives: For many decades chlorination has been used as a major
disinfectant process for public drinking and swimming pool water in many
countries. However, there has been rising concern over the possible link
between disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) and adverse reproductive
outcomes. The purpose of this study was to estimate the concentrations
of trihalomethanes (THMs) in some indoor swimming pools in London and
their variation within and between pools and any correlation with other
factors.
Methods: Water samples were collected from eight different indoor
swimming pools in London, A total of 44 pool samples were collected and
analysed for total organic content (TOC) and THMs. Water and air
temperature were measured along with the pH during the collection of
pool samples. The level of turbulence and the number of people in the
pool at the time were also assessed.
Results: The geometric mean concentration for all swimming pools of TOC
was 5.8 mg/l, of total THMs (TTHMs) 132.4 mug/l, and for chloroform
113.3 mug/l. There was a clear positive linear correlation between the
number of people in the swimming pool and concentrations of TTHMs and
chloroform, (r=0.7, p<0.01), and a good correlation between
concentrations of TOC and TTHMs (r=0.5, p<0.05) and water temperature
and concentrations of TTHMs (r=0.5, p<0.01). There was a larger
variation in THMs within pools than between pools.
Conclusion: Relatively high concentrations of THMs were found in
London's indoor swimming pools. The levels correlated with the number of
people in the pool, water temperature, and TOC. The variation in
concentrations of THMs was greater within pools than between pools.}},

contaminants results in the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs).
The volatile trihalomethanes and the nonvolatile haloacetic acids (HAAs)
are the most prevalent DBPs. It is important to monitor human exposure
to HAAs because of their potential adverse health effects, such as
cancer. Among the HAAs, urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) is a
potential valid biomarker for assessing chronic ingestion exposure to
HAAs from drinking water. We have developed a rugged, high-throughput,
sensitive, accurate, and precise assay for the measurement of trace
levels of TCAA in human urine using a simple solid-phase extraction
(SPE) cleanup followed by isotope dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). TCAA is extracted
from the urine using SPE, separated from other extract components by
reversed-phase HPLC, and analyzed by negative ion electrospray
ionization-isotope dilution-MS/MS using a multiple reaction monitoring
experiment. The method is simple and fast and is not labor intensive
(sample preparation and analysis can be performed in similar to15 min)
with a limit of detection of 0.5 ng/mL in 1 mL of urine.}},

	abstract = {{We addressed the need for a biomarker of ingestion exposure to drinking
water disinfection by-products by performing a human exposure trial. We
evaluated urinary excretion of trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) as an
exposure biomarker using 10 volunteers who normally consume their
domestic tap water. We recruited the volunteers at a water quality
research laboratory in Adelaide, Australia. Participants maintained a
detailed consumption and exposure diary over the 5-week study. We also
analyzed tap water and first morning urine (FMU) samples for TCAA, and
tap water for chloral hydrate (CH). We documented both interindividual
and intra-individual variability in TCAA ingestion and urinary
excretion, and both were substantial. With a TCAA-free bottled water
intervention, we used creatinine-adjusted urinary TCAA levels to
estimate urinary TCAA excretion half-lives for three of the
participants. We observed correspondence over time between estimated
TCAA excretion, calculated from TCAA + CH ingestion levels, and measured
TCAA urinary excretion. This study demonstrates the merits and
feasibility of using TCAA in FMU as an exposure biomarker, and reveals
remaining concerns about possible alternate sources of TCAA exposure for
individuals with low drinking water ingestion exposure.}},

6.37-6.59, the coadsorption of the binary complex of HSA-Th(IV) with
sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate occurs at the H2O/CCl4 interface,
forming an amphiphilic layer and displaying greatly enhanced TIR-RLS
signals with the maximum peak located at 340-370 nm. The enhanced
TIR-RLS intensity is in proportion to the HSA concentration in the range
0.15-1.0 mug ml(-1). The limit of detection is 14.4 ng ml(-1). The
contents of HSA in blood serum samples were determined with the recovery
of 97.1-102.3\% and RSD of 0.6-2.9\%, which are identical to those

	abstract = {{Trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), a known mouse liver carcinogen and a
possible human carcinogen, is found in chlorinated drinking water. We
measured TCAA in archived urine samples from a reference population of
402 adults using isotope-dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. TCAA was detected in 76\% of
the samples examined at concentrations ranging from < 0.5 mug TCAA/L to
more than 25 mug/L; the 90th percentile concentration was 23 mug/L (22
mug TCAA/g creatinine); and the geometric mean and median concentrations
were 2.9 mug/L (2.6 mug/g creatinine) and 3.3 mug/L (3.2 mug/g
creatinine), respectively. The frequency of detection of TCAA in urban
areas was higher than in rural areas (p = 0.00007), and sex and place of
residence (i.e., urban vs. rural) were found to have a significant
interaction in modulating the levels of TCAA (p = 0.012). Urban
residents had higher mean levels of TCAA (men, 5.3 mug/L, 3.8 mug/g
creatinine; women, 2.9 mug/L, 2.8 mug/g creatinine) than did rural
residents (men, 2.2 mug/L, 1.7 mug/g creatinine; women, 2.6 mug/L, 2.7
mug/g creatinine). The higher frequency of detection of TCAA in urban
than in rural areas and higher levels of TCAA among urban than among
rural residents may reflect the fact that urban residents use primarily
chlorinated water from public water supplies, whereas those in rural
areas are more likely to obtain water from private wells, which
typically are not chlorinated.}},

	abstract = {{Cancer of the urinary bladder and colon are significant human health
concerns. Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between
these cancers and the chronic consumption of chlorinated surface water
containing disinfection by-products (DBPs). The present study was
designed to determine if exposure to DBPs would cause preneoplastic or
neoplastic lesions in the urinary bladder and colon of rats, and what
effect a mixture of DBPs would have on these lesions. Male and female
Eker rats were treated via drinking water with low and high
concentrations of potassium bromate,
3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), chloroform,
or bromodichloromethane individually or in a mixture for 10 months. The
urinary bladders and colons were examined for the presence of
preneoplastic lesions. Cell proliferation in the urothelium was examined
using immunohistochemical staining for bromodeoxyuridine. Aberrant crypt
foci (ACF), as well as the number of individual crypts in each ACF, were
identified and counted microscopically after staining with 0.2\%
methylene blue. Colon crypt cell proliferation and mitotic index were
determined using immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell
nuclear antigen. Labeling indexes for the urinary bladder and colon were
calculated based on the percentage of positively labeled cells.
Treatment with the high dose of MX caused transitional epithelial
hyperplasia and cell proliferation in the rat urinary bladder, and this
effect was diminished in the high dose mixture animals. Treatment with 4
individual DBPs, as well as a mixture of them, caused the development of
ACF, the putative preneoplastic lesion of colon cancer.}},

	abstract = {{Aims: To examine the effect of trimester specific and pregnancy average
total trihalomethane (TTHM) exposure on infant birth weight, low birth
weight, and intrauterine growth retardation in term births, as well as
gestational age and preterm delivery in all births.
Methods: Cross sectional analysis of 56 513 singleton infants born to
residents of Massachusetts during 1990. City specific aggregate data
were used to estimate maternal exposure to TTHM concentration;
individual maternal information was used to adjust for confounding.
Results: Increased pregnancy average and second trimester TTHM exposure
were associated with small for gestational age and reductions in birth
weight after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Compared to
less than or equal to60 mug/l, pregnancy average TTHM exposure over 80
mug/l was associated with a 32 g reduction in birth weight. There was a
23 g reduction in birth weight in infants born to mothers exposed to
greater than 80 mug/l TTHM during the second trimester. For each 20
mug/l increase in TTHM, the estimated reduction in birth was 2.8 g for
pregnancy average exposure and 2.6 g for second trimester exposure. An
increased risk of small for gestational age births was found for
pregnancy average (odds ratio (OR) 1.14; 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.26) and
second trimester (OR 1.13, 95\% Cl 1.03 to 1.24) TTHM levels greater
than 80 mug/l. There was no evidence of an association between preterm
delivery and increased TTHM levels, but there were slight increases in
gestational duration associated with TTHM concentrations.
Conclusions: Maternal exposure to THMs may be associated with fetal
growth retardation. Our findings are consistent with most previous work,
although we generally found smaller effects of TTHMs on low birth weight
and intrauterine growth retardation.}},

	abstract = {{Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is a major by-product of water disinfection by
chlorination. Several studies have demonstrated that DCA exhibits
hepatocarcinogenic effects in rodents when administered in-drinking
water. This chemical does not appear to be highly mutagenic, and the
mechanism(s) involved in DCA induction-of cancer are not clear. The
present work was aimed at identifying changes in gene expression which
may indicate critical alterations/pathways involved in this chemical's
carcinogenic activities. We used cDNA microarray methods for analyses of
gene expression in livers of mice treated with the tumorigenic dose of 2
g/l DCA in drinking water for 4 weeks. Total RNA samples obtained from
livers of the control and DCA-treated mice were evaluated for gene
expression patterns with Clontech Atlas(TM) Mouse 1.2 cDNA and Atlas(TM)
mouse stress/toxicology arrays, and the data analyzed with AtlasImage
2.01 and one-way ANOVA in JMP4 software. From replicate experiments, we
identified 24 genes with altered expression, of which 15 were confirmed
by Northern blot analysis. Of the 15 genes, 14 revealed expression
suppressed two- to five-fold; they included the following: MHR 23A,
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C29, CYP 3A11, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1
(PON 1), liver carboxylesterase, alpha- 1 antitrypsin, ER p72,
glutathione S-transferase (GST) Pi 1, angiogenin, vitronectin precursor,
cathepsin D (CTSD), plasminogen precursor (contains angiostatin),
prothrombin precursor and integrin alpha 3 precursor (ITGA 3). An
additional gene, CYP 2A4/5, had a two-fold elevation in expression.
Further, in ancillary Northern analyses of total RNA isolated from
DCA-induced hepatocellular carcinomas (from earlier reported studies of
mice treated with 3.5 g/l DCA for 93 weeks), many of the same genes (11
of 15) noted above showed a similar alteration in expression. In
summary, we have identified specific genes involved in the functional
categories of cell growth, tissue remodeling, apoptosis, cancer
progression and xenobiotic metabolism that have altered levels of
expression following exposures to DCA. These findings serve to highlight
new pathways in which to further probe DCA effects that may be critical
to its tumorigenic activity. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

@article{ISI:000181901200003,
	abstract = {{Human exposure to trihalomethanes such as chloroform has been associated
with both cancer and reproductive toxicity. While there is little
evidence for chloroform mutagenicity or DNA adduct formation, in vivo
studies in rats have demonstrated adduction to histones and other
nuclear proteins. Histones play a key role in controlling DNA expression
particularly through the acetylation of lysine residues in their
N-termini. Therefore, we studied the reaction of phosgene, the major
active metabolite of chloroform, with the N-terminus of human histone
H2B (Hpep,
Pro-Glu-Pro-Ala-Lys-Ser-Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro-Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser-Lys-Lys-Ala-Val-
Thr-Lys-Ala-Gln-Lys) in a model chemical system. The aim of this study
was to assess whether phosgene is able to form irreversible adducts with
this peptide and to investigate which residues are most susceptible.
Hpep was reacted with a range of phosgene concentrations (0.03-36 mM) at
37 degreesC, pH 7.4. The products of these reactions, analyzed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS, showed that up to three
CO moieties could be adducted to the peptide. The singly and doubly
adducted peptides were purified by HPLC and then hydrolyzed with trypsin
to produce a series of fragments that were analyzed by HPLC-MS. The
tryptic products showed that adduction occurred principally at lysine
residues, and that all seven lysine residues of the peptide were subject
to adduction. Collision-induced dissociation analysis using ion trap
MS-MS of the tryptic fragment
{[}Pro-Glu-Pro-Ala-Lys-Ser-Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro-Lys + CO] and of the
full-length singly adducted peptide supported the role of lysine
residues in adduction; the data also indicated that the N-terminal
proline and the serine residues are susceptible. Addition of glutathione
to the reaction mixture only partially attenuated adduct formation and
allowed production of another adducted species, i.e.,
Hpep-CO-glutathione. The occurrence of such reactions to the N-termini
of histones, if confirmed by in vivo studies, could help to explain the
mechanism of chloroform carcinogenicity.}},

and chloroform uptake in pregnant women to assess the potential extent
of exposure measurement error in epidemiologic studies of the health
effects of exposure to water disinfection by-products. Data from the
literature were used to assign statistical distributions to swimming
pool chloroform concentrations, frequency and duration of swimming,
showering and bathing, and average tap water consumption. Measured
increases in blood chloroform concentrations after these activities were
used to estimate average uptake per microgram per liter chloroform in
the water, per minute spent in the activity or per liter consumed. Given
average tap water chloroform concentrations from a U.K. epidemiologic
study, an average daily uptake over 90 days was simulated for 300,000
mothers. The correlation between simulated uptakes and home tap
chloroform concentration was 0.6. Mothers who swam regularly received
far greater doses than did nonswimmers. Results suggest there will be
considerable attenuation in risk estimates and/or power loss in
epidemiologic studies if the putative agent is chloroform.}},

for tenofovir in human plasma has been developed and validated.
Tenofovir was isolated from a 200 RI plasma sample using protein
precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The fluorescent 1,N-6-etheno
derivative is formed at 98 degreesC in the buffered extract with
chloroacetaldehyde. This derivative was analysed using gradient ion-pair
liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection at 254 run for
excitation and 425 run for emission. In the evaluated concentration
range (20-1000 ng/nl), the intra-day precision was 4\% and the inter-day
precision was 5-6\%. An accuracy of between 97 and 110\% was determined.
The lower limit of quantification was 20 ng/ml with an inter-day
precision of 11\%, an intra-day precision of 12\% and an accuracy of
103\%. The assay is subject to interference from co-administered
abacavir. The usefullness of the assay was demonstrated for samples
obtained from an HIV-infected patient treated with tenofovir. (C) 2003

@article{ISI:000184251000001,
	abstract = {{The subchronic toxicity of dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN), a disinfection
by-product in drinking water, was studied in the rat. Male (180+/-18 g)
and female (152+/-9 g) Sprague-Dawley rats (10 animals per group) were
fed DBAN in organic-free distilled water at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10
and 100 ppm for 13 weeks. Control rats received organic-free distilled
water only. Water intakes in the highest dose males and females were
reduced by 25 and 32\% as compared to the controls, respectively
(P<0.05), with no significant reductions in food consumption and body
weight gain. The organ to body weight ratio was significantly increased
in the highest-dose males and females for kidneys but not for the brain,
liver, spleen, thymus and testicles. In the males, decreases were
detected in serum uric acid levels at I and 100 ppm, and in urinary uric
acid at 10 and 100 ppm. Decreased serum protein was detected in the
highest-dose males and decreased serum LDH was found in the highest-dose
females. Both the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts were
significantly elevated in the highest-dose females. A significant
increase in hepatic catalase activity was observed only in males
starting at I ppm, and increased palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (PCO) activity
was found in males and females of the highest dose group. In the males,
decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) level was
detected in the liver at 1.0 and 100 ppm groups, while increased TBARS
was found in the serum at 100 ppm DBAN. No treatment-related changes
were detected in the activities of hepatic benzyloxyresorufin
O-dealkylase (BROD), pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) and
ethoxresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), and in hepatic
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) and glutathione S-transferases
(GST). Although DBAN is a potent inhibitor of hepatic aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) and GST in vitro, there was no evidence of
suppression of these enzymes in the treated animals. Mild histological
changes were detected in animals receiving the highest dose, consisting
of collapsed angularity, increased epithelial height in the thyroid of
both sexes, and cytoplasmic vacuolation and nuclear vesiculation in the
thyroid of females, increased myeloid to erythroid ratio in the bone
marrow of both sexes, and cytoplasmic inclusions in the proximal tubules
of male kidneys. In summary, treatment effects occurred predominantly at
100 ppm and included in both sexes: increased kidney weights,
histological changes in the thyroid and bone marrow, and increased
peroxisomal enzyme activities; and in males: decreased serum and urinary
uric acid levels, and indication of oxidative stress. The
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was therefore judged to be 10
ppm, equivalent to 1.11 and 1.21 mg/kg/day in the males and females,
respectively. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

	abstract = {{Haloacetic acids (HAAS) are environmentally and medically important
chemicals. No analytical method is currently available to analyze
EPA-regulated HAAs in biological samples at environmentally relevant low
concentrations. Clinical studies of this class of chemicals are also
limited by the lack of analytical techniques of high sensitivity and
precision. We now report a new analytical method using gas
chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry for quantifying nine HAAS
present in plasma, urine, and water at picogram per milliliter levels.
The derivatization reactions of HAAs with pentafluorobenzyl bromide were
optimized and detection with an electron capture negative ion chemical
ionization mode was employed to enhance the sensitivity. Selected ion
monitoring and selected reaction monitoring methods were utilized for
quantitation. The detection limits of HAAS in plasma, urine, and water
were 25-1000 pg/mL. Accuracies varied from 86.6 to 118.1\% (intraday).
and 81.7 to 119.6\% (interday). Precisions (CV) varied from 0.9 to
19.9\% (intraday) and 0.8 to 19.8\% (interday), and linearities (r(2))
varied from 0.9732 to 0.9998 (intraday) and 0.9422 to 0.9987 (interday),
respectively. Methyl tertbutyl ether and diethyl ether provided the
highest extraction recoveries for the HAAs (74.9-107.2\%). The method
was applied successfully to a kinetic investigation of low levels of
HAAs in humans consuming chlorinated drinking water.}},

	abstract = {{Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a mouse liver carcinogen, is a drinking
water contaminant and a metabolite of solvents such as trichloroethylene
and perchloroethylene. Because acidic drugs are often bound more
strongly to human than to rodent plasma proteins, a study was undertaken
to determine whether this was the case for TCA and to clarify the
mechanistic bases for species differences. Equilibrium dialysis was used
to measure in vitro binding of a range of TCA concentrations to plasma
of humans, rats, and mice. Plots of observed data for free versus bound
TCA concentrations were compared with simulations from each of three
binding models: a single saturable site model; a saturable plus
nonsaturable site model; and a two-saturable site model. Dissociation
values (K-d) did not differ significantly from one species to another,
but N (number of binding sites/molecule) ranged from 2.97 for humans to
0.17 for mice. Binding capacities (B-max) for humans, rats, and mice
were 709, 283, and 29 muM, respectively. The greater plasma protein
binding of TCA in humans would be expected to not only increase the
residence time of the compound in the bloodstream, but to substantially
reduce the proportion of TCA that is available for uptake by the liver
and other tissues. Species differences in the bound fraction diminished
at very low, environmentally relevant TCA concentrations, but the
percentage bound increased markedly. These findings suggest that the
practice of using total blood levels of TCA as a dose metric in
interspecies extrapolation of cancer risks needs to be re-examined.}},

	abstract = {{Background: Trihalomethanes (THMs) are byproducts of drinking water
chlorination whose effects on semen quality have not been previously
studied in humans.
Methods: We examined the relationship of THMs to semen quality in 157
healthy men from couples without known risk factors for infertility.
Total THM (TTHM) levels were assigned based on water utility
measurements taken during the 90 days preceding semen collection. We
analyzed continuous semen parameters in relation to total and individual
THMs, adjusting for potential confounders by using repeated measures
analyses.
Results: TTHM level was not associated with decrements in semen quality.
Percent normal morphology decreased and percent head defects increased
at higher levels of an ingestion metric (TTHM multiplied by cold home
tap water consumption). At the highest level of the ingestion metric
(>160 mug/L X glasses/day, which is equivalent to >2 glasses/day of
water containing 80 mug/L) we observed a difference of -7.1 (95\%
confidence interval = -12.7 to -1.6) for percent morphologically normal
sperm compared with the lowest level (less than or equal to 40 mug/L X
glasses/day). Of the individual THMs, bromodichloromethane exposure was
inversely related to linearity (a motility parameter); we observed a
small decrease (beta = -0.09, SE 0.04) for every unit increase in
bromodichloromethane.
Conclusion: Although our study had a limited exposure assessment and a
selective sample, our results suggest the need for further study of the
effects of THMs on semen quality.}},

Modified surface characterized by ATR-FTIR technique indicated formation
of saturated and unsaturated cross-linked product. On the basis of

bromoacetic acids in water was developed by online coupling
anion-exchange chromatography separation to element-specific inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. Factors affecting
the chromatographic and ICP-MS performances were systematically
investigated. The separation was achieved on a Dionex IonPac(R) AS11-HC
column (4.0x250 mm) by elution with 100 mM ammonium nitrate. The
detection limits (3sigma) of the analytes were 0.13-0.36 mug L(-1) based
on a 500-muL sample injection. The possible masking of bromochloroacetic
acid by the relatively high level of bromide in the chromatogram was
avoided by sample pretreatment with Dionex OnGuard(R) Ag and H
cartridges. The sample matrix did not show significant influence on the
analysis. The method has been applied to analysis of various waters with
good precisions and spiked recoveries of 80.8-113.8\%.}},

@article{ISI:000187988800013,
	abstract = {{Previously, we demonstrated that bromodichloromethane (BDCM), a drinking
water disinfection by-product, causes pregnancy loss in F344 rats when
given on gestational days (GD) 6-10, encompassing the luteinizing
hormone (LH)-dependent period of pregnancy (GD 7-10). Pregnancy loss,
i.e., full-litter resorption, was associated with reduced serum
progesterone levels; however, we were unable to identify an effect on
serum LH. Here, we reevaluated serum LH levels using the more sensitive
technique, DELFIA(R). We further sought to better define the temporal
pattern of endocrine disruption caused by BDCM during pregnancy with
more frequent sampling. Lastly, we attempted to prevent BDCM-induced
pregnancy loss using exogenous progesterone or human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), an LH-agonist. BDCM, in 10\% Alkamuls(R), was dosed
at 75 mg/kg/day by gavage to F344 rats on GD 6-10 (plug day = GD 0).
BDCM-induced pregnancy loss was associated with marked reductions in
serum progesterone and LH on GD 10. The decrease in serum LH
consistently preceded the decrease in progesterone. In the hormone
replacement studies, BDCM and progesterone were administered on GD 6-10,
hCG on GD 8-10. BDCM was delivered at 100 mg/kg/day, progesterone at 10
mg/kg twice daily, and hCG at 0.5 IU/0.2 ml/rat. Both progesterone and
hCG prevented BDCM-induced pregnancy loss. Thus, BDCM-induced pregnancy
loss was associated with marked GD-10 reductions in serum LH and
corresponding decreases in progesterone. Furthermore, coadministration
of an LH agonist prevented pregnancy loss, supporting the hypothesis
that BDCM-induced pregnancy loss in the rat occurs via an LH-mediated
mode of action.}},

	abstract = {{The dihalomethane CH2Cl2 is an industrial solvent of potential concern
to humans because of its potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. To
characterize DNA damage by dihalomethanes, a rapid DNA digestion under
acidic conditions was developed to identify alkali labile
DNA-dihalomethane nucleoside adducts using HPLC-electrospray mass
spectrometry. DNA digestion worked best using pH 5.0 sodium acetate
buffer, a 30 min incubation with DNase II and phosphodiesterase II, and
a 2 h acid phosphatase digest. DNA was modified with
S-(1-acetoxymethyl)glutathione (GSCH(2)OAc), a reagent modeling
activated dihalomethanes. Adducts to G, A, and T were detected at high
ratios of GSCH(2)OAc/DNA following digestion of the DNA with the
procedure used here. The relative efficacy of adduct formation was G > T
> A much greater than C. The four DNA nucleosides were also reacted with
the dihalomethanes CH2Cl2 and CH2Br2 in the presence of glutathione
(GSH) and GSH S-transferases from bacteria (DM11), rat (GST 5-5), and
human (GST T1-1) under conditions that produce mutations in bacteria.
All enzymes formed adducts to all four nucleosides, with dGuo being the
most readily modified nucleoside. Thus, the pattern paralleled the
results obtained with the model compounds GSCH(2)OAc and DNA. CH2Cl2 and
CH2Br2 yielded similar amounts of adducts under these conditions. The
relative efficiency of adduct formation by GSH transferases was rat 5-5
> human T1-1 > bacterial DM11, showing that human GSH transferase T1-1
can form dihalomethane adducts under the conditions used. Although the
lability of DNA adducts has precluded more sophisticated experiments and
in vivo studies have not yet been possible, the work collectively
demonstrates the ability of several GSH transferases to generate DNA
adducts from dihalomethanes, with G being the preferred site of
adduction in both this and the GSCH(2)OAc model system.}},

	abstract = {{The formation of a covalent adduct to a single phospholipid by the
oxidative chloroform metabolite, phosgene, is demonstrated in liver
mitochondria of phenobarbital-pretreated Sprague Dawley (SD) rats
treated with CHCl3. The densitometric analysis of the phosphorus stained
extracted phospholipids showed that the formation of this adduct in
liver mitochondria is accompanied by a decrease of
phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin. The characterization of this
adduct was performed with a multinuclear NMR approach by comparison with
the decreased phospholipids. Treatment of rats with {[}C-13]chloroform
resulted in an intense C-13 NMR peak from either an esteric or amidic
carbonyl. Very strong similarities in fatty acid composition were found
between phosphatidylethanolamine and the phosgene-modified PL, using
C-13 and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. A multiplet at 3.91 ppm coupled to a
signal at 3.41 ppm was shown by two-dimensional H-1 NMR in the adduct
spectrum. This cross peak was interpreted as arising from the shifted
resonances of the two PE head group methylene groups, due to the binding
with phosgene. P-31 spectrum of the adduct was identical to that of
phosphatidylethanolamine. We concluded that the chloroform adduct is a
modified phosphatidylethanolamine, with the phosgene-derived carbonyl
bound to the amine of the head group. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

examined in male rats with a view toward effective clinical treatment
for MCA intoxication. Rats were injected with 80 mg/kg sodium
monochloroacetate (SMCA) (single lethal dose) and then infused with
saline (control group) or 5\% or 10\% glucose solution at 2 mL/hour for
ten hours. No animal in the control group survived the total 14-day
follow-up period. The survival rate in 5\% glucose group was 57\% at ten
hours; it decreased to 14\% at 14 days. The survival rate in 10\%
glucose group was 79\% at ten hours, and all rats that survived the
first ten hours also survived the 14 days. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed
the survival rate in 10\% glucose group to be improved upon in both the
5\% glucose group and the control group. Blood glucose and lactate
levels were measured every hour during infusion. Blood glucose levels
decreased in the control group but remained in the glucose-infused
groups. Although the blood lactate level increased in each group, there
was an excellent inverse linear relation between blood glucose levels
and blood lactate levels. Thus, continuous parenteral infusion of
glucose solution at an early stage after exposure may be an effective
clinical therapy for the prevention of hypoglycaemia and metabolic
lactic acidosis caused by MCA.}},

	abstract = {{A new method for the determination of nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) with
ion chromatography (1C) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed. With the very hydrophilic
anion-exchange column and steep gradient of sodium hydroxide, the nine
HAAs could be well separated in 15 min. After suppression with an ASRS
suppressor that was introduced in between IC and ICP-MS, the background
was much decreased, the interference caused by sodium ion present in
eluent was removed, and the sensitivities of HAAs were greatly improved.
The chlorinated and brominated HAAs could be detected as (CIO)-C-35 and
Br-79 without interference of the matrix due to the elemental selective
ICP-MS. The detection limits for mono-, di-, trichloroacetic acids were
between 15.6 and 23.6 mug/l. For the other six bromine-containing HAAs,
the detection limits were between 0.34 and 0.99 mug/l. With the
pretreatment of OnGuard Ag cartridge to remove high concentration of
chloride in sample, the developed method could be applied to the
determination of HAAs in many drinking water matrices. (C) 2004 Elsevier

	abstract = {{To determine if dibromoacetic acid (DBA) affects ovarian
folliculogenesis, four groups of female Dutch-belted rabbits were
exposed daily to 0, 1, 5, or 50 mg DBA/kg body weight in drinking water
beginning in utero from gestation day 15 throughout life. Functionality
of the endocrine axis was assessed by measuring serum concentrations of
gonadotropins following an im injection of 10 mug GnRH at 12
(prepubertal; n = 6/dose group) and 24 (postpubertal; n = 10/dose group)
weeks of age. A day after GnRH challenge, number of ovulation sites and
ovarian weights were determined at necropsy. Left ovaries were processed
for histopathology, serially sectioned at 6 mum, and every twelfth
section stained with hematoxylin and eosin was evaluated. All healthy
follicles were categorized as primordial, primary, small preantral,
large preantral, or small antral follicles. The area of each section
evaluated was measured and the number of follicles in each category
expressed per mm(2) unit area. In prepubertal animals, DBA caused a
reduction in number of primordial follicles (p < 0.05) and total healthy
follicles (p < 0.05) at 50 mg/kg dose level. In adult animals, there
were fewer primordial follicles in both the 5 (p < 0.01) and 50 (p =
0.1) mg/kg dose groups. No profound changes in gonadotropin profiles
were observed. Although chronic exposure to DBA did not appear to have
an effect on late follicular development or ovulation, DBA did reduce
the population of primordial follicles. The long-term health
consequences of diminished primordial follicles are unknown, but it is
very likely that reproductive senescence would occur earlier.}},

trichloroacetic acid (TCAA).
Methods: A longitudinal pilot exposure/intervention study measured the
elimination half life of TCAA in urine. Beverage consumption was limited
to a public water supply and bottled water of known TCAA concentration,
and ingestion volume was managed. The five participants limited fluid
consumption to only the water provided. Consumption journals were kept
by each participant and their daily first morning urine (FMU) samples
were analysed for TCAA and creatinine. TCAA elimination half life curves
were generated from a two week washout period using TCAA-free bottled
water.
Results: Individual elimination half lives ranged from 2.1 to 6.3 days,
for single compartment exponential decay, the model which fit the data.
Conclusion: Urinary TCAA is persistent enough to be viable as a
biomarker of medium term (days) exposure to drinking water TCAA
ingestion within a range of realistic concentrations.}},

100 mg/kg/day for 5 days a week for 28 days excreted large amounts of
formic acid in their urine, which was accompanied by a change in urinary
pH. Male B6C3F1 mice exposed to BDCM at 25 or 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days a
week for 28 days also excreted increased amounts of formic acid in their
urine. In rats, formate excretion was dose and time dependant, being
markedly elevated after four doses and remaining at that level after 3
weeks of dosing at 100 mg/kg/day BDCM, while at 50 mg/kg/day there was
some suggestion of a decline after 3 weeks. In contrast, in mice formate
excretion did not start to a major extent until 3 weeks of dosing, with
the biggest response at 4 weeks. There was no increase in clinical
chemistry markers of liver or kidney injury in either rats or mice
following 28-day exposure to BDCM. However, morphological examination of
the kidneys showed some mild renal tubule injury in two out of five rats
exposed to 100 mg/kg/day BDCM. This was associated with a marked
increase in cell proliferation in the renal cortex of all rats exposed
to 100 mg/kg/day. No increase in cell proliferation was seen in the
renal cortex of rats exposed to BDCM at 50 mg/kg/day, or in mice exposed
to 25 or 50 mg/kg/day BDCM for 28 days. Long-term exposure to formic
acid is known to cause kidney damage, suggesting that excretion of this
acid may be a contributory factor to the increase in cell proliferation
and kidney damage seen in the longer-term studies with BDCM.}},

a fundamental step in phototherapy of newborns with neonatal jaundice.
Here we report results of an ultrafast optical spectroscopy study of
bilirubin in CHCl3 as well as bound to human serum albumin. The data
show that the initially excited singlet state has sub-ps decay times
with major amplitude. Transient absorption measurements reveal that the
ultrafast decay of the emission is accompanied by the formation of a
transient intermediate which decays on the 15-20 ps timescale. The
initial photoprocesses are thus considerably faster than the previously
reported fastest lifetimes for bilirubin and this is, to our knowledge,
the first time that the earliest processes in excited bilirubin have
been resolved.}},

	abstract = {{There have been many fatal occupational accidents of skin exposure to
monochloroacetic acid (MCA). However, there have been no reports of
dermatological findings and the lethal consequences have not yet been
demonstrated. Therefore, harmful local and systemic effects were
investigated after dermal exposure to MCA. A 0.5 mL aliquot of MCA
solution ( 40\% w/w) was applied to the abdominal skin of ten
10-week-old male SD rats under anesthesia. The exposure area ( 25 x 25
mm 2) was 1.6\% of the total surface area. The dose of MCA per area was
34.1 mg/cm(2). Saline was similarly administered to 10 control rats.
Histopathological findings after 10 min were observed by light
microscopy. Blood samples were collected by exsanguinations from the
carotid arteries after 4 h. Skin samples were collected 10 min after the
initial exposure. Histological findings showed severe degeneration of
collagen bundles in the epidermis and subcutaneous tissues. P-CO2,
HCO3-, TCO2, BE and glucose levels were decreased in the MCA group. AST,
m-AST, ALT, BUN, Cr, NH3, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, RBC, Hb, Hct, total
protein and albumin were increased in the MCA group. The burn was
determined to be a third-degree burn on the basis of the
histopathological findings. The severe toxicity was probably a
consequence of the rapid permeability. Biochemical parameters were a
consequence of hepatocellular injuries, renal dysfunction,
dysglyconeogenesis and dysfunction of ammonia metabolism. MCA reportedly
enters the TCA cycle and inhibits aconitase. MCA metabolites also
inhibit pyruvate carboxylase in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Therefore,
the important serum biochemical abnormalities such as hypoglycemia and
lactic acidosis should be monitored to find the acute systemic
disorders.}},

weaning (in utero + lactational exposure). At postnatal d 1 (PNDI) pups
of dams exposed to chloroform had significantly higher serum glucose
levels and lower insulin levels, but this effect was not due to P-cell
depletion in the neonatal pancreas. Glucose homeostasis in response to a
glucose challenge was not changed by chloroform treatment. Chloroform
exposure did not affect birthweight; however, offspring of dams exposed
to chloroform had significantly impaired postnatal growth. Although
fetal and neonatal exposure to chloroform did not elicit physiological
changes associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes, there were

	abstract = {{Elevated gavage exposures to the drinking water disinfection by-product
dibromoacetic acid (DBA) have been found to disrupt estrous cyclicity in
the rat and induce increases in estradiol concentrations in both cycling
(day of estrus) and ovariectomized/estradiol-implanted females. The
present study was designed to investigate both effects in Sprague-Dawley
rats following an extended 20-week treatment with lower dosages of DBA
administered in the drinking water (calculated mean intake
concentrations of 5, 16, and 33 mg/kg/d). No treatment-related effects
on cyclicity were present, although elevations in serum estradiol on the
day of vaginal estrus were noted in regularly cycling rats when assessed
at the 3rd and 11th weeks of exposure. By the 19th week, this effect was
no longer present in cycling animals, but its absence was attributable
to a marked increase in control estradiol concentrations, which may be
associated with endocrine alterations that precede a disruption in
estrous cyclicity in middle-aged females. In the 20th week, diestrous
estrone levels were elevated at all dosages without effects on serum and
rostenedione or progesterone. Uterine and pituitary weights were
unchanged at this time, although there were modest increases in liver
weights at the two highest dosages. A small number of rats in persistent
estrus (PE) did show a general increase in pituitary weight associated
with DBA exposure, possibly reflecting an added layering of treatment on
the PE-associated rise in estradiol normally seen in these females. The
results indicate that increases in circulating estradiol from drinking
water exposures to DBA were not linked to a premature disruption of
estrous cyclicity in this moderately estrogen-sensitive rat strain. (c)

	abstract = {{Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is a compound found in chlorinated drinking
water. In addition, the compound is a metabolite of several halogenated
solvents, including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE).
Exposure to DCA is of concern because high doses of the compound have
been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Dosages of TCE
administered to animals in cancer studies are designed to elicit maximal
DCA formation in vivo, whereas levels of DCA to which individuals are
exposed in drinking water are very low. Analysis of DCA in biological
samples has been quite challenging. Derivatizing reagents commonly used
to convert DCA into a more volatile form for analysis by gas
chromatography (GC) have been found to convert trichloroacetic acid
(TCA), a major metabolite of TCE and PCE, into DCA. High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis does not require derivatization of
DCA and can thus avoid this problem. However, the most popular
stationary phases in HPLC columns do not retain small, polar compounds
such as DCA well. The liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
(LC/MS/MS) method described in this paper uses hydrophilic interaction
liquid chromatography (HILIC), a type of chromatography that is able to
retain these small, polar compounds. Method validation was performed
using the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and
International Conference on Harmonziation (ICH) Guidance for Industry:
Bioanalytical Method Validation as a guide. Levels of DCA found in rats
dosed with 2g/kg TCE were 17.2ng/mL (liver), 262.4ng/mL (kidney), 175.1
ng/mL (lung), and 39.5 ng/mL (blood). Copyright (c) 2003 John Wiley \&

	abstract = {{A method for the determination of volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons,
namely dichloromethane (TCM), trichloroethylene (TCE), and
perchloroethylene (PCE), in urine samples was developed using headspace
solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS). HS-SPME was performed using a 75 \&mu; m
Carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane fiber. Factors, which affect the HS-SPME
process, such as adsorption and desorption times, stirring, salting-out
effect, and temperature of sampling have been evaluated and optimized.
The highest extraction efficiency was obtained when sampling was
performed at room temperature (22\&DEG; C), from samples saturated with
salt and under agitation. Linearity of the HS-SPME-GC-MS method was
established over four orders of magnitude and the limit of detection was
0.005 \&mu; g/l for all the compounds. Precision, calculated as \%R.S.D.
at three different concentration levels, was within 1-8\% for all intra-
and inter-day determinations. The method was applied to the quantitative
determination of TCE and PCE in human urine samples from exposed (TCE, n
= 5; median, 9.32 \&mu; g/l and PCE, n = 39; median, 0.58 \&mu; g/l) and
non-exposed individuals (n = 120; median concentrations, 0.64, 0.22 and
0.11 \&mu; g/l for DCM, TCE and PCE, respectively. In addition, two
cases of acute accidental exposure to DCM are reported, and the
elimination kinetics in blood and urine was followed up. The calculated
half-lives of urinary and blood DCM were, respectively, 7.5 and 8.1 h
for one subject and 3.8 and 4.3 h for the other. \&COPY; 2005 Elsevier

	abstract = {{Individual exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) in tap water can occur
through ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure. Studies indicate that
activities associated with inhaled or dermal exposure routes result in a
greater increase in blood THM concentration than does ingestion. We
measured blood and exhaled air concentrations of THM as biomarkers of
exposure to participants conducting 14 common household water use
activities, including ingestion of hot and cold tap water beverages,
showering, clothes washing, hand washing, bathing, dish washing, and
indirect shower exposure. We conducted our study at a single residence
in each of two water utility service areas, one with relatively high and
the other low total THM in the residence tap water. To maintain a
consistent exposure environment for seven participants, we controlled
water use activities, exposure time, air exchange, water flow and
temperature, and nonstudy THM sources to the indoor air. We collected
reference samples for water supply and air (pre-water use activity), as
well as tap water and ambient air samples. We collected blood samples
before and after each activity and exhaled breath samples at baseline
and postactivity. All hot water use activities yielded a 2-fold increase
in blood or breath THM concentrations for at least one individual. The
greatest observed increase in blood and exhaled breath THM concentration
in any participant was due to showering (direct and indirect), bathing,
and hand dishwashing. Average increase in blood THM concentration ranged
from 57 to 358 pg/mL due to these activities. More research is needed to
determine whether acute and frequent exposures to THM at these
concentrations have public health implications. Further research is also
needed in designing epidemiologic studies that minimize data collection
burden yet maximize accuracy in classification of dermal and inhalation
THM exposure during hot water use activities.}},

the synthesis, repair, and functioning of DNA and are required for the
production and maintenance of cells. Low levels of folate have been
associated with several forms of cancer, including colon cancer.
Aberrant crypt foci (ACF), identified as putative precursor lesions in
the development of colon cancer, have been induced by the drinking water
disinfection by-product, tribromomethane (TBM). To investigate whether
ACF induced by TBM could be promoted by a diet devoid of dietary folate,
male F344/N rats were exposed to 500 mg/l of TBM in drinking water and
fed either a normal or no folate diet (NFD) for 26 weeks. At the
conclusion of the study, colons were excised and examined for ACF. Rats
exposed to TBM and fed a NFD, evident by significantly reduced serum
folate concentrations and elevated serum homocysteine levels, had
significant increases of ACF when compared to rats exposed to TBM and
fed a normal diet. This study highlights the important role that diet,
especially folate intake, represents in protecting the colon against
TBM-induced ACF. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

	abstract = {{Trichloroethylene (TCE) and some of its metabolites are potentially
carcinogenic compounds that the general population is commonly exposed
to in drinking water. Concentrations of TCE, dichloroacetic acid (DCA)
and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) given to laboratory animals in cancer
bioassays are high, whereas drinking water levels of the compounds are
very low. It is not clear whether the trace amounts of TCE, DCA and TCA
in drinking water pose a cancer risk to humans. The accuracy of
pharmacokinetic studies relies on the analytical method from which blood
and tissue concentration data are obtained. Models that extrapolate
cancer risks of TCE and its metabolites from laboratory animals to
humans, in turn, rely on the results of pharmacokinetic studies.
Therefore, it is essential to have reliable analytical methods for the
analysis of TCE and its metabolites. This paper reviews the methods
currently in the literature for the analysis of TCE, DCA, TCA and, to a
lesser extent, chloral hydrate (CH). Additional aspects of analytical
methods such as method validation, species preservation and future
directions in the analysis of TCE and its metabolites are also
discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

packed-bed reactor, has been used to study the formation of NOx and N2O
during the plasma destruction of a range of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants, including chlorinated, brominated,
fluorinated, and iodinated methane species, in a carrier gas of air.
Using the plasma destruction of pure air as a baseline, it is found that
the amount of NOx formed is unaffected by the addition of a few hundred
parts per million of a simple hydrocarbon (e.g. methane). In the case of
the fluorinated, chlorinated, and brominated methanes, we find enhanced
production of NOx, and a marked increase in the ratio of NO2 to NO
formed, from similar to 1.1 in air and methane to similar to 2.3 in
halogenated species. However, iodinated additives (specifically methyl
iodide and diiodomethane) have remarkably different results compared to
the other halogenated additives; they show enhanced increases in the NO2
to NO ratio (similar to 6-13) and reduced NOx production. The enhanced
conversion of NO to NO2 is attributed to reactions involving halogen
oxides, e.g. ClO and IO.}},

	abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to develop a method of urinalysis for
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and trichloroethanol (TCE), and therefore
total trichloro-compounds (TTC) as the sum, with least use of hazardous
chemicals, being green in that sense. After acid hydrolysis followed by
dilution with an ethanol (EtOH)-methanol (MeOH)-water mixture, capillary
gas-choromatography with an electron-capture detector can quantify TCA
and TCE in the diluted hydrolyzate. Comparison studies showed that the
results were identical among three methods, i.e., 1. the method
developed in the present study, 2. a head-space GC with acid hydrolysis
of conjugated TCE and methylesterification of TCA(1)), and 3.
traditional colorimetry with Fujiwara reaction(2)). When applied to
exposure - excretion analysis, the three methods gave results
reproducible to each other. Over-all evaluation therefore was such that
the method developed in the present study is as equally reliable as
previously developed methods. It should be further noted that the
procedures are very simple, with minimum use of occupationally or
environmentally hazardous chemicals. In case the determination of only
TCA is requested, it is possible to skip the hydrolysis step so that the
treatment prior to the GC analysis is even simpler, i.e., just a 60-fold
dilution of the urine sample with the EtOH-MeOH-water mixture. It was
also demonstrated that correction of urinary analyte levels for urine

	abstract = {{Common household water-use activities such as showering, bathing,
drinking, and washing clothes or dishes are potentially important
contributors to individual exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs), the major
class of disinfection by-products of water treated with chlorine.
Previous studies have focused on showering or bathing activities. In
this study, we selected 12 common water-use activities and determined
which may lead to the greatest THM exposures and result in the greatest
increase in the internal dose. Seven subjects performed the various
water-use activities in two residences served by water utilities with
relatively high and moderate total THM levels. To maintain a consistent
exposure environment, the activities, exposure times, air exchange
rates, water flows, water temperatures, and extraneous THM emissions to
the indoor air were carefully controlled. Water, indoor air, blood, and
exhaled-breath samples were collected during each exposure session for
each activity, in accordance with a strict, well-defined protocol.
Although showering (for 10 min) and bathing (for 14 min), as well as
machine washing of clothes and opening mechanical dishwashers at the end
of the cycle, resulted in substantial increases in indoor air chloroform
concentrations, only showering and bathing caused significant increases
in the breath chloroform levels. In the case of bromodichloromethane
(BDCM), only bathing yielded a significantly higher air level in
relation to the preexposure concentration. For chloroform from
showering, strong correlations were observed for indoor air and exhaled
breath, blood and exhaled breath, indoor air and blood, and tap water
and blood. Only water and breath, and blood and breath were
significantly associated for chloroform from bathing. For BDCM,
significant correlations were obtained for blood and air, and blood and
water from showering. Neither dibromochloromethane nor bromoform gave
measurable breath concentrations for any of the activities investigated
because of their much lower tap-water concentrations. Future studies
will address the effects that changes in these common water-use
activities may have on exposure.}},

	abstract = {{The aims of the present study were to characterize the subchronic
toxicity of chloroform by measuring tissue injury, repair, and
distribution of chloroform and to assess the reasons for the development
of tolerance to subchronic chloroform toxicity. Male Swiss Webster (SW)
mice were given three dose levels of chloroform (150, 225, and 300
mg/kg/day) by gavage in aqueous vehicle for 30 days. Liver and kidney
injury were measured by plasma ALT and BUN, respectively, and by
histopathology. Tissue regeneration was assessed by 3 H-thymidine
incorporation into hepato- and nephro-nuclear DNA and by proliferating
cell nuclear antigen staining. In addition, GSH and CYP2E1 in liver and
kidney were assessed at selected time points. The levels of chloroform
were measured in blood, liver, and kidney during the dosing regimen (1,
7, 14, and 30 days). Kidney injury was evident after I day with all
three doses and sustained until 7 days followed by complete recovery.
Mild to moderate liver injury was observed from I to 14 days with all
three dose levels followed by gradual decrease. Significantly higher
regenerative response was evident in liver and kidney at 7 days, but the
response was robust in kidney, preventing progression of injury beyond
first week of exposure. While the kidney regeneration reached basal
levels by 21 days, moderate liver regeneration with two higher doses
sustained through the end of the dosing regimen and 3 days after that.
Following repeated exposure for 7, 14, and 30 days, the blood and tissue
levels of chloroform were substantially lower with all three dose levels
compared to the levels observed with single exposure. Increased
exhalation of 14 C-chloroform after repeated exposures explains the
decreased chloroform levels in circulation and tissues. These results
suggest that toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (tissue regeneration)
contribute to the tolerance observed in SW mice to subchronic chloroform
toxicity. Neither bioactivation nor detoxification appears to play a
decisive role in the development of this tolerance. (c) 2006 Elsevier

	abstract = {{Water disinfection is extremely important for the protection of public
health; however, it also forms by-products, including trihatomethanes
(THMs). Previous studies of health effects from disinfection by-products
have lacked accurate methods to quantify exposure over time. As a first
step in establishing a better system for exposure assessment, the
authors investigated which household water use activities cause a
significant increase in internal dose concentrations of THMs. In this
study, 7 subjects in 2 different cities carried out 12 common activities
that involved water use. In 3 of these activities-bathing, showering,
and washing dishes by hand-the blood concentrations of THMs increased
substantially. Further analysis of the data suggested that tap water
concentrations primarily controlled the blood concentrations from
bathing exposure, whereas tap water concentrations and ambient air
concentrations resulting from water use affected the blood
concentrations from showering exposure. Further studies will focus on
variables in these activities that can alter exposure.}},

	abstract = {{Biomonitoring data provide evidence of human exposure to environmental
chemicals by quantifying the chemical or its metabolite in a biological
matrix. To better understand the correlation between biomonitoring data
and environmental exposure, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
modeling can be of use. The objective of this study was to use a
combined PBPK model with an exposure model for showering to estimate the
intake concentrations of chloroform based on measured blood and exhaled
breath concentrations of chloroform. First, the predictive ability of
the combined model was evaluated with three published studies describing
exhaled breath and blood concentrations in people exposed to chloroform
under controlled showering events. Following that, a plausible exposure
regimen was defined combining inhalation, ingestion, and dermal
exposures associated with residential use of water containing typical
concentrations of chloroform to simulate blood and exhaled breath
concentrations of chloroform. Simulation results showed that inhalation
and dermal exposure could contribute substantially to total chloroform
exposure. Next, sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis were
performed to investigate the sources of variability in model output. The
variability in exposure conditions (e. g., shower duration) was shown to
contribute more than the variability in pharmacokinetics (e. g., body
weight) to the predicted variability in blood and exhaled breath
concentrations of chloroform. Lastly, the model was used in a reverse
dosimetry approach to estimate distributions of exposure consistent with
concentrations of chloroform measured in human blood and exhaled breath.}},

decomposition. Using atmospheric pressure air as the carrier gas,
experimental results indicate that the maximum conversion of CH2Cl2 was
95.1\% at a total gas flow rate of 180 L/hr containing 1\% by volume of
CH2Cl2. The reaction occurred at an exothermic condition and gaseous
products are dominated by CO, CHCl3, and Cl-2. CO2 and CCl4 are also
detected in the product stream in small amounts. The conversion of
CH2Cl2 increases with the increasing applied voltage and decreasing

	abstract = {{Chloroform, ubiquitously present in indoor and outdoor air, drinking
water, and some foodstuffs, enters the human body by inhalation, oral
and dermal routes of exposure. In order to provide bioassay data for
risk assessment of humans exposed to chloroform by multiple routes,
effects of combined inhalation and oral exposures to chloroform on
carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity in male F344 rats were examined. A
group of 50 male rats was exposed by inhalation to 0 (clean air), 25,
50, or 100 ppm (v/v) of chloroform vapor-containing air for 6 h/d and 5
d/wk during a 104 w period, and each inhalation group was given
chloroform-formulated drinking water (1000 ppm w/w) or vehicle water for
104 wk, ad libitum. Renal-cell adenomas and carcinomas and atypical
renal-tubule hyperplasias were increased in the combined inhalation and
oral exposure groups, but not in the oral- or inhalation-alone groups.
Incidences of cytoplasmic basophilia and dilated tubular lumens in the
kidney, as well as incidence of positive urinary glucose, were markedly
increased by the combined exposures, compared with those after
single-route exposures. It was concluded that combined inhalation and
oral exposures markedly enhanced carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity in
the proximal tubule of male rat kidneys, suggesting that carcinogenic
and toxic effects of the combined exposures on the kidneys were greater
than the ones that would be expected under an assumption that the two
effects of single route exposures through inhalation and drinking were
additive.}},

@article{ISI:000241438900004,
	abstract = {{Generally, ingestion is the only route of exposure that is considered in
the risk assessment of drinking water contaminants. However, it is well
known that a number of these contaminants are volatile and lipophilic
and therefore highly susceptible to being absorbed through other routes,
mainly inhalation and dermal. The objective of this study was to develop
physiologically based human toxicokinetic (PBTK) models for
trihalomethanes (THM) and trichloroethylene (TCE) that will facilitate
(1) the estimation of internal exposure to these chemicals for various
multimedia indoor exposure scenarios, and (2) consideration of the
impact of biological variability in the estimation of internal doses.
Five PBTK models describing absorption through ingestion, inhalation and
skin were developed for these contaminants. Their concentrations in
ambient air were estimated from their respective tap water
concentrations and their physicochemical characteristics. Algebraic
descriptions of the physiological parameters, varying as a function of
age, gender and diverse anthropometric parameters, allow the prediction
of the influence of interindividual variations on absorbed dose and
internal dosimetry. Simulations for various scenarios were done for a
typical human (i.e., 70 kg, 1.7 m) as well as for humans of both genders
varying in age from 1 to 90 years. Simulations show that ingestion
contributes to less than 50\% of the total absorbed dose or metabolized
dose for all chemicals. This contribution to internal dosimetry, such as
maximal venous blood concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the venous
blood concentration time curve (AUC), decreases markedly (e.g., as low
as 0.9\% of Cmax for bromodichloromethane). The importance of this
contribution varies mainly as a function of shower duration. Moreover,
model simulations indicate that multimedia exposure is more elevated in
children than adults (i.e., up to 200\% of the adult internal dose). The
models developed in this study allow characterization of the influence
of the different routes of exposure and an improved estimation of the
realistic multimedia exposure to volatile organic chemicals present in
drinking water. Hence, such models will greatly improve health risk
assessment for these chemicals.}},

	abstract = {{Background: Among other methods, trichloroacetic acid precipitation is
used to quantify total protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Methods: We analyzed the influence of hemoglobin on total protein
concentration assayed by the trichloroacetic acid method and compared
the results to the benzethonium chloride method.
Results: Four CSF samples were spiked with different amounts of
hemoglobin, leading to overestimation of protein concentration when
assayed by the trichloroacetic acid method. Using the benzethonium
chloride method, measurement of protein concentration was minimally
disturbed. In addition, albumin and total protein concentrations were
measured in 135 clinical samples. The total protein/albumin ratio
remained constant when protein was measured with the benzethonium
chloride method, while ratios increased when protein was assayed by the
trichloroacetic acid method.
Conclusions: Strong interference by hemoglobin leads to overestimation
of the total protein concentration in CSF when assayed by the
trichloroacetic acid method and may lead to false conclusions when
evaluating the blood-brain barrier.}},

proposed based on the measurement of total internal reflected resonance
light scattering (TIR-RLS) at water/tetrachloromethane (H2O/CCl4)
interfaces. At pH 4.10 and in the presence of Cetyltrimethyl ammonium
bromide (CTAB), the interaction of Arsenazo-TB (ATB) with human serum
albumin (HSA) results in strong enhanced TIR-RLS signals with the
maximum spectra peak located at 330 nm. The enhanced TIR-RLS intensity
at 330 nm was found to be proportional to the concentration of HSA in
the range 0.5-42.3 mu g/ml and its limit of determination (3 sigma) is
198 ng/ml. The content of HSA in blood serum samples were determined
with the recovery of 97-103\% for standard addition experiment. (c) 2006

	abstract = {{The industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) and its major metabolites
have been shown to cause formic aciduria in male rats. We have examined
whether chloral hydrate (CH) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), known
metabolites of TCE, produce an increase in formic acid in vitro in
cultures of rat hepatocytes or human renal proximal tubule cells
(HRPTC). The metabolism and cytotoxicity of CH was also examined to
establish that the cells were metabolically active and not compromised
by toxicity. Rat hepatocytes and HRPTC were cultured in serum-free
medium and then treated with 0.3-3 mM CH for 3 days or 0.03-3 mM CH for
10 days, respectively and formic acid production, metabolism to
trichloroethanol (TCE-OH) and TCA and cytotoxicity determined. No
increase in formic acid production in rat hepatocytes or HRPTC exposed
to CH was observed over and above that due to chemical degradation,
neither was formic acid production observed in rat hepatocytes exposed
to TCA. HRPTC metabolized CH to TCE-OH and TCA with a 12-fold greater
capacity to form TCE-OH versus TCA. Rat hepatocytes exhibited a 1.6-fold
and three-fold greater capacity than HRPTC to form TCE-OH and TCA,
respectively. CH and TCA were not cytotoxic to rat hepatocytes at
concentrations up to 3 mM/day for 3 days. With HRPTC, one sample showed
no cytotoxicity to CH at concentrations up to 3 mM/day for 10 days,
while in another cytotoxicity was seen at 1 mM/day for 3 days. In
summary, increased formic acid production was not observed in rat
hepatocytes or HRPTC exposed to TCE metabolites, suggesting that the in
vivo response cannot be modelled in vitro. CH was toxic to HRPTC at
millimolar concentrations/day over 10 days, while glutathione derived
metabolites of WE were toxic at micromolar concentrations/day over 10
days {[}Lock, E.A., Reed, C.J., 2006. Trichloroethylene: mechanisms of

	abstract = {{Interfacial properties of N-nitrosodiethylamine/bovine serum albumin
(NDA/BSA) complexes were investigated at the air-water interface. The
interfacial behavior at the chloroform-water interface of the
interaction product of phospholipid
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), dissolved in the
chloroform phase, and NDA/BSA complex, in the aqueous phase, were also
analyzed by using a drop tensiometer. The secondary structure changes of
BSA with different NDA concentrations were monitored by circular
dichroism spectroscopy at different pH and the NDA/BSA interaction was
probed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Different NDA/BSA mixtures were
prepared from 0, 7.5 x 10(-5), 2.2 x 10(-4), 3.7 x 10(-4), 5 x 10(-4),
1.6 x 10(-3), and 3.1 x 10(-3) M NDA solutions in order to afford 0,
300/1, 900/1, 1 500/1, 2 000/1, 6 000/1, and 12 500/1 NDA/BSA molar
ratios, respectively, in the aqueous solutions. Increments of BSA
alpha-helix contents were obtained up to the 2 000/1 NDA/BSA molar
ratio, but at ratios beyond this value, the alpha-helix content
practically disappeared. These BSA structure changes produced an
increment of the surface pressure at the air-water interface, as the
alpha-helix content increased with the concentration of NDA. On the
contrary, when alpha-helix content decreased, the surface pressure also
appeared lower than the one obtained with pure BSA solutions. The
interaction of DPPC with NDA/BSA molecules at the chloroform-water
interface produced also a small, but measurable, pressure increment with
the addition of NDA molecules. Dynamic light scattering measurements of
the molecular sizes of NDA/BSA complex at pH 4.6, 7.1, and 8.4 indicated
that the size of extended BSA molecules at pH 4.6 increased in a greater
proportion with the increment in NDA concentration than at the other
studied pH values. Diffusion coefficients calculated from dynamic
surface tension values, using a short-term solution of the general
adsorption model of Ward and Tordai, also showed differences with pH and
the NDA concentration. Both, the storage and loss dilatational elastic
modulus were obtained at the air-water and at the chloroform-water
interfaces. The interaction of NDA/BSA with DPPC at the chloroform-water
produced a less rigid monolayer than the one obtained with pure DPPC (1
x 10(-5) M), indicating a significant penetration of NDA/BSA molecules
at the interface. At short times and pH 4.6, the values of the storage
elastic modulus were larger and more sensible to the NDA addition than
the ones at pH 7.1 and 8.4, probably due to a gel-like network formation
at the air-water interface.}},

	abstract = {{Plasma-assisted catalysis was used for the destruction of similar to 500
ppm of dichloromethane, CH2Cl2 (DCM), in gas streams of air using a
non-thermal, atmospheric pressure plasma utilising a dielectric packed
bed. The combination of plasma and catalyst gave improved destruction of
DCM. Eight catalysts which including alumina, TiO2 and various zeolites
were investigated with the finding that alumina in a one-stage reactor
configuration and TiO2 and HZSM-5 in two-stage configurations gave the
best DCM destructions. The sodium zeolites are capable of reducing by
similar to 50\% the unwanted NOx by-products, formed by plasma
processing in air. The nature of the catalyst is, important in terms of
the destruction efficiency, end-product selectivity and NOx reduction.

	abstract = {{A sensitive and straightforward method for the determination of
trihalomethanes (THMs) in urine by using headspace extraction technique
has been developed. Chemical and instrumental variables were studied in
order to optimize the method for sensitivity: an excess of KCl (4 g per
12 ml of urine). an oven temperature of 85 degrees C and an
equilibration time of 30 min were selected. The use of the mass
spectrometer in selected ion monitoring mode allows achieving linear
ranges between 10 and 5000 ng/l and detection limits from 3 to 10 ng/l,
for 12 ml of urine. The stability of the urine sample during storage at
4 and -20 degrees C was also evaluated: THMs remained stable for up to 2
days and 2 months, respectively. Finally, the method was successfully
applied to study the THM uptake from swimmers of an indoor swimming
pool, as well as non-swimmers. This study revealed that the
concentrations of THMs in urine increased approximately three times for
chloroform and bromodichloromethane after swimming activity. In
addition, THMs in unchanged form were mainly excreted within 2-3 h after
the end of exposure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{The analysis of volatile organic compounds in samples of biological
fluids characterized by complex matrices is highly challenging. This
paper presents a comparison of the results obtained in this field using
three solvent-free techniques: thin-layer headspace with autogenous
generation of liquid sorbent (TLHS) and membrane separation of the trace
substances (pervaporation, PV), both of which are coupled to direct
aqueous injection gas chromatography-electron capture detection
(TLHS-DAI-GC-ECD and PV-DAI-GC-ECD), as well as conventional static
headspace analysis followed by GC analysis with ECD detection
(HS-GC-ECD). Basic validation parameters of the HS-GC-ECD,
TLHS-DAI-GC-ECD and PV-DAI-GC-ECD procedures were calculated for water
and urine samples. The calibration curves for all procedures were linear
within the concentration range examined. The intermediate precisions of
the procedures were good and reached about 10\% (for all analytes) for
HS-GC-ECD and TLHS-DAI-GC-ECD. The poorest results were obtained for
PV-DAI-GC-ECD: about 20\% for all analytes. The lowest method detection
limits were obtained for the TLHS-DAI-GC-ECD procedure: below 0.0022 mu
g/L for all analytes. The enrichment factors did not differ
significantly between water and urine samples, indicating little or no
matrix effect in all procedures.}},

	abstract = {{Waste: all industrial productions generate wastes which must be
eliminated unless degrading the environment. In order to reduce the
waste volumes, CEA (the French Atomic Energy Agency) has developed and
patented a new process based upon the use of inductive plasma torch. The
process is specialized in degradation of liquid wastes, pure or in
mixture, such as organic or organic-halogen one. The goal of this
development was, to achieve a complete destruction of products but also
to control the atomic recombination in order to reject only non-toxic
off-gases. Demonstration of the relevance is presented here by
chloroform destruction capability. After presentation of the process,
experiments with chloroform are presented The global results are
discussed showing the good destruction efficiency and correct off gases
composition: the wastes have been completely destroyed, only CO2 and H2O
have been formed without any toxic compound or soot formation while the
chlorine is trapped by soda and transforms in mineral salt. The final
aim of this study is to develop a clean process for treatment of
radioactive organic halogen compounds. A small scale reactor is being
studied to prove the capability of the process for radioactive organic
halogen liquid waste destruction.}},

	abstract = {{A non-thermal. atmospheric pressure plasma utilising a dielectric packed
bed was used to study the destruction of dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, (DCM)
in gas streams of nitrogen with the presence of catalysts. The effect of
plasma-assisted catalysis was investigated in two configurations; one
where the catalyst was incorporated into the packed bed itself and the
other where the catalyst was downstream of the plasma. The combination
of plasma and a catalyst allowed improved destruction of DCM.
gamma-Al2O3 in a one-stage reactor configuration was the most successful
in terms of the total destruction of DCM as well as providing the best
result in the two-stage reactor configuration compared with the eight
catalysts chosen which included alumina. TiO2 and various zeolites.
Products as detected by FTIR were CO, CO2, HCN, HCl and H2O with the
by-product of N2O. The nature of the catalyst plays a vital role with
respect to the effectiveness of DCM destruction and the selectivity of
the end-products. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{Four groups (minimum of 10/dose group) of male Dutch-belted rabbits were
treated daily with dibromoacetic acid (DBA) via drinking water beginning
in utero from gestation day 15 to adulthood; target dosages were 1, 5,
and 50 mg DBA/kg body weight. Developmental, prepubertal as well as
postpubertal reproductive sequelae were evaluated. One (out of 22), 2
(out of 32), and 1 (out of 21) male offspring in the 1, 5, and 50 mg
DBA/kg groups were unilaterally cryptorchid. There were no significant
differences in serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,
and testosterone (basal concentrations or in response to exogenous
gonadotropin-releasing hormone) in both prepubertal and adult rabbits.
Chronic exposure to DBA adversely affected the mating abilities of some
rabbits. The number of sperm produced was not affected, but
spermiogenesis was disrupted, resulting in unique sperm
acrosomal-nuclear malformations even at the 1-mg dose level.
Concentrations of SP22, a specific sperm membrane fertility protein, in
detergent extracts of ejaculated sperm were significantly lower (P <.05)
in all DBA-treated groups compared with controls. The conception rates
following artificial insemination of a constant number of sperm for 1,
5, and 50 mg DBA/kg groups were 55\% (10/18), 65\% (13/20), and 55\%
(9/16), respectively, vs 85\% (17/20) for control group. Histologic
lesions in testes characterized by spermatogenic arrest predominantly at
the round spermatid stage, pyknosis of differentiating germ cells, and
ultimate degeneration and clesquamation leaving focal vacuolation in
seminiferous epithelium were evident in DBA-treated groups. Thus, male
rabbits exhibit reproductive toxicity with exposure to DBA during
reproductive development at dosages as low as 1 mg/kg body weight.}},

	abstract = {{Exposure to bromodichloromethane (BDCM), one of the most prevalent
disinfection byproducts in drinking water, can occur via ingestion of
water and by dermal absorption and inhalation during activities such as
bathing and showering. The objectives of this research were to assess
BDCM pharmacokinetics in human volunteers exposed percutaneously and
orally to (13)C-BDCM and to evaluate factors that could affect
disposition of BDCM. Among study subjects, CYP2E1 activity varied
fourfold; 20\% had the glutathione S-transferase theta 1-1 homozygous
null genotype; and body fat ranged from 7 to 22\%. Subjects were exposed
to (13)C-BDCM in water (target concentration of 36 mu g/l) via ingestion
and by forearm submersion. Blood was collected for up to 24 h and
analyzed for (13)C-BDCM by solid-phase microextraction and
high-resolution GC-MS. Urine was collected before and after exposure for
mutagenicity determinations in Salmonella. After ingestion (mean dose 5
146 ng/kg), blood (13)C-BDCM concentrations peaked and declined rapidly,
returning to levels near or below the limit of detection (LOD) within 4
h. The T(max) for the oral exposure ranged from 5 to 30 min, and the
C(max) ranged from 0.4 to 4.1 ng/l. After the 1 h dermal exposure
(estimated mean dose 5 155 ng/kg), blood concentrations of (13)C-BDCM
ranged from 39 to 170 ng/l and decreased to levels near or below the LOD
by 24 h. Peak postdose urine mutagenicity levels that were at least
twice that of the predose mean level occurred in 6 of 10 percutaneously
exposed subjects and 3 of 8 orally exposed subjects. These results
demonstrate a highly significant contribution of dermal absorption to
circulating levels of BDCM and confirm the much lower oral contribution,
indicating that water uses involving dermal contact can lead to much
greater systemic BDCM doses than water ingestion. These data will
facilitate development and validation of physiologically based
pharmacokinetic models for BDCM in humans.}},

	abstract = {{Dihaloalkanes are of toxicological interest because of their high-volume
use in industry and their abilities to cause tumors in rodents,
particularly dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. The brominated
analogues are not used as extensively but are known to produce more
toxicity in some systems. Rats and mice were treated i.p. with
C-14-dichloromethane, -dibromomethane, -1,2-dichloroethane, or
-1,2-dibromoethane {[}5mg (kg body weight)(-1)], and livers and kidneys
were collected to rapidly isolate DNA. The DNA was digested using a
procedure designed to minimize processing time, because some of the
potential dihalomethane-derived DNA-glutathione (GSH) adducts are known
to be unstable, and the HPLC fractions corresponding to major adduct
standards were separated and analyzed for C-14 using accelerator mass
spectrometry. The level of liver or kidney S-{[}2-(N-7-guanyl)ethyl]GSH
in rats treated with 1,2-dibromoethane was similar to 1 adduct/10(5) DNA
bases; in male or female mice, the level was approximately one-half of
this. The levels of 1,2-dichloroethane adducts were 10-50-fold lower.
None of four known (in vitro) GSH-DNA adducts was detected at a level of
> 2/10(8) DNA bases from dibromomethane or dichloromethane. These
results provide parameters for risk assessment of these compounds: DNA
binding occurs with 1,2-dichloroethane but is considerably less than
from 1,2-dibromoethane in vivo, and low exposure to dihalomethanes does
not produce appreciable DNA adduct levels in rat or mouse liver and
kidney of the doses used. The results may be used to address issues in
human risk assessment.}},

	abstract = {{This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of two
traditionally used Turkish medicinal plants, Camellia sinensis (CS) and
Urtica dioica L. (UD), beverages used against chemical carcinogen
trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-exposure in rats. The preventive potential of
the plant infusions was evaluated by measuring the level of serum marker
enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); antioxidant defense
systems, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase
(CAT); and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) content in various
organs of rats. Twenty four healthy rats were randomly allotted into
four experimental groups: A (untreated control), B (only TCA-treated), C
(TCA + CS treated) and D (TCA + UD treated). At the end of the 50 days,
the plant infusions possessed chemoprotective effects, deduced by the
remaining TCA-induced increased serum damage marker enzyme, lipid
peroxidation and antioxidative system in rats compared with those of the
control and TCA-exposed rats. According to the results, while the levels
of AST, ALT and CPK increased in group B, no significant changes were
observed in groups C and D. The MDA content slightly increased in
tissues of all groups, being higher in group B. Antioxidant enzyme
activities such as SOD and CAT increased significantly in the brain,
liver and kidney of group B while they did not change significantly
except for in the kidney in groups C and D. The GSH level and the
ancillary enzyme GR activity did not change significantly in organs of
all groups. On the other hand, the drug metabolizing enzyme, GST,
activity decreased significantly in the brain, liver and kidney of group
D while slight changes were observed for the other groups. The results
revealed that TCA exposure induced oxidative stress in rat tissues,
however, in plant beverage supplemented groups, a significant protective
effect of CS and UD against TCA-induced oxidative injury was recorded.
Hence, the study revealed that the constituents present in CS and UD
impart protection against carcinogenic chemical induced oxidative injury
that may result in the development of cancer. Also the observations,
along with changes, suggest that both CS and UD may possess preventive
potential during a 50-day protective exposure. Copyright (c) 2007 John

	abstract = {{A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization
tandem mass spectrometric (LC/ESI-MS/MS) method has been developed for
the quantification of bioactive peptides in biological fluids. The
method employs protein precipitation with 4\% trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using an immonium ion as the
product ion. This method was applied to determine the synthetic
parathyroid hormone (PTH) analog (MW 1721) in rat plasma and human
hepcidin-25 (MW 2789) in human serum. TCA clean-up showed a sufficient
recovery for peptides with a MW of less than 3000, and would be useful
as a simple and rapid method because of direct injection of the
supernatant without evaporation or dilution. In addition, TCA clean-up
allowed us not only to reduce sample preparation time, but also to
select an immonium ion as a product ion of SRM, which led to detection
more sensitive than SRM using other types of product ions. The lower
limits of quantitation (LLOQs) of the PTH analog and the human
hepcidin-25 were 0.2 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, respectively. This method was
fully validated with acceptable linearity, intra- and inter-assay
precisions, and accuracy. Furthermore, this simple and rapid method is
applicable to pharma-cokinetic studies. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \&

@article{ISI:000252142100025,
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND: We previously conducted a study to assess whether household
exposures to tap water increased an individual's internal dose of
trihalomethanes (THMs). Increases in blood THM levels among subjects who
showered or bathed were variable, with increased levels tending to
cluster in two groups.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to assess the importance of personal
characteristics, previous exposures, genetic polymorphisms, and
environmental exposures in determining THM concentrations in blood after
showering.
METHODS: One hundred study participants completed a health symptom
questionnaire, a 48-hr food and water consumption diary, and took a
10-min shower in a controlled setting. We examined THM levels in blood
samples collected at baseline and 10 and 30 min after the shower. We
assessed the significance of personal characteristics, previous
exposures to THMs, and specific gene polymorphisms in predicting
postshower blood THM concentrations.
RESULTS: We did not observe the clustering of blood THM concentrations
observed in our earlier study. We found that environmental THM
concentrations were important predictors of blood THM concentrations
immediately after showering. For example, the chloroform concentration
in the shower stall air was the most important predictor of blood
chloroform levels 10 min after the shower (p < 0.001). Personal
characteristics, previous exposures to THMs, and specific polymorphisms
in CYP2D6 and GSTT1 genes were significant predictors of both baseline
and postshowering blood THM concentrations as well as of changes in THM
concentrations associated with showering.
CONCLUSION: The inclusion of information about individual physiologic
characteristics and environmental measurements would be valuable in
future studies to assess human health effects from exposures to THMs in
tap water.}},

	abstract = {{Today's world is increasingly seeking ways to replace the synthetic
drugs with the therapeutic power of natural products. This study was
designed to investigate the protective effects of Foeniculum vulgare
(FV) and Salvia officinalis (SO) waters infusions against carcinogen
chemical trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-exposure in rats. The
chemopreventive potential of the plant infusions were evaluated by
measuring levels of serum marker enzymes {[}aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), acid
phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH)], antioxidant defense systems {[}Reduced glutathione (GSH),
glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT)] and lipid
peroxidation level (Malondialdehyde = MDA) in various tissues of rats.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 150-200 g, were randomly allotted
into four experimental groups. While the control group (A) received only
natural spring water, the treatment B group (0.2\% TCA) supplied with
the drinking water containing 0.2\% TCA, the treatment C (TCA + FV
infusion) and D (TCA + SO infusion) groups drank the drinking water
containing 0.2\% TCA and 2.5\% the plant grains and leaves ad libitum
for 50 days during experiment. At the end of the 50 days experiment, TCA
and the plant's infusions caused different affect on the serum marker
enzymes, tissues antioxidant defense systems and lipid peroxidation
against TCA-exposed in rats with comparison to those of TCA exposed and
control rats. According to the results, both TCA and TCA + plants
infusions caused a significant increase in serum AST, ALT and CPK
activity. Non-enzymic antioxidant GSH level significantly increased in
the brain whereas reduced in the erythrocytes and kidney of TCA + FV and
TCA + SO as compared to TCA group and control. While MDA content
slightly increased in tissues of TCA group in comparison to those of
control, significantly decreased in the brain, liver and kidney of rats
of TCA + FV and TCA + SO groups as compared to TCA group and control.
Antioxidative enzyme activity such as CAT and SOD significantly
increased in the brain, liver and kidney tissues of TCA induced group
whereas reduced the same enzymes activities as compared to TCA group.
The ancillary enzyme GR activity significantly depleted in the brain and
kidney of TCA + FV and TCA + SO groups in comparison to those of TCA
exposed and control rats. In addition, the drug metabolizing enzyme GST
activity significantly declined in the brain and kidney of TCA + FV and
TCA + SO groups in comparison to those of TCA exposed and control rats,
whereas, also reduced in the liver of TCA + FV and TCA + SO groups in
comparison to those of TCA exposed rats. It was concluded that the
levels of serum marker enzymes were found not to be decreased in plants
treated groups due to hepatic damage induced by TCA. Also the four
antioxidant enzymes were found to be activated in different degrees
following TCA treatment and declined the activation of the enzymes the
plant infusions accompanied by significant reduction in MDA
concentration in the tissues. The observations, along with changes,
might suggest that the both FV and SO may possess antioxidant properties
during the period of a 50-day protective exposure.}},

	abstract = {{The concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble copper and
caeruloplasmin were determined in 345 serum samples taken from cattle in
March 1998 by eight Scottish Agricultural College veterinary disease
surveillance centres serving areas with soils ranging from being'high'
in molybdenum (Thurso) to `low' (Perth and St Boswells). The mean
concentrations varied significantly between the centres, with Thurso
having the lowest values for both variables. There were strong linear
regressions (r > 0.8) between caeruloplasmin and TCA-soluble copper for
each centre but no significant differences in slope or intercept between
the areas with the highest and lowest soil molybdenum, and the pooled
regression accounted for 88 per cent of the variation. The distribution
of the ratios of caeruloplasmin to TCA-soluble copper, unlike those of
the individual variables, was not normal, and 70 per cent of the values
fell within 10 per cent of the mean ratio of 20-3 mg/mu mol and close to
the 22 mg/mu mol copper expected in pure caeruloplasmin. Low ratios were
generally associated with low TcA-soluble copper. Ratios above 24 were
found in 8 per cent of the samples and were probably attributable to
acute-phase reactions and the non-specificity of the assay for
caeruloplasmin.}},

	abstract = {{Background: The use of chlorine for water disinfection results in the
formation of numerous contaminants called disinfection by-products
(DBPs), which may be associated with birth defects, including urinary
tract defects.
Methods: We used Arkansas birth records (1998-2002) to conduct a
population-based case-control study investigating the relationship
between hypospadias and two classes of DBPs, trihalomethanes (THM) and
haloacetic acids (HAA). We utilised monitoring data, spline regression
and geographical information systems (GIS) to link daily concentrations
of these DBPs from 263 water utilities to 320 cases and 614 controls. We
calculated ORs for hypospadias and exposure to DBPs between 6 and 16
weeks' gestation, and conducted subset analyses for exposure from
ingestion, and metrics incorporating consumption, showering and bathing.
Results: We found no increase in risk when women in the highest tertiles
of exposure were compared to those in the lowest for any DBP. When
ingestion alone was used to assess exposure among a subset of 40 cases
and 243 controls, the intermediate tertiles of exposure to total THM and
the five most common HAA had ORs of 2.11 (95\% CI 0.89 to 5.00) and 2.45
(95\% CI 1.06 to 5.67), respectively, compared to women with no
exposure. When exposure to total THM from consumption, showering and
bathing exposures was evaluated, we found an OR of 1.96 (95\% CI 0.65 to
6.42) for the highest tertiles of exposure and weak evidence of a
dose-response relationship.
Conclusions: Our results provide little evidence for a positive
relationship between DBP exposure during gestation and an increased risk
of hypospadias but emphasise the necessity of including individual-level
data when assessing exposure to DBPs.}},

	abstract = {{Objective-To assess the risk of bladder cancer in dogs from exposure to
drinking water disinfection by-products and determine whether dogs could
serve as sentinels for human bladder cancer associated with such
exposures.
Design-Case-control study.
Animals-100 dogs with cancer of the urinary bladder and 100 control dogs
Procedures-Case and control dogs were frequency-matched by age (within 2
years) and sex. Owners of dogs enrolled provided verbal informed consent
and were interviewed by telephone. The telephone questionnaire included
a complete residence history for each dog. Each dog's total exposure
history to trilhalomethanes was reconstructed from its residence history
and corresponding drinking water utility company data.
Results-No association was detected between increasing years of exposure
to chlorinated drinking water and risk of bladder cancer. Dogs with
bladder cancer were exposed to higher total trihalomethanes
concentrations than control dogs; however, the difference was not
significant.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Although humans and their dogs live
in the same household, the activity patterns of dogs may lead to lower
exposures to household tap water. Thus, although exposure to
disinfection by-products in tap water may be a risk factor for human
bladder cancer, this may not be true for canine bladder cancer at the
concentrations at which dogs are exposed.}},

	abstract = {{The exposure of workers and swimmers at an indoor swimming pool to
trihalomethanes (THMs) as a consequence of water chlorination was
evaluated by analyzing alveolar air and urine samples. Environmental
monitoring of THMs in water and ambient air was also performed in order
to assess the possible correlation between environmental and biological
samples. The sampling was done concurrently, taking the urine and
alveolar air samples before and after the work shift for 15 workers and
the swimming activity for 12 swimmers. A high THM uptake was observed in
alveolar air and urine of subjects exposed, with chloroform being the
most abundant THM. Mean chloroform levels in alveolar air and urine
before exposure were 4 mu g/ m(3) and 475 ng/L, respectively. After 2 h
of exposure, concentration increases of ca. 8 times in alveolar air and
2 times in urine were observed in workers. After 1 h swimming, the
increases found in swimmers were ca. 20 and 3 times in alveolar air and
urine, respectively. High increases have also been observed in
bromodichloromethane levels. We have obtained excellent correlations
between the chloroform concentrations found in the swimming pool ambient
air/alveolar air, and between the urine/ alveolar air of the
participants after exposure (r > 0.9). In conclusion, alveolar air
provides better response sensitivity and shorter reaction time to
external exposure than urine, being therefore the most sensitive
biomarker.}},

(trichloromethane) using different types of nonthermal plasma reactors.
Three reactors, i.e., a surface discharge reactor, a dielectric-packed
bed reactor and a barrier discharge reactor with a perforated dielectric
tube, were compared with respected to the trichloromethane destruction
efficiency. The effect of oxygen content and input power on the
trichloromethane destruction was examined, and the byproducts were
analyzed to elucidate the destruction pathways. The dielectric-packed
bed reactor was found to show better performance in the trichloromethane
destruction than the other two reactors. The increase in the oxygen
content decreased the destruction efficiency, and the highest
destruction efficiency was obtained at oxygen content 0.5\%. The
calculations for electron-molecule collisions indicated that the most
abundant reactive species initiating the destruction of trichloromethane
are metastable nitrogen molecules. The major byproducts were CO and
Cl(2), and the formations of NO(2) and N(2)O were also significant.}},

bilirubin (BR) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the interface between a
heptane phase (including CHCl(3)) and an aqueous phase was investigated
by means of the absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies
combined with a centrifugal liquid membrane (CLM) method, and a CLIVI
microscopic fluorescence spectroscopy as well. The observed absorption,
CID and fluorescence spectra disclosed the interfacial complexation
process of BR with BSA for the first time, suggesting further
aggregation of the BR-BSA complex at the interface. It was noticed more
that, due to the formation of the chiral aggregates of BR-BSA complex,
the interfacial CID signal of M(-) conformation of BR was appeared
gradually. However, higher content of CHCl(3) in the organic phase,
resulting in the increase in fluorescence intensity, evidently affected
the formation of the aggregates of the complex at the interface. The
addition of extra CHCl(3) to the interfacial aggregates induced temporal
inversion of CID sign of BR, which should be caused by the local
structural change of BSA brought about by the specific solvation of
CHCl(3). (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

properties of Punica granatum (PG) beverage against trichloroacetic acid
(TCA)-exposure in rats. The hepatopreventive and antioxidant potential
of the plant's infusion was evaluated by measuring level of serum
enzymes, antioxidant defense systems (ADS) and lipid peroxidation
content in various organs of rats. Three experimental groups: A
(untreated = control), B (only TCA-treated) and C (TCA+PG treated).
According to the results, while the levels of AST and ALT increased
significantly in B groups' they decreased significantly in the C
groups'. LDH and CK did not change significantly in B groups' whereas
decreased significantly in the C groups'. Liver, brain, kidney and heart
tissues MDA content significantly increased in B groups', whereas no
significant changes were observed in the C groups'. On the other hand,
SOD decreased significantly in liver of the B group but did not change
significantly in the C groups'. GST activity increased significantly in
liver, brain and spleen of C group while significant decrease was
observed for kidney as compared to those of control. Hence, the study
reveals that constituents present in PG impart protection against
carcinogenic chemical induced oxidative injury that may result in
development of cancer during the period of a 52-day protective exposure.

	abstract = {{Perchloroethylene (perc), a solvent used in dry cleaning operations and
industrial applications. has been found to produce increases in
hepatocellular carcinomas and/or adenomas in mice in chronic inhalation
bioassays. Perc is metabolized primarily to trichloroacetic acid (TCA),
which is also a mouse hepatocarcinogen. The fractional conversion of
perchloroethylene to TCA by mice was determined from physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of TCA in mouse blood at the
conclusion of inhalation exposure of male and female B6C3F1 mice to 10,
50, 100, or 200 ppm perc for 6 h/day for 5 days. The dose-dependent
bioavailability of TCA in B6C3F1 mice exposed to TCA in drinking water
was estimated by optimizing the fit of time course blood, plasma, and
liver TCA concentrations for TCA doses ranging from 12 to 800 mg/(kg
day) to predictions of a previously published TCA PBPK model. Using the
PBPK models, the area under the liver TCA concentration vs. time curve
(liver TCA AUC) was calculated for TCA and perc bioassays. Benchmark
dose analyses were conducted to determine the dose-response relationship
between liver TCA AUC and the additional risk of hepatocellular adenomas
or carcinomas (combined) in mice ingesting TCA. Using the dose-response
relationships derived for the TCA-exposed mice, the contribution of TCA
produced by metabolism to the additional risk of liver adenomas and
carcinomas in mice exposed to perchloroethylene by inhalation was
computed. The analysis indicated that the levels of TCA observed in
perchloroethylene-exposed mice are sufficient to explain the incidence
of liver adenomas and carcinomas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

considerably when cold water stagnates in residential pipes and, more
significantly, when water remains in the hot water tank. Levels of
haloacetic acids (HAAs) increase as well in both cases, but less
significantly in comparison to THMs. The study also demonstrates that in
both the plumbing system and residential hot water tank, chlorinated and
brominated DBP species do not behave in the same manner. Finally, the
study shows that sustained use of water in households helps to maintain
THM and HAA levels close to those found in water of the distribution
system. The results are useful to identify methods of indoor water use
that minimize population exposure to DBPs and improve DBP exposure
assessment for epidemiological studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

in nonthermal plasma was investigated with a ferroelectric packed-bed
reactor. The decomposition efficiencies of 109 ppm CH(2)Cl(2) and 100

decomposition of CH(2)Cl(2) and toluene, CO(2) selectivity increased
with O(2) content. The higher the CO(x) yield, the lower the CO(2)
selectivity. In N(2), cyanides were detected as byproducts from
CH(2)Cl(2) and toluene, organic chlorides from CH(2)Cl(2), and benzene
from toluene. However, no mixing effect was observed in the byproduct
formation. The number and amounts of the byproducts decreased with an
increase of O(2) content in the background gas. In the presence of O(2),
formic acid was transiently formed from CH(2)Cl(2), but its amount
decreased with the increase in reactor energy density. No
oxygen-containing byproducts were newly detected.}},

health issue and a challenge for epidemiology to provide evidence
towards the causation of various hypothesized health effects. Validation
of a biomarker of exposure to DBPs is a strategy to achieve progress
which has been advocated. The objective of this study was to validate
urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) excretion as a biomarker of exposure
to DBPs in an experimental exposure cohort. A total of 52 healthy women
participated in the study. Participants consumed supplied tap water for
15 d and provided urine and blood samples for TCAA measurements. The
findings revealed that (1) background levels of TCAA in urine and blood
were readily detectable, (2) TCAA levels in blood and urine increased
with increased amounts of TCAA ingested, (3) the correlations between
measurements of TCAA ingestion and urinary excretion were modest (r =
0.66, p < 0.001) based on one days' sampling and high (r = 0.77-0.83, p,
0.001) based on two to four days' sampling, (4) the correlations between
measurements of TCAA ingestion and blood TCAA concentration were high (r
= 0.80, p < 0.001) and (5) multiple days' urinary TCAA measures improved
the prediction of TCAA ingestion through urinary TCAA excretion. TCAA
can be a valid biomarker of exposure for DBPs in drinking water.}},

	abstract = {{This study was designed to analyse the reliability of using urinary and
blood trichloroacetic acid ( TCAA) as a biomarker of exposure. A total
of 46 healthy women consumed supplied TCAA-containing tap water for 15
days and provided urine and blood samples for TCAA measurements. The
findings revealed that the reliability of measurements was excellent by
using measures of TCAA ingestion, blood concentration and urinary
excretion (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)>0.75, p<0.001).
Volume of tap water con sumption (ICC=0.69) and creatinine-adjusted
urinary concentration (ICC=0.72) were less reliable. This indicated that
the intraindividual variability was small and the interindividual
reliability was high by using these measures in this cohort study.
Laboratory variability did not significantly contribute to total
variance (ICC>0.95, p<0.001). Other possible sources of variation such
as bathing, showering, dishwashing and physical activities were unlikely
to contribute signicantly to total variance. For sampling strategies,
1-day blood sampling and 2-day urine sampling are sufficient to achieve
reliability for an epidemiological study if a quasi-steady-state TCAA
level in the body is reached. The results suggest that TCAA ingestion,
TCAA loading in blood and urinary TCAA excretion are reliable measures
for use as biomarkers in epidemiological studies.}},

	abstract = {{Background: A new microextraction method named dispersive liquid-liquid
microextraction (DLLME) for determination of chloroform in pool water
and blood of swimmers after swimming is described.
Methods: This method was performed based on coupling dispersive
liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) with gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS). Methanol and trichloroethylenes were used as the
disperser solvent and the extraction solvents, respectively. The volumes
of these solvents were optimized for pool water by central composite
design. The study involved three indoor swimming pools and nine
swimmers.
Results: Chloroform concentration of pool water was 118-135 mu g L(-1)
and of blood ranged from 1.26 to 1.66 mu g L(-1).
Conclusion: Indoor swimming pools are closed environments presenting
detectable levels of trihalomethanes (THMs). Chloroform (CHCl(3)) is the
most represented THMs. Therefore, the presence of CHCl(3) may be
considered representative of the THMs. The new method DLLME was applied
for determination of CHCl(3) in pool water and blood of swimmers after
swimming inside the indoor swimming pool. The method was optimized by
experimental design. Chloroform concentrations in the specified pool
waters were 135, 124, 118 mu g L(-1).}},

@article{ISI:000276705400005,
	abstract = {{Dichloromethane (DCM, methylene chloride) is a lipophilic volatile
compound readily absorbed and then metabolized to several metabolites
that may lead to chronic toxicity in different target organs.
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are useful tools for
calculation of internal and target organ doses of parent compound and
metabolites. PBPK models, coupled with in vivo inhalation gas-uptake
data, can be useful to estimate total metabolism. Previously, such an
approach was used to make predictions regarding the metabolism and to
make subsequent inferences of DCM's mode of action for toxicity.
However, current evidence warrants re-examination of this approach. The
goal of this work was to examine two different hypotheses for DCM
metabolism in mice. One hypothesis describes two metabolic pathways: one
involving cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and a second glutathione (GSH).
The second metabolic hypothesis describes only one pathway mediated by
CYP2E1 that includes multiple binding sites. The results of our analysis
show that the in vivo gas-uptake data fit both hypotheses well and the
traditional analysis of the chamber concentration data is not sufficient
to distinguish between them. Gas-uptake data were re-analyzed by
construction of a velocity plot as a function of increasing DCM initial
concentration. The velocity (slope) analysis revealed that there are two
substantially different phases in velocity, one rate for lower exposures
and a different rate for higher exposures. The concept of a ``metabolic
switch,{''} namely that due to conformational changes in the enzyme
after one site is occupied - a different metabolic rate is seen - is
also consistent with the experimental data. Our analyses raise questions
concerning the importance of GSH metabolism for DCM. Recent research
results also question the importance of this pathway in the toxicity of
DCM. GSH-related DNA adducts were not formed after in vivo DCM exposure
in mice and DCM-induced DNA damage has been detected in human lung
cultures without GSH metabolism. In summary, a revised/updated metabolic
hypothesis for DCM has been examined using in vivo inhalation data in
mice combined with PBPK modeling that is consistent with up-to-date
models of the active site for CYP2E1 and suggests that this pathway is
the major metabolizing pathway for DCM metabolism. Published by Elsevier

	abstract = {{Trihalomethanes (THMs) can form as byproducts during drinking water
disinfection, which is crucial for limiting human exposure to
disease-causing pathogens. The US Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA), recognizing both the importance of water disinfection for
public health protection and potential risks associated with THM
exposure, developed disinfection byproduct rules with the parallel goals
of ensuring safe drinking water and limiting the levels of THMs in
public water systems. The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) THM blood data can be used as a means for assessing US
population exposures to THMs; biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) can
provide human health risk-based context to those data. In this paper, we
examine the blood THM levels in the 1999-2004 NHANES data to (i)
determine weighted population percentiles of blood THMs, (ii) explore
whether gender and/or age are associated with blood THM levels, (iii)
determine whether temporal trends can be discerned over the 6-year
timeframe, and (iv) draw comparisons between population THM blood levels
and BEs. A statistically significant decrease in blood chloroform levels
was observed across the 1999-2004 time period. Age-related differences
in blood chloroform levels were not consistent and no gender-related
differences in blood chloroform levels were observed. The concentrations
of all four THMs in the blood of US residents from the 2003 to 2004
NHANES dataset are below BEs consistent with the current US EPA
reference doses. For bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane, the
measured median blood concentrations in the United States are within the
BEs for the 10(-6) and 10(-4) cancer risk range, whereas measured values
for bromoform generally fall below the 10(-6) cancer risk range. These
assessments indicate that general population blood concentrations of
THMs are in a range considered to be a low to medium priority for risk
assessment follow-up, according to the guidelines for interpretation of
biomonitoring data using BEs. Journal of Exposure Science and

	abstract = {{Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), a product of hepatic metabolism of the widely
used anticancer drug ifosfamide (IFO), has been reported to decrease
cancer cell proliferation. The basis of this effect is not completely
known but has been attributed to a drop of cellular ATP content. Given
the importance of glucose metabolism and of the `Warburg effect' in
cancer cells, we examined in the present study the ability of CAA to
inhibit cancer cell proliferation by altering the glycolytic pathway.
Cell proliferation, ATP content, glucose transport and metabolism as
well as the activities of the main enzymes of glycolysis were determined
in human breast cancer cells MCF-7 in the presence of various CAA
concentrations (5-50 mu M). Our results show that low CAA concentrations
inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. This
inhibition was explained by a decrease in glucose utilization. Cellular
ATP content was not reduced but even increased with 25 mu M CAA. The
inhibition of glucose metabolism was mainly explained by the decrease in
glucose transport and hexokinase activity. The activity of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, but not that of
phosphofructokinase, was also inhibited. Glycolysis inhibition by CAA
was effective in decreasing the proliferation of MCF-7 cells.
Interestingly, this decrease was not due to ATP depletion; rather, it
was linked to a drop of biosynthetic precursors from glycolytic
intermediates. This CAA-induced inhibition of cell proliferation
suggests that it might play a role in the antitumor activity of IFO.

	abstract = {{A Bayesian hierarchical model was developed to estimate the parameters
in a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for chloroform
using prior information and biomarker data from different exposure
pathways. In particular, the model provides a quantitative description
of the changes in physiological parameters associated with hot-water
bath and showering scenarios. Through Bayesian inference, uncertainties
in the PBPK parameters were reduced from the prior distributions.
Prediction of biomarker data with the calibrated PBPK model was improved
by the calibration. The posterior results indicate that blood flow rates
varied under two different exposure scenarios, with a two-fold increase
of the skin's blood flow rate predicted in the hot-bath scenario. This
result highlights the importance of considering scenario-specific
parameters in PBPK modeling. To demonstrate the application of a
probability approach in toxicological assessment, results from the
posterior distributions from this calibrated model were used to predict
target tissue dose based on the rate of chloroform metabolized in liver.
This study demonstrates the use of the Bayesian approach to optimize
PBPK model parameters for typical household exposure scenarios. Journal

here in. The calixarene thin film is fabricated for the first time by
plasma polymerized technique. Each experiment carried out at room
temperature, at 0.6 mbar operating pressure, 2.0 kV DC and 19 kV pulsed
voltages. From the UV-vis spectra it is observed that the polyconjugated
structure is established and the thin films highly possess the
characteristic bands of the oligomer. The SPR results revealed that the
films thickness is at the order of several nm and the refractive index
range from 2.2 to 2.8. The QCM results show that the thin films are
highly sensitive with a fast and reversible adsorption to chloroform.
The typical response time was of a few seconds.}},

@article{ISI:000279509300015,
	abstract = {{Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are water disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed
by the reaction of chlorine oxidizing compounds with natural organic
matter in water containing bromine. HAAs are second to trihalomethanes
as the most commonly detected DBPs in surface drinking water and
swimming pools. After oral exposure (drinking, showering, bathing and
swimming), HAAs are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and
excreted in urine. Typical methods used to determine these compounds in
urine (mainly from rodents) only deal with one or two HAAs and their
sensitivity is inadequate to determine HAA levels in human urine, even
those manual sample preparation protocols which are complex, costly, and
neither handy nor amenable to automation. In the present communication,
we report on a sensitive and straightforward method to determine the
nine HAAs in human urine using static headspace (HS) coupled with GC-MS.
Important parameters controlling derivatisation and HS extraction were
optimised to obtain the highest sensitivity: 120 mu l of
dimethylsulphate and 100 mu l of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate
(derivatisation regents) were selected, along with an excess of
Na(2)SO(4) (6 g per 12 ml of urine), an oven temperature of 70 degrees C
and an equilibration time of 20 min. The method developed renders an
efficient tool for the precise and sensitive determination of the nine
HAAs in human urine (RSDs ranging from 6 to 11\%, whereas LODs ranged
from 0.01 to 0.1 mu g/l). The method was applied in the determination of
HAAs in urine from swimmers in an indoor swimming pool, as well as in
that of non-swimmers. HAAs were not detected in the urine samples from
non-swimmers and those of volunteers before their swims; therefore, the
concentrations found after exposure were directly related to the
swimming activity. The amounts of MCAA. DCAA and TCAA excreted from all
swimmers are related to the highest levels in the swimming pool water.

and accumulation of chloroform in the blood, liver, kidney and abdominal
fat of rats after simultaneous exposure by two routes, inhalation and
oral. To distinguish the contribution of each route, unmodified
chloroform (CHCl3) was administered by inhalation and deuterated
chloroform (CDCl3) was administered orally. Exposure by inhalation and
oral administration resulted in CHCl3 and CDCl3 concentrations in the
tissues which were significantly higher than when exposure was by either
inhalation or oral administration alone. This is the first study to
follow the contribution of each of two routes of chloroform exposure on
chloroform distribution and accumulation in target tissues. Our results
indicate that when assessing the toxicity and carcinogenicity of
chloroform, exposure routes, especially the effects of exposure by
multiple routes, must be taken into consideration.}},

@article{ISI:000283711800022,
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking
water has been associated with cancer risk. A recent study (Villanueva
et al. 2007; Am J Epidemiol 165:148-156) found an increased bladder
cancer risk among subjects attending swimming pools relative to those
not attending.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated adults who swam in chlorinated pools to
determine whether exposure to DBPs in pool water is associated with
biomarkers of genotoxicity.
METHODS: We collected blood, urine, and exhaled air samples from 49
non-smoking adult volunteers before and after they swam for 40 min in an
indoor chlorinated pool. We estimated associations between the
concentrations of four trihalomethanes (THMs) in exhaled breath and
changes in micronuclei (MN) and DNA damage (comet assay) in peripheral
blood lymphocytes before and 1 hr after swimming; urine mutagenicity
(Ames assay) before and 2 hr after swimming; and MN in exfoliated
urothelial cells before and 2 weeks after swimming. We also estimated
associations and interactions with polymorphisms in genes related to DNA
repair or to DBP metabolism.
RESULTS: After swimming, the total concentration of the four THMs in
exhaled breath was seven times higher than before swimming. The change
in the frequency of micronucleated lymphocytes after swimming increased
in association with higher exhaled concentrations of the brominated THMs
(p = 0.03 for bromodichloromethane, p = 0.05 for chlorodibromomethane, p
= 0.01 for bromoform) but not chloroform. Swimming was not associated
with DNA damage detectable by the comet assay. Urine mutagenicity
increased significantly after swimming, in association with the higher
concentration of exhaled bromoform (p = 0.004). We found no significant
associations with changes in micronucleated urothelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support potential genotoxic effects of
exposure to DBPs from swimming pools. The positive health effects gained
by swimming could be increased by reducing the potential health risks of
pool water.}},

	abstract = {{A urinary trichloroacetic acid (TCA) concentration of 100 mg/l at the
end of the last work shift (8 h/day, 5 days/week) of the week has been
established in workers as exposure equivalent for the carcinogenic
substance trichloroethene (EKA for TRI) at an exposure concentration of
50 ppm TRI. Due to the continuous reduction of atmospheric TRI
concentrations during the last years, the quantitative relation given by
the EKA for TRI is revised for exposures to low TRI concentrations. A
physiological two-compartment model is presented by which the urinary
TCA concentrations are calculated that result from inhaled TRI in
humans. The model contains one compartment for trichloroethanol (TCE)
and one for TCA. Inhaled TRI is metabolized to TCA and to TCE. The
latter is in part further oxidized to TCA. Urinary elimination of TCA is
modeled to obey first order kinetics. All required model parameters were
taken form the literature. In order to evaluate the model performance on
the urinary TCA excretion at low exposure concentrations, predicted
urinary TCA concentrations were compared with data obtained in two
volunteer studies and in one field study. The model was evaluated at
exposure concentrations as low as 12.5 ppm TRI. It is demonstrated that
the correlation described by the hitherto used EKA for TRI is also valid
at low TRI concentrations. For TRI exposure concentrations of 0.6 and 6
ppm, the resulting urinary TCA concentrations at the end of the last
work shift of a week are predicted to be 1.2 and 12 mg/l, respectively.}},

in indoor swimming pool air. The use of stratification model is
important for estimating the risks for swimmers since they are exposed
to these kinds of situations while performing swimming and resting in
indoor swimming pools environment. The incremental lifetime cancer risk
(ILCR) was then estimated using the multi-pathway exposure model. The
results showed that the 95th percentile of ILCRs calculated for male and
female swimmers were 2.80 x 10(-4) and 2.47 x 10(-4), respectively. The
major exposure routes were found to be inhalation during swimming which
contributes to more than 99\% of the total health risk. Our study
suggested that to protect swimmers from excessive exposure to
chloroform, alternative methods or processes of disinfection should be
considered for swimming pool managers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	abstract = {{Toxicological studies indicate an association between exposure to
disinfection by-products (DBPs) and impaired male reproductive health in
animals. However, epidemiological evidence in humans is still limited.
We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study to investigate the
effect of exposure to DBPs on semen quality in humans. Between May 2008
and July 2008, we recruited 418 male partners in sub-fertile couples
seeking infertility medical instruction or assisted reproduction
services from the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Major semen
parameters analyzed included sperm concentration, motility, and
morphology. Exposure to DBPs was estimated by their urinary
creatinine-adjusted trichloroacetic (TCAA) concentrations that were
measured with the gas chromatography/electron capture detection method.
We used linear regression to assess the relationship between exposure to
DBPs and semen quality. According to the World Health Organization
criteria ( < 20 million/mL for sperm concentration and <50\% motile for
sperm motility) and threshold value recommended by Guzick ( < 9\% for
sperm morphology), there were 265 men with all parameters at or above
the reference values, 33 men below the reference sperm concentration,
151 men below the reference sperm motility, and 6 men below the
reference sperm morphology. The mean (median) urinary
creatinine-adjusted TCAA concentration was 9.2 (5.1) mu g/g creatinine.
Linear regression analyses indicated no significant association of sperm
concentration, sperm count, and sperm morphology with urinary TCAA
levels. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of
creatinine-adjusted urinary TCAA concentrations, subjects in the second
and third quartiles had a decrease of 5.1\% (95\% Cl: 0.6\%, 9.7\%) and
4.7\% (95\% Cl: 0.2\%, 9.2\%) in percent motility, respectively.
However, these associations were not significant after adjustment for
age, abstinence time, and smoking status. The present study provides
suggestive but inconclusive evidence of the relationship between
decreased sperm motility and increased urinary TCAA levels. The effect
of exposure to DBPs on human male reproductive health in Chinese
populations still warrants further investigations. (C) 2011 Elsevier

	abstract = {{Long-term stored (LTS) whole blood collection can be an important source
of DNA without collection costs, but there is a lack of information on
methods useful to extract genomic DNA from such type of biological
material. Here we report a simple and fast revisited phenol/chloroform
extraction method from LTS whole blood. Protocol reliability was
assessed by comparison with proteinase K and silicagel membrane spin
column-based DNA extraction methods using LTS -20 degrees C whole blood
from 1980, and by testing it on 82 whole blood samples, collected from
1980 to 1995, with high quality (A(260/280) = 1.79 +/- 0.32 OD.,
A(260/230) = 1.45 +/- 0.52 O.D.) and quantity results. Genotyping
efficiency was also checked by performing RFLP-PCR and ASP-PCR of p53
Pro72Arg (rs1042522) SNP and hTERT MNS16A VNTR, respectively, resulting
in 100\% of samples successfully typed. In addition to the goodness and
the efficiency of method proposed here, this protocol achieves working
time reduction combining extraction and purification steps, allowing to
work at room temperature. Furthermore, phenol is able to inactivate any
potential nuclease and potential infective sources from the first step
on. Based on these results we also conclude that LTS -20 degrees C whole
blood samples may be considered a reliable and potential resource for
future genotyping studies and retrospective analysis in a genetic
epidemiological setting. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{Background: Evidence for an association between exposure during
pregnancy to trihalomethanes (THMs) in drinking water and impaired fetal
growth is still inconsistent and inconclusive, in particular, for
various exposure routes. We examined the relationship of individual
exposures to THMs in drinking water on low birth weight (LBW), small for
gestational age (SGA), and birth weight (BW) in singleton births.
Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 4,161 pregnant women in Kaunas
(Lithuania), using individual information on drinking water, ingestion,
showering and bathing, and uptake factors of THMs in blood, to estimate
an internal dose of THM. We used regression analysis to evaluate the
relationship between internal THM dose and birth outcomes, adjusting for
family status, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index,
blood pressure, ethnic group, previous preterm, infant gender, and birth
year.
Results: The estimated internal dose of THMs ranged from 0.0025 to 2.40
mg/d. We found dose-response relationships for the entire pregnancy and
trimester-specific THM and chloroform internal dose and risk for LBW and
a reduction in BW. The adjusted odds ratio for third tertile vs. first
tertile chloroform internal dose of entire pregnancy was 2.17, 95\% CI
1.19-3.98 for LBW; the OR per every 0.1 mu g/d increase in chloroform
internal dose was 1.10, 95\% CI 1.01-1.19. Chloroform internal dose was
associated with a slightly increased risk of SGA (OR 1.19, 95\% CI
0.87-1.63 and OR 1.22, 95\% CI 0.89-1.68, respectively, for second and
third tertile of third trimester); the risk increased by 4\% per every
0.1 mu g/d increase in chloroform internal dose (OR 1.04, 95\% CI
1.00-1.09).
Conclusions: THM internal dose in pregnancy varies substantially across
individuals, and depends on both water THM levels and water use habits.

	abstract = {{For the first time, the exposure of swimmers and workers to haloacetic
acids (HAAs) in indoor and outdoor pools was evaluated through the
analysis of urine samples. The subjects of this study, 49 volunteers,
were male and female workers as well as swimmers (adults and children)
who regularly attended an indoor pool (January June) and an outdoor one
(July and August). The results showed that HAAs appeared 20-30 min after
exposure and were eliminated within 3 h. After 2 h exposure, urine
samples taken from workers contained dichloroacetic (DCAA) and
trichloroacetic (TCAA) acids at similar to 300 and similar to 120 ng/L
levels since HAAs were aerosolized in the indoor ambient, whereas only
DCAA was found in some workers' urine samples from the outdoor pool but
at similar to 50 ng/L levels, despite the fact that the outdoor pools
generally had somewhat higher levels of HAAs than the indoor pools.
After 1 h swimming TCAA, DCAA and MCAA were present at concentrations of
similar to 4400, similar to 2300, and similar to 560 ng/L, respectively,
in the swimmers' urine in the indoor pool; similar results were obtained
from the swimmers in the outdoor pool due to accidental ingestion.
Finally, exposure estimates indicate that ingestion is the major route
of exposure (similar to 94\%), followed by inhalation (similar to 5\%)
and dermal contribution (similar to 1\%).}},

	abstract = {{For an effective decomposition and removal of organic halogenated
compounds, a packed-bed non-thermal plasma reactor with in situ
absorption of the resulting halogenated products by alkaline sorbent
incorporated was proposed. In the plasma reactor, alpha-Al(2)O(3)
particles of 1 and 3 mm (mean particle diameter) were packed as solid
dielectric medium to enhance the plasma power density in the reactor.
Further, alkaline sorbent of Ca(OH)(2) was doped onto the surface of
alpha-Al(2)O(3) particles, in order to remove halogenated products by in
situ absorption with Ca(OH)(2). A high-voltage and high-frequency pulsed
power of -15 to 15 kV and 1 kHz was applied to the wire electrode of the
plasma reactor by means of a DC power source. In the present study, as
the sample of an organic halogenated compound that is most popularly
used, we selected dichloromethane (CH(2)Cl(2)), and 500 ppm of the
initial concentration of CH(2)Cl(2) was fed into the reactor accompanied
by air at a fixed flow rate of 500 x 10(-6) m(3) min(-1) at room
temperature. As a result, it was recognized that the amount of
CH(2)Cl(2) decomposed by non-thermal plasma in an alpha-Al(2)O(3)
particle bed increased with an increase in plasma input power. The ratio
of decomposition of CH(2)Cl(2) was almost 100\% at 13 kV of electric
power and 1 kHz frequency, and CO(2), CH(3)Cl, COCl(2), HCl, and Cl(2)
were observed as the major reaction products. On the other hand, when
CH(2)Cl(2) was introduced into the plasma reactor where alpha-Al(2)O(3)
particles doped with Ca(OH)(2) were packed, the ratio of decomposition
of CH(2)Cl(2) became higher, compared to the case that alpha-Al(2)O(3)
particles were not doped with Ca(OH)(2). Moreover, there were no
halogenated by-product gases detected in the outlet gas from the
reactor. As the solid reaction products, CaClOH and Ca(ClO)(2)center dot
4H(2)O were detected on Ca(OH)(2) by X-ray diffraction. From these
findings, it was recognized that CH(2)Cl(2) was decomposed more
effectively without producing unwanted harmful halogenated byproducts in
the proposed non-thermal plasma reactor where alpha-Al(2)O(3) particles
doped with Ca(OH)(2) sorbent were packed.}},

	abstract = {{Although prenatal exposure to water disinfection by-products does not
appear to affect the duration of gestation, its impact on fetal growth
remains an open question. The authors studied the associations between
prenatal exposure to disinfection by-products and fetal growth
restriction (FGR) and preterm birth in the PELAGIE cohort, a French
birth cohort comprising 3,421 pregnant women recruited between 2002 and
2006. Exposure was assessed by estimating levels of trihalomethanes
(THMs) in tap water during pregnancy and maternal water use and by
measuring maternal urinary levels of trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) during
early pregnancy in a nested case-control design that compared 174 FGR
cases, 114 preterm births, and 399 controls. Higher uptake of THMs
(especially brominated THMs) was associated with a higher risk of FGR.
Women with TCAA detected in their urine (>0.01 mg/L) had a higher risk
of FGR than those with TCAA levels below the detection limit (adjusted
odds ratio 1.8, 95\% confidence interval: 0.9, 3.7) and had an odds
ratio for preterm birth below 1 (adjusted odds ratio 0.8, 95\%
confidence interval: 0.3, 2.6). Results from this prospective study, the
first to use a biomarker of disinfection by-product exposure, suggest
that prenatal exposure affects fetal growth, but the causal agent or
agents remain to be identified.}},

	abstract = {{Background: The effect of exposure to disinfection by-products (DBPs)
during pregnancy on newborn's birth weight has been commonly described
in animal studies. However, epidemiological evidence was not consistent.
Objectives: To investigate the relationship between exposure to DBPs and
newborn's birth weight in a Chinese population, we conducted a
cross-sectional study in Wuhan, China.
Methods: A total number of 398 women who had given birth to a live
singleton with a gestational age between 37 to 42 weeks were recruited
from a local hospital between November 2008 and May 2009. Basic
information for all mothers and newborns was obtained from clinic birth
records. Among these subjects, 180 women also gave further information
including maternal medical history, social status and water-use
behaviors by a face-to-face interview. Urinary creatinine (Cr) adjusted
trichloroacetic (TCAA) was used as an exposure biomarker.
Results: No statically significant results were found in the linear
regression for both 398 participants and 180 participants who finished
questionnaires. However, both the crude and adjusted results showed that
the mean birth weight of the subjects in the third and top quartiles of
Cr-adjusted urinary TCAA concentrations was decreased compared with
those in the lowest quartile. Subjects in the top quartiles had the
lowest mean birth weight compared to those in other quartiles. In
addition, a weak correlation was observed among 82 subjects between
drinking water ingestion and urinary Cr-adjusted TCAA (r = 0.23, P =
0.04).
Conclusion: Our findings suggested that elevated exposure to DBPs may
affect fetal growth. The effect of exposure to DBPs during pregnancy on
birth weight still warrants further investigations. (C) 2011 Elsevier

@article{ISI:000303546000028,
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have used various measures to
characterize trihalomethane (THM) exposures, but the relationship of
these indicators to exposure biomarkers remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We examined temporal and spatial variability in baseline
blood THM concentrations and assessed the relationship between these
concentrations and several exposure indicators (tap water concentration,
water-use activities, multiroute exposure metrics).
METHODS: We measured water-use activity and THM concentrations in blood
and residential tap water from 150 postpartum women from three U.S.
locations.
RESULTS: Blood Sigma THM {[}sum of chloroform (TCM),
bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM), and bromoform
(TBM)] concentrations varied by site and season. As expected based on
variable tap water concentrations and toxicokinetic properties, the
proportion of brominated species (BDCM, DBCM, and TBM) in blood varied
by site (site 1, 24\%; site 2, 29\%; site 3, 57\%) but varied less
markedly than in tap water (site 1, 35\%; site 2, 75\%; site 3, 68\%).
The blood-water Sigma THM Spearman rank correlation coefficient was
0.36, with correlations higher for individual brominated species (BDCM,
0.62; DBCM, 0.53; TBM, 0.54) than for TCM (0.37). Noningestion water
activities contributed more to the total exposure metric than did
ingestion, but tap water THM concentrations were more predictive of
blood THM levels than were metrics that incorporated water use.
CONCLUSIONS: Spatial and temporal variability in THM concentrations was
greater in water than in blood. We found consistent blood-water
correlations across season and site for BDCM and DBCM, and multivariate
regression results suggest that water THM concentrations may be an
adequate surro gate for baseline blood levels.}},

anti-selectivity to give bicyclo{[}3.1.1]heptane derivatives with the

of 1-(X-methylsulfonyl)tricyclo{[}4.1.0.0(2,7)]heptanes. Under analogous
conditions the anti-adducts (X = Me) are converted into
1,2-bis(7-syn-methylsulfonyl-6-endo-R-bicyclo{[}3.1.1]hept-6-exo-yl)disu

	abstract = {{Potassium bromate (KBrO3) is a widely used food additive, a water
disinfection by-product and a known nephrotoxic agent. The effect of
KBrO3 on rat blood, especially on the anti-oxidant defense system, was
studied in this work. Animals were given a single oral dose of KBrO3
(100 mg/kg body weight) and sacrificed 12, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h after
this treatment. Blood was collected from the animals and separated into
plasma and erythrocytes. KBrO3 administration resulted in increased
lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, hydrogen peroxide levels and
decreased the reduced glutathione content indicating the induction of
oxidative stress in blood. Methemoglobin levels and methemoglobin
reductase activity were significantly increased while the total
anti-oxidant power was greatly reduced upon KBrO3 treatment. Nitric
oxide levels were enhanced while vitamin C concentration decreased in
KBrO3 treated animals. The activities of major anti-oxidant enzymes were
also altered upon KBrO3 treatment. The maximum changes in all these
parameters were 48 h after the administration of KBrO3 and then recovery
took place. These results show for the first time that KBrO3 induces
oxidative stress in blood and impairs the anti-oxidant defense system.
Thus impairment in the anti-oxidant power and alterations in the
activities of major anti-oxidant enzymes may play an important role in
mediating the toxic effects of KBrO3 in the rat blood. The study of such
biochemical events in blood will help elucidate the molecular mechanism
of action of KBrO3 and also for devising methods to overcome its toxic
effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

	abstract = {{This first study of trihalomethanes (THMs) in swimming pools using
bromine agents for water disinfection under real conditions shows that
the mixtures of these compounds are largely dominated by bromoform in a
similar process as chloroform becomes the dominant THM in pools
disinfected with chlorine agents. Bromoform largely predominates in air
and water of the pool installations whose concentration changes are
linearly correlated. However, the air concentrations of bromoform
account for about 6-11\% of the expected concentrations according to
theoretical partitioning defined by the Henry law. Bromoform in exhaled
air of swimmers is correlated with the air concentrations of this
disinfectant by-product in the pool building. Comparison of the THM
exhaled air concentrations between swimmers and volunteers bathing in
the water without swimming or standing in the building outside the water
suggest that physical activity enhance exposure to these disinfectant
by-products. They also indicate that in swimming pools, besides
inhalation, dermal absorption is a relevant route for the incorporation
of THMs, particularly those with lower degree of bromination. (c) 2012

	abstract = {{Lipid extraction from biological samples is a critical and often tedious
preanalytical step in lipid research. Primarily on the basis of
automation criteria, we have developed the BUME method, a novel
chloroform-free total lipid extraction method for blood plasma
compatible with standard 96-well robots. In only 60 min, 96 samples can
be automatically extracted with lipid profiles of commonly analyzed
lipid classes almost identically and with absolute recoveries similar or
better to what is obtained using the chloroform-based reference method.
Lipid recoveries were linear from 10-100 mu l plasma for all
investigated lipids using the developed extraction protocol. The BUME
protocol includes an initial one-phase extraction of plasma into 300 mu
l butanol: methanol (BUME) mixture (3: 1) followed by two-phase
extraction into 300 mu l heptane: ethyl acetate (3: 1) using 300 mu l
1\% acetic acid as buffer. The lipids investigated included the most
abundant plasma lipid classes (e. g., cholesterol ester, free
cholesterol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin) as
well as less abundant but biologically important lipid classes,
including ceramide, diacylglycerol, and lyso-phospholipids. This novel
method has been successfully implemented in our laboratory and is now
used daily. We conclude that the fully automated, high-throughput BUME
method can replace chloroform-based methods, saving both human and
environmental resources. Lofgren, L., M. Stahlman, G-B. Forsberg, S.

	abstract = {{A reliable and sensitive method for simultaneous determination of
perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) is described after extraction and preconcentration by a new
solid-phase microextraction (SPME) adsorbent. The potential of
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as SPME adsorbent for the
pre-concentration of environmental pollutants has been investigated in
recent years. This work was carried out to investigate the feasibility
of SWCNTs as a headspace SPME adsorbent for the determination of
chloroethylenes in human urine. SWCNTs were attached onto a stainless
steel wire through an organic binder. Potential factors affecting the
extraction efficiency, including extraction time, extraction
temperature, desorption time, desorption temperature, and salinity were
optimized. The developed method showed good performance. For PCE and
TCE, calibration curves were linear (r(2) >= 0.994) over the
concentration ranges from 15 to 8000 ng L-1 and the limit of detection
(LOD) at signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3 was 5 ng L-1. The analytical
procedure also involves derivatization of TCA with dimethyl sulfate,
before headspace sampling. For TCA the linear range and LOD were 45-8000
(r(2) >= 0.992) and 15 ng L-1, respectively. In addition, a comparative
study between the SWCNT and a commercial carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane
(CAR/PDMS) SPME fibre for the determination of chloroethylenes in human
urine was carried out. SWCNT fibre showed higher extraction capacity,
better thermal stability (over 350 degrees C) and longer life span (over
200 times) than the commercial CAR/PDMS fibre. The developed method was
successfully applied to determine chloroethylenes in human urine
samples. As the results indicated, the mean concentrations of TCE, PCE
and TCA in exposed workers (dry-cleaning industry workers) were
significantly greater than that of control group.}},

	abstract = {{Although disinfection of domestic water supply is crucial for protecting
public health from waterborne diseases, this process forms potentially
harmful by-products, such as trihalomethanes (THMs). We evaluated the
influence of physicochemical properties of four THMs (chloroform,
bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) on the
internal dose after showering. One hundred volunteers showered for 10
min in a controlled setting with fixed water flow, air flow, and
temperature. We measured THMs in shower water, shower air, bathroom air,
and blood samples collected at various time intervals. The geometric
mean (GM) for total THM concentration in shower water was 96.2 mu g/l.
The GM of total THM in air increased from 5.8 mu g/m(3) pre shower to
351 mu g/m(3) during showering. Similarly, the GM of total-blood THM
concentration increased from 16.5 ng/l pre shower to 299 ng/l at 10 min
post shower. THM levels were significantly correlated between different
matrices (e.g. dibromochloromethane levels) in water and air (r=0.941);
blood and water (r=0.845); and blood and air (r=0.831). The slopes of
best-fit lines for THM levels in water vs air and blood vs air increased
with increasing partition coefficient of water/air and blood/air. The
slope of the correlation plot of THM levels in water vs air decreased in
a linear (r=0.995) fashion with increasing Henry's law constant. The
physicochemical properties (volatility, partition coefficients, and
Henry's law constant) are useful parameters for predicting THM movement
between matrices and understanding THM exposure during showering.

	abstract = {{The variability of trihalomethane (THM) levels in drinking water raises
the question of whether or not short-term variations (within-day) should
be accounted for when assessing exposure to contaminants suspected of
being carcinogenic and reprotoxic agents. The purpose of this study was
to determine the magnitude of the impact on predicted biological levels
of THMs (internal doses) exerted by within-day variations of THMs in
drinking water. A database extracted from a campaign in the Quebec City
distribution system served to produce 81, 79 and 64 concentration
profiles for the three most abundant THMs, namely chloroform (TCM),
dichlorobromomethane (DCBM) and chlorodibromomethane (CDBM),
respectively. Using a physiologically based toxicokinetic modeling
approach, we simulated exposures (1.5 l water per day and a 10-min
shower) based on each of these profiles and predicted, for 2000
individuals (Monte-Carlo simulations), maximum blood concentrations
(Cmax), areas under the time versus blood concentrations curve (24
h-AUCcv) and total absorbed doses (ADs). Three different hypotheses were
tested: {[}A] assuming a constant THM concentration in water (e.g., mean
value of a day); {[}B] accounting for within-day variations in THM
levels; and {[}C] a worst-case scenario assuming within-day variations
and showering while THM levels were maximal. For each exposure profile,
exposure indicator and individual, we calculated the ratios of values
obtained according to each hypothesis (e.g., CmaxB/CmaxA and
CmaxC/CmaxA) and the values corresponding to the 5th and 95th
percentiles of these ratios. The closer these percentiles are to the
value of 1, the smaller the error associated with assuming constant THM
concentrations rather than their actual variability. Results showed that
the minimal gap between these percentiles was TCM-AD(B)/TCM-AD(A) (5th =
0.91; 95th = 1.09), whereas the maximal gap was CDBM Cmax(C)/CDBM
Cmax(A) (5th = 0.50; 95th = 3.40). Overall, TCM and ADs were the less
affected (TCM<DCBM<CDBM and AD<AUCcv<Cmax) when accounting for
within-day variations in water levels. Journal of Exposure Science and

	abstract = {{Little is known about genetic susceptibility to individual
trihalomethanes (THM) in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes. We
conducted a nested case-control study of 682 pregnant women in Kaunas
(Lithuania) and, using individual information on drinking water,
ingestion, showering and bathing, and uptake factors of THMs in blood,
estimated an internal THM dose. We used logistic regression to evaluate
the relationship between internal THM dose, birth outcomes and
individual and joint (modifying) effects of metabolic gene
polymorphisms. THM exposure during entire pregnancy and specific
trimesters slightly increased low birth weight (LBW) risk. When
considering both THM exposure and maternal genotypes, the largest
associations were found for third trimester among total THM (TTHM) and
chloroform-exposed women with the GSTM1-0 genotype (OR: 4.37; 95\% CI:
1.36-14.08 and OR: 5.06; 95\% CI: 1.50-17.05, respectively). A test of
interaction between internal THM dose and GSTM1-0 genotype suggested a
modifying effect of exposure to chloroform and bromodichloromethane on
LBW risk. However, the effect on small for gestational age (SGA) was not
statistically significant. These data suggest that THM internal dose may
affect foetal growth and that maternal GSTM1 genotype modifies the THM
exposure effects on LBW.}},

	abstract = {{The performance of a plasma reactor for the degradation of chlorinated
hydrocarbon waste is reported. Chloroform was used as a target for a
recently patented destruction process based using an inductive plasma
torch. Liquid waste was directly injected axially into the argon plasma
with a supplied power of similar to 4 kW in the presence of oxygen as
oxidant and carrier gas. Decomposition was performed at CHCl3 feed rates
up to 400 g h(-1) with different oxygen/waste molar ratios, chloroform
destruction was obtained with at least 99\% efficiency and the energy
efficiency reached 100 g kWh(-1). The conversion end products were
identified and assayed by online FTIR spectroscopy (CO2, HCl and H2O)
and redox titration (Cl-2). Considering phosgene as representative of
toxic compounds, only very small quantities of toxics were released (<1
gh(-1)) even with high waste feed rates. The experimental results were
very close to the equilibrium composition predicted by thermodynamic
calculations. At the bottom of the reactor, the chlorinated acids were
successfully trapped in a scrubber and transformed into mineral salts,
hence, only CO2 and H2O have been found in the final off-gases
composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

@article{ISI:000317454000017,
	abstract = {{Toxicological studies showed that trihalomethanes (THMs), the most
abundant classes of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water,
impaired male reproductive health, but epidemiological evidence is
limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to examine the associations
of baseline blood THMs with semen parameters and serum total
testosterone in a Chinese population. We recruited 401 men seeking semen
examination from the Reproductive Center of Tone Hospital in Wuhan,
China between April 2011 and May 2012. Baseline blood concentrations of
THMs, including chloroform (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM),
dibromochloromethane (DBCM), and bromoform (TBM) were measured using
SPME-GC/ECD method. Semen quality and serum total testosterone were
analyzed. Multivariable linear regressions were used to assess the
associations of baseline blood THM concentrations with semen parameters
and serum total testosterone levels. We found that baseline blood THM
concentrations were not associated with decrements in sperm motility,
sperm straight-line and curvilinear velocity. However, moderate levels
of BDCM(beta=-0.13 million; 95\% CI:-0.22, -0.03) and DBCM
(beta=-4.74\%; 95\% CI:-8.07, -1.42) were associated with decreased
sperm count and declined sperm linearity compared with low levels,
respectively. Suggestive dose-response relationships were also observed
between elevated blood TCM or Sigma THMs (sum of TCM, BDCM, DBCM and
TBM) concentration and decreased sperm concentration (both p for trend =
0.07), and between elevated blood DBCM concentration and decreased serum
total testosterone (p for trend = 0.07). Our results indicate that
elevated THM exposure may lead to decreased sperm concentration and
serum total testosterone. However, the effects of THM exposure on male
reproductive health still warrant further studies in humans. (C) 2013

@article{ISI:000317539500032,
	abstract = {{Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are two commonly used DNA-alkylating
agents in cancer chemotherapy that undergo biotransformation to several
toxic and non-toxic metabolites, including acrolein and
chloroacetaldehyde (CAA). Acrolein and CAA toxicities occur by several
different mechanisms, including ROS formation and protein damage
(oxidation), however, these pathways of toxicity and protecting agents
used to prevent them have yet to be compared and ranked in a single
study. This research focused on the molecular targets of acrolein and
CAA toxicities and strategies to decrease toxicities. Hepatocyte
viability (cytotoxicity) was assessed using Trypan blue uptake;
formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endogenous H2O2 were also
assessed in the hepatocyte model. In cell-free models (bovine serum
albumin and hepatic microsomes), protein carbonylation was the
measurement of toxicity. The present study demonstrated that acrolein
was a more potent toxin than CM for freshly isolated rat hepatocytes,
bovine serum albumin and rat hepatic microsomes. Acrolein protein
carbonylation was dependent on its concentration; as acrolein
concentration increased, protein carbonylation increased in a linear
trend, whereas, CM deviated from the trend and did not cause protein
carbonylation at lower concentrations (<400 mu M). Aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a major pathway for detoxifying pathway for CM
in hepatocytes, as a 3-fold increase in cytotoxicity occurred when cells
were incubated with cyanamide, an ALDH inhibitor. Inhibiting ALDH or
depleting GSH in hepatocytes increased cytotoxicity by about 3-fold in
acrolein-treated hepatocytes. The overall effectiveness of protecting
agents to prevent or suppress acrolein or CAA toxicities in cell and
cell-free models were ranked in order of most effective to least
effective: reducing agents (sodium borohydride, sodium bisulfite) >
thiol-containing compounds (N-acetylcysteine, cysteine, glutathione,
2-mercaptoethane sulfonate {[}MESNA], penicillamine) > carbonyl
scavengers/amines (aminoguanidine, hydralazine, hydroxylamine) >
antioxidants/ROS scavengers (ascorbic acid, Trolox; only utilized in
hepatocyte system). An understanding of acrolein and CM toxicities and
the ability of protecting agents to protect against toxicities may help
to establish or improve existing therapeutic interventions against the
side effects associated with acrolein or CM in cyclophosphamide or
ifosfamide treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

	abstract = {{Known as the most important byproducts of water disinfection with
chlorigen chemicals, trihalomethanes (THMs) are incriminated in causing
severe effects upon human health. The exposure pathways that can lead to
potentially significant uptake of THMs include for adults ingestion of
tap water and inhalation of THMs in vapor phase resulting from bathing,
showering and washing. The purpose of this paper is the exposure
assessment to THMs through ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption
in a group of people and to measure THMs in urine as biomarker of
exposure for a group of volunteer subjects, under different condition of
exposure. The subjects were investigated based on a questionnaire that
included questions about drinking water consumption, lifestyle or other
exposures to water. Along with the collection of urine samples, cold and
hot tap water was taken from the subjects residences. The THMs from
water and urine were measured by gas-chromatography technique. The
results showed that the only THMs compound measured in urine of the
subjects exposed to THMs (chloroform, bromodichloromethane and
dibromochloromethane) from water was chloroform. It's identification in
urine showed that the frequency and duration of exposure could be more
important than the concentration of the xenobiotic in water. The route
of exposure having a decisive contribution to the daily intake of THMs
was related to ingestion and secondary to inhalation for chloroform, or
dermal absorption for bromodichloromethane. The presence of THMs in
urine in different concentrations may be linked to the individual
particularities of metabolization and elimination specific to each
organism.}},

(TcO4-)-Tc-99m from HCl solution by chelating with ammonium
tetramethylenedithiocarbamate (ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate;
APDC) into chloroform was carried out. Extraction parameters such as the
effect of acidity in the aqueous phase on the extraction efficiency,
concentration of APDC, shaking time, volume ratio of the aqueous to the
organic solutions, back-extraction, electrical charge study of Tc-99m
ion in dilute HCl, lipophilicity and the stability of the complex and
the extraction of numerous interfering radionuclides were studied. The
optimum conditions found were applied in the development of a procedure
for the determination of Tc-99 in low-level radioactive wastes. Using
Tc-99m as an internal tracer for the evaluation, the recoveries of Tc-99
in the various types of low-level radioactive waste samples were higher
than 90\%. The extraction factors for most of the accompanying
radionuclides were higher than 10(5). The detection limit for Tc-99 in a
sample of 0.005 kg is 4.2 Bq kg-1 (0.11 pCi g-1) for a 100-min counting

	abstract = {{Male Fisher 344 rats were administered 1- or
2-{[}C-14]trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN) by oral gavage.  DNA was isolated
from the liver, kidneys and stomach and several protein fractions
(globin, albumin and globulins) were isolated from blood.  TCAN binds to
both the DNA and the blood proteins in a dose-related manner.  More
radiolable was associated with the DNA when the carbon at C2 position
was labeled, than at C1 position.  However, the position of the
radiolable did not influence the levels of radioactivity associated with
the blood proteins.  The stomach exhibited the highest level of DNA
binding, followed in order by the liver and kidney.  TCAN binding level
was higher in DNA isolated from rats killed at 24 h than at 4 h after
administration.  In contrast, the three blood proteins showed similar
binding levels, regardless of the exposure time.  Radioactivity
associated with DNA was not incorporated into the nitrogen bases (i.e.
via de novo synthesis) and a covalent binding index (mu-mol chemical
bound/mol nucleotide phosphate per mmol/kg body wt. of chemical
administered) of 30-120 observed for various tissues.  Most of the
radioactivity (60-80\%) associated with globin could be released and
separated from the protein by the treatment with concentrated ammonium
hydroxide and precipitation of protein by organic solvent.  Three peaks
were observed in the HPLC elution profiles of the radioactivity released
from the globin.  Trichloroacetic acid co-eluted with one of these
released products (peak II), however, the chemical identity of the
material under the major peak (peak III) and peak I are still
uncharacterized.}},

80\% monochloroacetic acid solution on 25-30\% of his body surface. In
addition to epidermal and superficial dermal burns, features of systemic
poisoning occurred within a few hours including disorientation,
agitation, cardiac failure and coma. He later developed severe metabolic
acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal insufficiency and cerebral edema, and
died due to uncal herniation on d 8. The 4 h post exposure plasma
monochloroacetic acid concentration was 33 mg/L confirming skin
absorption. In addition to its corrosive action, monochloroacetic acid
probably blocks the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Kreb's cycle) and may also
react with sulfhydryl groups in enzymes, causing severe tissue damage in
energy-rich organs.}},

	abstract = {{Individual serum bile acids (SBA) are emerging as potentially useful
early indicators of liver injury. This study was undertaken to compare
the usefulness of individual SBA with the routinely used assays for
detecting the effects of the hepatotoxicants carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)
and chloroform (CHCl3). Serum samples were assayed for liver injury by
determination of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
amino-transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and total
bile acid (by enzymatic kit). These results were compared with levels of
individual SBA measured by high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Liver samples from CCl4-treated rats were taken for light and
electron microscopic examination. The highest dose for each chemical
caused increases in serum ALT and AST but not ALP. Chloroform at the
highest dose increased bilirubin. Total SBA levels as assayed by the kit
were elevated in response to CCl4 and CHCl3 at doses below which serum
enzymes and bilirubin were increased. Some individual SBA were increased
at a still lower dose for each of these two chlorinated solvents. At the
lowest dose of CCl4 tested no consistent light microscopic or
ultrastructural changes were found. At all the higher doses periacinar
cells displayed typical accumulation of lipid droplets and degranulation
and dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The extent of the
ultrastructural changes were dose-dependent. Thus individual SBA assayed
by HPLC may be considered as a very sensitive indicator of liver injury
induced by the classical hepatotoxicants carbon tetrachloride and
chloroform.}},

344 rats over the 48 h after oral gavage of 282 mg/kg of 1- or
2-{[}C-14]-DCA (1-DCA or 2-DCA) and 28.2 mg/kg of 2-DCA. DCA was
absorbed quickly, and the major route of disposition was through
exhalation of carbon dioxide and elimination in the urine. The
dispositions of 1- and 2-DCA at 282 mg/kg were similar With 2-DCA, the
disposition differed with dose in that the percentage of the dose
expired as carbon dioxide decreased from 34.4\% (28.2 mg/kg) to 25.0\%
(282 mg/kg), while the percentage of the radioactivity excreted in the
urine increased from 12.7 to 35.2\%. This percentage increase in the
urinary excretion was mostly attributable to the presence of
unmetabolized DCA, which comprised more than 20\% at the higher dose and
less than 1\% at the lower dose. The major urinary metabolites were
glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and oxalic acid. DCA and its metabolites
accumulated in the tissues and were eliminated slowly. After 48 h,
36.4\%, 26.2\%, and 20.8\% of the dose was retained in the tissues of
rats administered 28.2 and 282 mg/kg of 2-DCA and 282 mg/kg of 1-DCA,
respectively. Of the organs examined, the liver (4.9-7.9\% of dose) and
muscle (4.5-9.9\%) contained the most radioactivity, followed by skin
(3.3-4.5\%), blood (1.4-2.6\%), and intestines (1.0-1.7\%). One
metabolIte, glyoxylic acid, which is mutagenic, might be responsible for
or contribute to the carcinogenicity of DCA.}},

	abstract = {{A hitherto unknown glutathione-S-transferase in human erythrocytes
displays polymorphism: three quarters of the population
(''conjugators'') possess, whereas one quarter (''non-conjugators'')
lack this specific activity. A standard method for the identification of
conjugators and non-conjugators with the use of methyl bromide and gas
chromatography (head space technique) is described. Three substrates of
the polymorphic enzyme, methyl bromide, ethylene oxide and
dichloromethane (methylene chloride), were incubated in vitro with
individual whole blood samples of conjugators and non-conjugators. All
three substances led to a marked increase of sister chromatid exchanges
(SCE) in the lymphocytes of the non-conjugators but not in those of
conjugators. A protective effect of the glutathione-S-transferase
activity in human erythrocytes for the cytogenetic toxicity of these
chemicals in vitro is thus confirmed. Since the enzyme activity is not
found in erythrocytes of laboratory animals, species extrapolations for
risk assessment of methyl bromide, ethylene oxide and dichloromethane
should be reconsidered.}},

	abstract = {{1   The metabolism of dichloromethane (DCM) to carbon monoxide as
measured by the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level in the blood is
stimulated by pretreatment with methanol (MET). After simultaneous
administration of both DCM, 6.2 mmol kg-1 p.o., and MET, > 148 mmol kg-1
p.o., the COHb formation is inhibited.
2   MET ingestion results in a transient decrease of the glutathione
(GSH) content of the liver. In rats treated with GSH-depleting chemicals
such as diethylmaleate (DEM), phorone (PHO), or buthionine sulphoximine
(BSO) there were no enhancements of the carboxyhaemoglobinaemia caused
by DCM. The COHb formation was not influenced by an increase of the
hepatic GSH concentration due to repeated administration of butylated
hydroxyanisole (BHA).
3  It is concluded that cytochrome P450 IIE1 (CYP 2E1) is responsible
for the metabolic interaction of both DCM and MET, and MET may be an
inducer of CYP 2E1.  The two pathways of DCM, the oxidative via CYP 2E1
and the metabolism via GSH/GSH-S-transferase seem to be independent.}},

	abstract = {{The hepatotoxic effects of chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents have been
well recognized for many years. More recently serum bile acids (SBA)
have been considered as a sensitive indicator for the determination of
liver dysfunction. However, changes in SBA could result from
interference with hepatic transport processes. In this study, the
effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and chloroform (CHCl3) on uptake
and efflux of bile acids were examined in isolated rat liver cells to
determine whether this may play a role in elevated SBA after CCl4 or
CHCl3 treatment. Cholic acid (CA) and taurocholic acid (TC) were
selected as representative bile acids known to enter hepatocytes by
active transport. At none of the doses of CCl4 and CHCl3 investigated
was there a significant change in cytoplasmic enzymes or intracellular
K+ release. CCl4 and CHCl3 were both found to cause a dose-related
inhibition of uptake of CA and TC. Furthermore, CCl4 and CHCl3 were
shown to increase the Michaelis constant (K(m)) but leave maximum
velocity (V(max)) unchanged thus indicating competitive inhibition. The
lowest doses of CCl4 and CHCl3 at which inhibition of initial uptake
rate (V0) occurred for CA or TC were found to be 0.5 mul/flask (0.07 mm)
or 1.0 mul/ flask (0.17 mm) in cell suspensions, respectively. The
inhibition of uptake could be reversed 30 min after cessation of
exposure to CCl4.  No chemical-induced interference of efflux for CA or
TC was found in preloaded cells. These findings indicate that
interference in bile acid uptake may be involved, at least in part, in
the increases in SBA in dosed animals, or workers exposed to CCl4, CHCl3
and perhaps other chlorinated solvents.}},

	abstract = {{Dihalomethanes can produce liver tumors in mice but not in rats, and
concern exists about the risk of these compounds to humans. Glutathione
(GSH) conjugation of dihalomethanes has been considered to be a critical
event in the bioactivation process, and risk assessment is based upon
this premise; however, there is little experimental support for this
view or information about the basis of genotoxicity. A plasmid vector
containing rat GSH S-transferase 5-5 was transfected into the Salmonella
typhimurium tester strain TA1535, which then produced active enzyme. The
transfected bacteria produced base-pair revertants in the presence of
ethylene dihalides or dihalomethanes, in the order CH2Br2 > CH2BrCl >
CH2Cl2. However, revertants were not seen when cells were exposed to
GSH, CH2Br2, and an amount of purified GSH S-transferase 5-5 (20-fold
excess in amount of that expressed within the cells). HCHO, which is an
end product of the reaction of GSH with dibalomethanes, also did not
produce mutations. S-(1-Acetoxymethyl)GSH was prepared as an analog of
the putative S-(1-halomethyl)GSH reactive intermediates. This analog did
not produce revertants, consistent with the view that activation of
dihalomethanes must occur within the bacteria to cause genetic damage,
presenting a model to be considered in studies with mammalian cells.
S-(1-Acetoxymethyl) GSH reacted with 2'-deoxyguanosine to yield a major
adduct, identified as S-{[}1-(N2-deoxyguanosinyl)methyl]GSH.
Demonstration of the activation of dihalomethanes by this mammalian GSH
S-transferase theta class enzyme should be of use in evaluating the risk
of these chemicals, particularly in fight of reports of the polymorphic
expression of a similar activity in humans.}},

	abstract = {{We have previously reported that human cells and tissues contain a
1,N6-ethenoadenine (epsilonA) binding protein, which, through
glycosylase activity, releases both 3-methyladenine (m3A) and epsilonA
from DNA treated with methylating agents or the vinyl chloride
metabolite chloroacetaldehyde, respectively. We now find that both the
partially purified human epsilonA-binding protein and cell-free extracts
containing the cloned human m3A-DNA glycosylase release all four cyclic
etheno adducts-namely epsilonA, 3,N4-ethenocytosine (epsilonC),
N2,3-ethenoguanine (N2,3-epsilonG), and 1,N2-ethenoguanine
(1,N2-epsilonG). Base release was both time and protein concentration
dependent. Both epsilonA and epsilonC were excised at similar rates,
while 1,N2-epsilonG and N2,3-epsilonG were released much more slowly
under identical conditions. The cleavage of glycosyl bonds of several
heterocyclic adducts as well as those of simple methylated adducts by
the same human glycosylase appears unusual in enzymology. This raises
the question of how such a multiple, divergent activity evolved in
humans and what may be its primary substrate.}},

	abstract = {{The mechanism of formation of etheno (epsilon) adducts of nucleic acid
bases from 2-haloacetaldehydes is generally assumed to occur via initial
Schiff base formation resulting from reaction of the aldehyde with an
exocyclic amine. We recently revised the H-1 NMR assignments of the E
protons of 1,N2-epsilon-Guo (Guengerich, F. P., Persmark, M. P., and
Humphreys, W. G. (1993) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 6, 635-648). In that work we
also observed a facile and specific exchange of H7 of 1,N2-epsilon-Guo
and H5 of N2,3-epsilon-Gua with H2O. These findings raise questions
about the mechanistic conclusions reached on the basis of labeling
studies with deuterated ClCH2CHO (Sattsangi, P. D., Leonard, N. J., and
Frihart, C. R. (1977) J. Org. Chem. 42, 3292-3296). (BrCH2CHO)-C-13 was
prepared from (BrCH2CO2H)-C-13 and used to prepare 1,N 2-epsilon-Guo
(from Guo) and O6-ethyl-N 2,3-epsilon-Gua (from O6-ethylGua). The
positions of the labels were determined by H-1 NMR spectroscopy
experiments to be adjacent to the original Gua N2 (exocyclic) atom in
both cases, i.e., at C6 in both epsilon products. The labeling patterns
are consistent with a mechanism involving initial Schiff base formation
from the N2 atom and the aldehyde and subsequent nucleophilic attack of
an endocyclic nitrogen on the methylene carbon.}},

{[}(eta5-C5Me5)Re(NO)-(PPh3)(ClC6H5)]+BF4-(4). The latter is a mixture
of linkage and constitutional isomers. Reactions of 3 and halide ions X-
give mainly (eta5-C5Me5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(CI) (6) and XCH2Cl, but 4 and
Ph3PCH3+I- yield (eta5-C5Me5)-Re(NO)(PPh3)(I) (84\%). Reaction of 3 and
Et4N+CN- gives comparable amounts of 6 and
(eta5-C5Me5)Re(NO)-(PPh3)(CN). The latter forms in 90\% ee when
(-)-(R)-5 (>95\% ee) is employed. When 3 is warmed to -35-degrees-C, the
oxidative addition product
{[}(eta5-C5Me5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(Cl)(CH2Cl)]+BF4-(10)forms. Reaction of 3 and

in the presence of excess styrene or ethyne. Reactions of 4 and
1-pentene or styrene give the alkene complexes

without gaps (CA +; CA -), aberrant cells (AC), micronuclei (MN),
sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with high frequencies of
SCEs (HFCs) were measured in lymphocytes collected from 46 workers
occupationally exposed to styrene and dichloromethane (DCM = methylene
chloride). These parameters were also determined in 23 controls.
Time-weighted average (TWA) values for styrene and DCM exposure during
an 8-h working day were respectively 70 mg/m(3) (range: 0-598) and 108
mg/m(3) (range: 0-742). These values correspond to TWA values of 17 ppm
styrene and 31 ppm DCM. In exposed workers, ah cytogenetic parameters
were significantly enhanced (P < 0.0001; one-sided), but, due to the
lack of appropriate control data, no definite conclusions could be drawn
concerning the mutagenicity of styrene/DCM exposure. Duration of
exposure was not correlated with genetic effects analyzed. The TWA value
for styrene was not correlated with the extent of genetic damage
detected, but the TWA value for DCM was positively correlated with the
frequencies of chromosome aberrations (with gaps) and aberrant cells.
These observations make it difficult to decide whether styrene or DCM,
or both chemicals, induced the cytogenetic effects observed in exposed
workers. Using the present styrene/DCM data, earlier ethylene oxide data
and unpublished epichlorohydrin data, the relative sensitivity of the
genetic endpoints to detect genotoxic exposure was: HFC > CA - > CA + >
SCE > MN > HPRT.}},

	abstract = {{Recently potentiation of oxidative damage in rat red blood cells (rRBC)
incubated with t-butylhydroperoxide (BHP) in combination with
bromotrithloromethane (BrCCl3) was demonstrated. The mechanism by which
this combination (BrCCl3/BHP) potentiates the oxidative damage to rRBC
was investigated in this study. When rRBC were incubated with 0.1 mM
BHP, 0.5 mM BrCCl3, or the two combined, BrCCl3/BHP-potentiated lipid
peroxidation and hemolysis were further enhanced under anaerobic
conditions. However, the potentiation of lipid peroxidation was
abolished by heating or trypsin digestion of rRBC. Electron spin
resonance (ESR) studies demonstrated an increase of alkoxyl radical
induced by BrCCl3/BHP in rRBC, and this increase was abolished by
heating or predigestion of hemolysates with trypsin. The inhibition of
lipid peroxidation by diphenylamine (which reacts with alkoxyl radicals
but not peroxyl radicals) suggests an important role of alkoxyl
radicals. Overall, the present findings demonstrate that the increase in
radical-related oxidative damage, possibly mediated by proteinlike
materials, may be at least partially responsible for the potentiation of
damage to rRBC induced by BrCCl3/BHP, and perhaps by BrCCl3. Although
the in vivo significance of these results remains to be investigated, it
seems likely that halocarbon toxicity may be amplified by elevated
levels of lipid peroxide in blood.}},

	abstract = {{The different production of phosgene and free-radicals from CHCl3 and
CCl4 was determined in vitro and in vivo, by measuring the
regioselective binding of the two intermediates to phospholipid (PL)
molecules. Results clearly indicated that this assay can be successfully
used to selectively detect electrophilic and radicalic metabolites
produced in vivo and selectively quantitate their adducts. The in vivo
biotransformation of CCl4, similarly to the in vitro situation, resulted
in the formation of radicals only, the contribution of phosgene to the
structural damage of PL being negligible. These findings allowed us to
rule out the hypothesis of substantial formation of radicalic
intermediates from CHCl3 in phenobarbital (PB)-pretreated Sprague-Dawley
(SD) rats, derived from in vitro data. While the role of reduced
glutathione (GSH) in preventing COCl2-derived damages seems to be less
important in vivo than in vitro, it is not possible to rule out the
action of radical scavenging systems in decreasing the level of adducts
with fatty acyl chains (FC) of PL measured in vivo.}},

	abstract = {{The reactions of 1,3-dimethyl-4-imidazolin-2-selone, 1, and
1,2-bis(3-methyl-4-imidazolin-2-selone)ethane, 3, with I2 give rise to
the new stable hypervalent 10-Se-3 compounds: 
1,3-dimethyl-4-imidazolin-2-ylium diiodo selenanide, I, and
1,2-bis(3-methyl-4-imidazolin-2-ylium diiodo selenanide)ethane
bis(dichloromethane), III, characterized by the linear I-Se-I
arrangement.  Crystals of I are monoclinic {[}a = 12.648(6), b =
10.084(6), c = 8.624(7) angstrom; beta = 97.08(2)-degrees; Z = 4; space
group P2(1)/c; R = 0.0393].  Crystals of III are monoclinic {[}a =
16.737(6), b = 8.286(7), c = 19.755(6) angstrom; beta =
98.68(2)-degrees; Z = 4; space group C2/c; R = 0.0305].  The
corresponding reaction using
1,1'-bis(3-methyl-4-imidazolin-2-selone)methane, 2, produces instead the
adduct 1,1'-bis(3-methyl-4-imidazolin-2-selone) methane bis(diiodine),
II, where two linear Se-I-I groups are present.  Crystals of II are
monoclinic {[}a = 16.144(2), b = 10.825(2), c = 23.196(4) angstrom; beta
= 111.14(1)-degrees; Z = 8; space group C2/c; R = 0.0427].  The Se-I
distances in II are comparable with those found in I and III, and the
I-I distances are close to the mean value found in triiodides. 
Analogously to the I-Se-I and I-I-I- cases, a three centre-two electron
(3c-2e) axial orbital deficient bonding scheme is proposed to describe
the bonding in the triatomic Se-I-I linear group.  Electronic spectra of
II agree with the proposed MO scheme better than with the
Charge-Transfer complex description.  FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of I,
II and III show that Se-I-I and I-Se-I groups give rise to vibrational
bands at very similar frequencies and moreover they fall very close to
those found for several asymmetric triiodides.  These results indicate
that both the electronic and vibrational spectra cannot be conclusive
for the identification of the products.  Moreover, the reported results
show that in the reaction of diiodine with similar selenoamidic donors,
no predictable products are obtained.}},

1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (phen),
alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl(2,2'-bipyridine) (bipy) or trioctyl-phosphine
oxide (TOPO) is described. The enhancement of the extraction by addition
of such neutral adductants is explained in terms of adduct formation of
the metal chelate in the organic phase. Among the three synergistic
mixtures, 1,10-phenanthroline is the most promising for the extraction
of the last member of light lanthanoids, gadolinium. Gadolinium irons
are found to be extracted in the absence of phen, bipy or TOPO; the
species was M(HA(2))(3) but M(HA(2))(3)(phen)(2) was found when phen was
added and M(Ha(2))(3)(bipy), M(HA(2))(3)(bipy)(2) was found when bipy
was added and M(HA(2))(3)(TOPO) was found when TOPO was added. The
compositions of the extracted species are obtained from the slope
analysis method. pH(1/2) values were also obtained. The stoichiometry,
extraction constants and stability constants of these systems were
determined. Synergistic extraction can be carried out at lower pH.}},

	abstract = {{The use of the dynamic pendant drop method has permitted the
accumulation of information in real time on the kinetic and theological
processes that accompany the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) at
the dichloromethane (DCM)/water interface in the presence and in the
absence of poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA50). These results have been compared
with those obtained at the air/water interface. The study of the
adsorption kinetics of BSA at the DCM/water and air/water interfaces has
shown that the adsorption process was diffusion controlled in both cases
for relatively low concentrations of protein (0.005 g/L) In the presence
of PLA50, the adsorption of BSA at the DCM/water interface led to a
mixed interfacial layer. The mechanism of the formation of this mixed
interface involves the penetration of BSA into the saturated layer of
PLA50 with the displacement and condensation of the PLA50 segments. In
all cases, theological results indicated a pure elastic behavior for the
mixed BSA/PLA50 interfacial layers. The absence of relaxation upon the
application of dilatational stress was attributed to the instantaneous
displacement of the PLA50 segments and the nonexpulsion of the BSA
segments. These results are interpreted with respect to the preparation
of biodegradable PLA50 microparticles related to an emulsion-based
process.}},

produced in rat liver microsomal dispersions that had been treated with

system and BrCCl3 (or CCl4). In the identification of PBN spin adducts,
a scan of precursors of m/z 57 was utilized to confirm the presence of
PBN spin adducts, because PBN spin adducts produce m/z 57 from
tert-butyl as a characteristic fragment. Use of deuterated PBN (PBN-d(9)
deuterated at tert-butyl; PBN-d(14) deuterated at both phenyl and
tert-butyl) improved the recognition of PBN adducts in mixtures by
precursor ion scans, because m/z 66 (which corresponds to the deuterated
tert-butyl group) is characteristic and, unlike m/z 57, it is not a
common fragment for any other compounds. Two new PBN spin adducts that
were not detected before by electron paramagnetic resonance or mass
spectrometry were identified by these methods for the first time.}},

@article{ISI:A1996TY42100001,
	abstract = {{Chlorination is a widely used method for disinfection of drinking water
supplies. Reaction of chlorine with naturally present organic compounds
con result in toxic by-products. One major disinfection byproduct from
the chlorination of drinking water is dichloroacetic acid (DCA). This
chemical has been shown to be carcinogenic in rodents, yet little
genotoxicity data are available to assess the possible role of DNA
and/or chromosomol damage in this process. We have used the peripheral
blood erythrocyte micronucleus (MN) assay and the alkaline single cell
gel electrophoresis (SCG) technique to investigate the in vivo
genotoxicity of DCA in bone marrow and blood leukocytes, respectively.
The MN assay detects chromosome breakage and/or malsegregation, while
the SCG assay detects DNA damage (e.g., single strand breaks,
alkali-labile sites, crosslinking). Mice were exposed to this compound
in drinking water, available ad libitum, for vp to 31 weeks. Our results
show a smell but statistically significant dose-related increase in the
frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) after
subchronic exposure to DCA for 9 days. In addition, at the highest dose
of DCA tested (3.5 g/l), a small but significant increase in the
frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) was
detected following exposure for greater than or equal to 10 weeks.
Coadministration of the antioxidant vitamin E did not affect the ability
of DCA to induce this damage, indicating that the small induction of MN
by DCA was probably not due to oxidative damage. Based on the lock of
any difference observed in the proportion of kinetochore-positive
micronuclei between the treated and control animals, we interpret the
induced MN as arising from clastogenic events. The SCG technique
suggested the presence of DNA crosslinking in blood leukocytes in mice
exposed to 3.5 g/l DCA for 28 days. These data provide evidence that DCA
may be an extremely weak inducer of chromosome damage when provided to
mice in drinking water under conditions which lead to increased levels
of tumors. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.{*}}},

evaluated by precipitation of plasma proteins with cold ethanol. The
method was compared with the routinely used plasma ultrafiltration and
with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) protein precipitation. After incubation
of human plasma samples with cisplatin or carboplatin, unbound platinum
concentrations were determined applying Amicon Diaflo ultrafiltration
membranes and Millipore ultra-free-MC filters. For protein
precipitation, 1 ml of cold (-20 degrees C) pure ethanol was added to
0.5 ml of human plasma and the supernatant was collected after 2 h, or
0.5 ml of cold 20\% TCA was added to 0.5 mi of plasma. Platinum was
analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). There was no
significant difference between the ethanol and ultrafiltration methods
in the unbound platinum concentration. The protein content in the
supernatant (1.00 +/- 0.20\%) was slightly higher than that in the
Amicon (0.58 +/- 0.05\%) and Millipore (0.55 +/- 0.04\%) ultrafiltrates.
On average, the TCA and ethanol method seemed to be equally appropriate.
The ethanol precipitation method is concluded to be simple, convenient,
and reproducible and has negligible costs.}},

@article{ISI:A1996VM55600019,
	abstract = {{The abilities of GeneReleaser and QIAamp to extract the hepatitis B
virus (HBV) DNA template from serum for amplification by PCR were
evaluated and compared with that of the standard phenol-chloroform
method, Differences in the sensitivities of the three methods were
revealed by nested PCR of HBV DNA extracted from serially diluted
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive (high-titer) serum,
Phenol-chloroform was found to be the most sensitive extraction method
but was time-consuming and labor intensive, and the many steps required
increased the possibility of contamination, In a titration of
HBeAg-negative (low-titer) serum, all three methods coupled with nested
PCR were capable of detecting low levels of HBV DNA. In the case of
QIAamp and GeneReleaser, the extraction,vas relatively simple and rapid.
The higher quantity of serum (200 mu l) used in the QIAamp extraction
did not provide higher sensitivity, possibly because of incomplete
removal of Taq polymerase inhibitors from the serum or inadequate
disruption of the virion, GeneReleaser was more efficient because it
gave the same detection limit in low-titer serum as phenol-chloroform
even though it utilizes only 5 mu l of serum. However, it did not
produce consistent amplifications of HBV DNA, giving false-negative
results in 7 of the 50 cases (14\%) in one experiment. Use of a larger
volume of serum and replicate extractions may overcome this problem,
Advantages thus exist in each of the extraction methods, and these
should be weighed against the disadvantages when deciding which
extraction method is appropriate.}},

@article{ISI:A1996VU84300029,
	abstract = {{We have comparatively studied in vitro the oxidative and reductive
pathways of chloroform metabolism in hepatic and renal microsomes of
rodent strains used for carcinogenicity testing (B6C3F1 mice, Osborne
Mendel and Sprague Dawley rats). To this aim we exploited the
regioselective binding of phosgene to phospholipid (PL) polar heads and
of dichloromethyl radical to PL fatty acyl chains, using a method based
on the chemical transmethylation of PL adducts, followed by phase
partitioning of the resulting products (De Biasi et al., 1992). The
analysis of results let us to conclude at first that a C-14 label
partitioning by 89.2 (+/- 6.5)\% or 13.7 (+/- 5.0)\% in the aqueous
phase is typical of the pi, adduct with phosgene (PL-PHOS) or with
dichloromethyl radical (PL-RAD), respectively. Metabolism of 0.1 mM
CHCl3 was mainly oxidative in all the samples, being hepatic microsomes
more active than renal ones by about one order of magnitude and levels
of CHCl3-derived PL adducts in B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes higher than
in rat samples. At 5 mM CHCl3, total levels of PL adducts in renal
microsomes reached levels almost similar to those found in liver
microsomes. However, while B6C3F1 mouse kidney microsomes produced both
reactive metabolites, similarly as the hepatic samples, Osborne Mendel
rat kidney microsomes bioactivated CHCl3 only reductively, producing the
radical. The relevance of this finding depends on the fact that phosgene
is known to be the major cause of CHCl3 toxicity, based on data with the
rat liver and mouse liver and kidney, while nephrotoxicity in rats
occurs with minimal production of COCl2. Chloroform reductive
bioactivation may therefore provide a reasonable explanation for the
toxicity of chloroform to the rat kidney. The same finding may be of
interest in elucidating the metabolic reasons of the chloroform-induced
kidney tumors in Osborne Mendel rats.}},

	abstract = {{Renal injury is a common side-effect of the chemotherapeutic agent
ifosfamide. Current evidence suggests that the ifosfamide metabolite
chloroacetaldehyde may be responsible for this nephrotoxicity. The
present study examined the effect of increasing amounts of intrarenally
infused chloroacetaldehyde on kidney function, glutathione content and
malondialdehyde formation. The ability of the uroprotectant medication
sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (mesna) to prevent
chloroacetaldehyde-induced renal injury was also assessed. Intrarenal
chloroacetaldehyde infusion caused dose-dependent declines in glomerular
filtration rate and p-aminohippuric acid clearance and increases in
urine how rate, sodium, glucose and protein excretion. These
abnormalities were associated with progressive kidney glutathione
depletion and malondialdehyde accumulation. Mesna infusion did not
affect renal function but did cause a significant fall in kidney
glutathione content. Simultaneous administration of chloroacetaldehyde
and mesna only partially corrected renal functional abnormalities and
prevented malondialdehyde accumulation but not glutathione depletion.
These results show that the ifosfamide metabolite chloroacetaldehyde
causes kidney dysfunction, glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation
in vivo. Mesna provides limited protection against chloroacetaldehyde
nephrotoxicity, potentially explaining its inability to completely
prevent ifosfamide-related renal injury in clinical practice. (C) 1996

	abstract = {{Existing information on human exposure to chloroform and other
trihalomethanes (THMs) in air, water, and food is summarized. Three
major surveys have collected data on chloroform levels in finished water
at treatment plants. EPA's TEAM Studies have measured concentrations of
THMs in residential drinking water and in personal, indoor, outdoor, and
expired air from about 800 participants in eight cities. The Food and
Drug Administration has surveyed chloroform levels in food and
beverages. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have
completed measuring blood levels of THMs in about 1000 participants in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Exposure occurs through ingestion (drinking tap water and soft drinks
and eating certain dairy foods), inhalation (breathing peak amounts of
chloroform emitted during showers or baths, and lower levels in indoor
air from other indoor sources), and dermal absorption (during showers,
baths, and swimming). Each of these routes of exposure appear to be
potentially substantial contributors to total exposure.
The major source of exposure to chloroform is chlorination of water
supplies. This results in exposure through ingestion of drinking water,
but also through inhalation and skin absorption as a result of the
myriad other uses of chlorinated water in the home: showers, baths,
washing clothes and dishes, etc. Because chlorinated water supplies are
used by bottling plants of soft drink manufacturers, even the chloroform
found in beverages may be partially due to the chlorination of water
supplies. Other sources of exposure, which can be important for specific
groups of people, include chlorination of swimming pools, industrial
production and use, and use of bleach during clothes washing.}},

	abstract = {{Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is a metabolite of trichloroethylene (TRI)
thought to contribute to its hepatocarcinogenic effects in mice. Recent
studies have shown that peak blood concentrations of TCA do not occur
until similar to 12 hr after an oral dose of TRI; however, blood
concentrations of TRI reach a maximum within 1 hr and is nondetectable
after 2 hr. The objective of this study was to examine quantitatively
enterohepatic recirculation of trichloroethanol (TCEOH) and TCA as a
possible mechanism responsible for the delayed production of TCA.
Jugular vein, duodenum, and bile duct-cannulated Fischer 344 rats were
used, with the collection of blood, bile, urine, and feces samples after
intraduodenal and intravenous dosing of animals with TRI, TCEOH, and
TCA. Samples were analyzed by GC for TCA, total TCEOH, and free TCEOH.
The results show that, after an intravenous dose of TCEOH (100 mg/kg),
36\% of the TCEOH in brood is attributable to enterohepatic
recirculation. With the same treatment, 76\% of the TCA in blood is
attributable to enterohepatic recirculation of metabolites. Peak
concentrations of total TCEOH in bile, after an intraduodenal dose of
TRI, are over 5 times higher than peak concentrations of total TCEOH in
systemic blood. Peak concentrations of TCEOH glucuronide in bile are
similar to 200 times higher than peak concentrations of TCEOH
glucuronide in systemic blood.}},

	abstract = {{The effects of the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 on the biphasic
induced CD spectra of bilirubin complexes of human and bovine serum
albumins (HSA and BSA) are divergent. While Triton X-100 inverts the
induced CD spectrum of HSA . bilirubin, this surfactant enhances the
ellipticity values of induced CD of BSA. bilirubin without inversion.
The effect of Triton X-100 on the characteristic ultraviolet-CD spectra
of the albumins are similar; both the albumins are denatured from their
native globular structures. The anionic surfactant SDS, unlike non-ionic
Triton X-100, dislodges the ligand from its protein complexes,
indicating that both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces are involved
in binding of bilirubin to the albumins.
The aprotic solvent chloroform inverts the biphasic induced CD spectra
of HSA. bilirubin and BSA . bilirubin, whereas CHCl3 has relatively
little effect an the ultraviolet CD spectra of the albumins. The
combined effect of Triton X-100 and CHCl3 shows that the effect of CHCl3
predominates over that of Triton X-100. The perturbing effects of Triton
X-100 and CHCl3 on the CD or induced CD spectra of the proteins or their
bilirubin complexes are reversible, and independent of the order in
which components were added. The observations suggest that the
denaturation of the albumins by Triton X-100 or solvation of CHCl3
within albumins markedly alter the internal topography or dynamics of
the receptor sites, triggering alterations of the chirality of the bound
pigment in sign and/or magnitude.}},

	abstract = {{Bromate is a disinfection by product (DBP) in drinking water that is
formed during the ozonation of a source water containing bromide.
Brominated haloacetic acids are DBPs that are anions at near-neutral
pHs. The anion character of bromoacetic acid (pK(a) = 2.7) is similar to
bromate, which causes the two species to coelute when NaOH is used as an
eluent. Four columns are evaluated as a means of removing the potential
false positives generated by bromoacetic acid. The alkyl quaternary
amine based PA-100 guard column separates bromate from bromoacetic acid
using 100 mM NaOH, hut the analysis time is greater than 12 min. The use
of 5 mM HNO3 as an eluent (with the PA-100) provides adequate separation
of bromate from bromoacetic acid with an analysis time of less than 8
min. The stability of bromate in 5 mM HNO3 was evaluated using a DDI
matrix (pH adjusted to 5.5, fortified with bromide) and a drinking water
matrix (pH 4-9). The bromate recoveries in these two matrices were
93-105\% with less than 4\% RSDs. Tribromoacetic acid produces a broad
peak that envelops the retention window of bromate. The tribromoacetic
acid was removed using a reverse-phase sample pretreatment cartridge.
The overall analysis procedure was evaluated in a synthetic chloride,
sulfate, and nitrate matrix. In addition, precision and recovery data
were collected from five ozonated drinking waters. The percent
recoveries in the ozonated waters ranged from 90 to 98\% with RSDs of
less than 6\%. The method detection limit for bromate is 0.8 mu g/l.}},

	abstract = {{Alveolar breath sampling was used to assess trihalomethane (THM)
exposures encountered by collegiate swimmers during a typical 2-hr
training period in an indoor natatorium. The breath samples were
collected at regular intervals before, during, and for 3 hr after a
moderately intense training workout. Integrated and grab whole-air
samples were collected during the training period to help determine
inhalation exposures, and pool water samples were collected to help
assess dermal exposures. Resulting breath samples collected during the
workout demonstrated a rapid uptake of two THMs (chloroform and
bromodichloromethane), with chloroform concentrations exceeding the
natatorium air levels within 8 min after the exposure began. Chloroform
levels continued to rise steeply until they were more than two times the
indoor levels, providing evidence that the dermal route of exposure was
relatively rapid and ultimately more important than the inhalation route
in this training scenario. Chloroform elimination after the exposure
period was fitted to a three compartment model that allowed estimation
of compartmental half-lives, resulting minimum bloodborne dose, and an
approximation of the duration of elevated body burdens. We estimated the
dermal exposure route to account for 80\% of the blood chloroform
concentration and the transdermal diffusion efficiency from the water to
the blood to in excess of 2\%. Bromodichloromethane elimination was
fitted to a two compartment model, which provided evidence of a small,
but measurable, body burden of this THM resulting from vigorous swim
training. These results suggest that trihalomethane exposures for
competitive swimmers under prolonged, high-effort training are common
and possibly higher than was previously thought and that the dermal
exposure route is dominant. The exposures and potential risks associated
with this common recreational activity should be more thoroughly
investigated.}},

	abstract = {{Effects of single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4), chloroform (CHCl3), and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2)
on lipoproteins in plasma and liver were investigated in rats. Changes
in lipoproteins caused by these solvents were compared with changes in
traditional hepatotoxicity markers such as GPT (ALT). Following the
administration, concentrations of lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL),
triglyceride, cholesterol, and GPT activity in plasma were determined
through changes in liver weight, liver content of triglyceride, malon
dialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH). Time-course study revealed that
changes in plasma and liver reached their peaks at 19 or 32 hr following
the administration of CCl4 or CHCl3. Peaks of changes were observed at 8
or 19 hr following the administration of CH2Cl2. Dose dependency of
these changes was investigated at dosages of 3, 30, and 300 mg/kg of
CCl4 or CHCl3, and 300, and 1,000 mg/kg of CE2Cl2. Significant decreases
in triglyceride and apolipoproteins in VLDL fraction were observed at 3
mg/kg of CCl4. Such VLDL components decreased at 30 mg/kg of CHCl3. HDL
decreased significantly at 300 mg/kg of CH2Cl2 and marked increase in
LDL occurred at 1,000 mg/kg of the solvent. Liver weight and liver
content of triglyceride and MDA significantly increased at 30 mg/kg of
CCl4, while significant increase in GPT activity was observed at 300
mg/kg of CCl4 and CHCl3. GPT increased significantly at 1,000 mg/kg of
CH2Cl2. These results revealed that changes in plasma lipoproteins can
serve as sensitive and simple markers for liver disorders caused by
chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as CCl4, CHCl3, or CH2Cl2.}},

	abstract = {{A new and sensitive gas chromatography (GC) method for measurement of
chloroform or methylene chloride in whole blood is presented. Trace
levels of these analytes present in the headspace of samples were
cryogenically trapped prior to on-line GC analysis. After heating of a
blood sample containing chloroform and methylene chloride (internal
standard, and vice versa) in a 7.0-mL vial at 55 degrees C for 20 min, 5
mL of the headspace vapor was drawn into a glass syringe. All vapor was
introduced into an Rtx-Volatiles middle-bore capillary column in the
splitless mode at -30 degrees C oven temperature to trap the entire
analytes, and the oven temperature was programmed up to 280 degrees C
for detection of the compounds and for cleaning of the column. The
present conditions gave sharp peaks for both chloroform and methylene
chloride and very low background noises for whole blood samples. As much
as 11.5 and 20.0\% of chloroform and methylene chloride, respectively,
which had been added to whole blood in a vial, could be introduced into
the GC column. The calibration curves showed linearity in the range of
0.05-5.0 mu g/0.5 mL of whole blood. The detection limit was estimated
to be about 2 ng/0.5 mL. The coefficients of intraday and interday
variations were 1.31 and 8.90\% for chloroform and 1.37 and 9.03\% for
methylene chloride, respectively. The data on chloroform or methylene
chloride in rat blood after inhalation of each compound were also
presented.}},
