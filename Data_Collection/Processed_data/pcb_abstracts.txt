12775040	Recently, there has been an increase in studies focusing on an emerging class of organic contaminants, hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) and chlorinated phenolic compounds (CPCs) in the environment, particularly in northern regions of Europe and Canada. Since information for fish from the Great Lakes are scarce, we determined the blood plasma concentrations of OH-PCB congeners, pentachlorophenol (PCP), 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol (TCP), and 4-hydroxyheptachlorostyrene (4-OH-HpCS) for lake trout (Savelinus namaycush) collected from two of the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario and Lake Superior, and two regional lakes, Lake Champlain and Lake Opeongo. PCP was the dominant CPC in lake trout (105-658 pg/g of plasma). Detectable concentrations of 2,3,4,5-TCP and 4-OH-HpCS were found in all lake trout (2.6-101 and 0.4-27 pg/g, respectively). Highest concentrations were found in trout from Lake Ontario and Lake Superior. Sixteen OH-PCBs were quantified, with 4-OH-CB187 having the highest concentration in all samples (10-173 pg/g of plasma). Unexpectedly, highly chlorinated OH-PCBs such as 4'-OH-CB199 (mean 21.4 and 74.4 pg/g), 4,4'-diOH-CB202 (18.3 and 27.7 pg/g), and 4'-OH-CB208 (24.5 and 34.7 pg/g) were found in lake trout from Lake Ontario and Lake Superior, respectively. Future studies to delineate the sources and impacts of CPCs in the Great Lakes catchment are needed.
9697965	Behavioral impairment as a consequence of PCB exposure beginning in utero has been reported in both humans and animals. The present study assessed the behavioral consequences of postnatal exposure to PCBs. Male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were dosed from birth to 20 weeks of age with 7.5 microg/kg/ day of a PCB mixture representative of the PCBs typically found in human breast milk (eight monkeys) or vehicle (four monkeys). Blood PCB levels at 20 weeks of age were 0.30-0.37 ppb for control and 1.84-2.84 ppb for treated monkeys, and fat levels were 50-198 and 1694-3560 ppb for the two groups, respectively. At about 4.5-5.0 years of age, monkeys performed on a series of three spatial discrimination reversal tasks, followed by a differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) 30-s schedule of reinforcement. There were no differences between groups for the number of errors across reversals for any of the discrimination reversal tasks, whereas the PCB-treated group tended to have shorter median response latencies than the control group. On the DRL schedule, there were robust differences in performance between the treated and control groups. Treated monkeys displayed shorter mean and median interresponse times (IRTs), obtained fewer reinforcements, and emitted more nonreinforced responses. The treated groups also had more short IRTs (< or =10 s) than control monkeys. Performance of the treated group did not improve to control levels over the 51 sessions of the DRL 30-s schedule; their performance remained much less efficient than that of controls. The results of this study extend previous research in this cohort of monkeys, and provide further evidence that PCB exposure limited to the early postnatal period and resulting in environmentally relevant body burdens produces long-term behavioral effects.
16337987	In the present study, non-ortho, mono-ortho and other ortho-substituted PCB congeners were analysed in individual blood serum samples taken from healthy adults (196 males and 119 females) in the polluted area of the Michalovce district and in the background area of the Stropkov/Svidnik districts in Eastern Slovakia by high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The samples from general population living in villages and towns of two regions were taken between August 2001 and February 2002 within the project of the EC's 5th Framework Programme (PCBRISK, ). The medians of dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs)--expressed as TEQs on lipid basis--of all males (24.7 pg g(-1) lipid) and females (21.4 pg g(-1) lipid) were comparable, but there was a significant difference between both of the areas studied. In the district of Michalovce, the medians of males (47.3 pg g(-1) lipid) and females (41.1 pg g(-1) lipid) were 2.3 times higher than in the area of the Stropkov/Svidnik districts. The medians of total non-dioxin-like PCB concentration were 1,835 and 1,033 ng g(-1) lipid in males and females, respectively. The data show a trend toward higher concentrations of both dl- and non-dioxin-like PCBs in the older age groups. The substantial increase was observed for the 60+ age group. PCB-126 was the most abundant non-ortho congener. PCBs-118 and 156 were the predominant mono-ortho congeners. They were quantitated in all samples analysed. Congeners 153, 138(+163), 180 and 170(+190) were the main contributors to total non-dioxin-like PCB concentrations. Mean mutual ratio HexaCBs:HeptaCBs:OctaCBs in the non-dioxin-like group was 37:50:1. The results of this study represent the overall information about the congener distribution of dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs in human serum blood of adult Slovaks.
3921368	Individual blood samples obtained from yusho and yu-cheng patients who had been poisoned by ingesting contaminated cooking oils, from workers occupationally exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and from unexposed individuals were analyzed for PCBs, polychlorinated quaterphenyls (PCQs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. PCBs were found in the blood of all samples. PCQs were detected in the blood of 54 of 56 living yusho patients 11 years after the outbreak, and in all yu-cheng patients 6 months following poisoning. These facts indicate that the presence of PCQs in the blood was a good mark of past ingestion of the toxic oil. In the yu-cheng cases, PCDFs as well as PCBs and PCQs were detected in all blood samples. These identified isomers have been reported to be remarkably highly toxic compounds, i.e., both the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated and 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorinated compounds are toxicologically hundreds to thousands of times more toxic than PCB. In view of the high toxicity of PCDFs found in the yu-cheng patients' blood, we must deduce that they are the primary causal agents of yusho as well as of the yu-cheng incident.
7510429	Female F344/NCr rats were exposed continuously (7-84 days) or discontinuously (7 days exposure/21 days control diet or 28 days exposure/56 days control diet) to various dietary concentrations (1-100 ppm) of Aroclor 1254. There were dose- and time-dependent increases in PCB levels in liver, blood, and adipose tissue. Following removal of the rats from diet containing Aroclor 1254, there was a relatively rapid decrease in PCB levels, particularly in rats exposed to higher concentrations of Aroclor 1254. In parallel with the alterations in PCB levels observed, the rats showed striking dose- and time-dependent increases in hepatic levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, as determined by various methods [RNA analysis, immunochemical detection, or measurement of the O-dealkylation of methoxyresorufin (CYP1A2) or ethoxyresorufin (CYP1A1)]. In rats removed from the Aroclor 1254 diet, catalytic activity for CYP1A1 as well as RNA levels for both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 rapidly diminished. In contrast to the high levels of induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 observed, limited induction (< 5-fold) of epoxide hydrolase, quinone oxidoreductase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase was detected, even in rats exposed to the highest concentration of Aroclor (100 ppm) for up to 84 days. Furthermore, induction of these non-CYP hepatic drug-metabolizing genes exhibited distinctly different concentration-response curves. The ratios of hepatic CYP1A1 activity to hepatic PCB burden were similar for rats exposed continuously to Aroclor in the diet for 7, 28, or 84 days, and for rats exposed discontinuously (7 days Aroclor/21 days control diet or 28 days Aroclor/56 days control diet). Thus, hepatic PCB levels alone appeared to be reasonably predictive of CYP1A1 levels under a variety of modes of exposure. When the ratio of CYP1A1 activity to adipose or blood PCB concentration was determined, similar ratios were observed for rats exposed continuously for 7, 28, or 84 days. However, lower ratios were observed for rats discontinuously exposed to Aroclor in the diet. These results have important implications with respect to: (a) employing PCB levels in various tissues to predict biological effects, and (b) determining different concentration-response curves for the various biological effects induced by PCBs.
22750796	In order to establish a national baseline estimate of the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Canadians, pooling of individual human sera was performed to ensure that a high frequency of detectable concentrations of analytes would be achieved. Nearly 5000 (4583) sera samples from Cycle 1 of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) collected between 2007 and 2009 were used to form 59 composite pools of approximately 25 mL each. Pools were categorized by sex and age with participants ranging from 6 to 79 years. The pooled samples were analysed for 17 PCDD/Fs and 36 PCB congeners, and from these data, total toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQ(2005 PCDD/F+Dioxin-like [DL]-PCB)) were estimated. The average 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) concentration was <1 pg g⁻¹ on a lipid extractable basis. The average total TEQ(2005 PCDD/F+DL-PCB) was 11 pg TEQ g⁻¹ lipid and average ΣPCB concentrations were about 100 ng g⁻¹ lipid. Sex did not affect the concentrations, while PCB and PCDD/F concentrations were positively correlated with age (p<0.001). It appeared in some cases that the age group 6-11 years had higher concentrations of these persistent organic pollutants (POPs) than the concentrations observed in 12-19 year olds, however, the results were not statistically significant based on pair-wise comparisons. Concentration levels and patterns observed in this study of Canadians were similar to those reported in the US and European populations.
15089092	Polychlorinated biphenyls are wide pollutants readily detected in environmental and human specimens. DNA adduction occurs through the corresponding quinones. Polychlorinated biphenyls are first metabolized to arene oxides, which can be further oxidized to dihydroxy metabolites by microsomal cytochrome p450s. The catechol and hydroquinone products are further oxidized by peroxidases to quinones, which are electrophilic and capable of reacting with DNA to form adducts. DNA adduction is initiated by Michael addition preferentially to guanosine followed by stabilization through enolization. Another nucleophilic attack forms a five-membered ring, which aromatizes by dehydration to form the final adduct. This report describes the characterization and quantitative study of DNA adducts formed from lower chlorinated PCB-derived quinones. Quantitative study by HPLC/ESI-MS/MS and (32)P-postlabeling-HPLC gave the adduct levels in the range of 3-1200 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides. These results demonstrate that increasing chlorine substitution is associated with lower yields of DNA adduct. Although (32)P-postlabeling is more sensitive than HPLC/ESI-MS/MS for the quantitative analysis of DNA adducts, modification levels were severely underestimated by the (32)P-postlabeling assay as compared to the HPLC/ESI-MS/MS assay.
10473895	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are ubiquitous carcinogenic and teratogenic compounds that are transplacentally transferred from mother to fetus during pregnancy. It was the aim of the present study to evaluate the possible influence of maternal age and duration of pregnancy on the neonatal burden with these substances. Blood samples were taken from 80 full-term German neonates within the first 12 h of life, before the first oral feeding. The serum concentrations of six PCB congeners (28, 52, 101, 138, 153, and 180) and HCB were determined with capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The concentrations of the lower chlorinated PCB congeners (28, 52, and 101) were below the detection limit. PCB 153 showed the highest serum concentration (median 0.42 microg/l), followed by PCB 138 (0. 34 microg/l) and PCB 180 (0.17 microg/l). Total PCB concentration was 0.96 microg/l, HCB concentration 0.61 microg/l. All detectable PCB congeners and the total PCB concentration correlated significantly with the gestational age of the newborns (r = 0.2639; p < 0.01), with 50-140% higher serum levels in children born at 42 weeks of gestation as compared with neonates born in the 38th week. HCB concentration correlated with maternal age (r = 0.249; p < 0.01), with 2.7-fold higher serum levels in offspring of 40-year-old as compared with 20-year-old women. It is concluded that the neonatal burden with organochlorine compounds depends on maternal age and duration of pregnancy, thereby reflecting the increase in body pollution with these substances during human life as well as a continuous transplacental transfer from mother to fetus during pregnancy.
15734276	The aim of this study was to examine the effects of prenatal and postnatal chronic exposure to mercury (Hg), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead (Pb) on the neuromotor development of preschool children. The study population consisted of 110 preschool Inuit children from Nunavik (Canada). Blood Hg, PCBs and Pb concentrations were measured at birth (cord blood) and at the time of testing. Gross motor functions were evaluated and a neurological examination was performed. Fine neuromotor performance was assessed using quantitative measures of postural hand tremor, reaction time, sway oscillations, as well as alternating and pointing movements. Potential covariates were documented including demographic and familial characteristics, other prenatal neurotoxicants (alcohol, tobacco) and nutrients (selenium (Se), Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA)). Hierarchical multivariate regression analyses were performed, controlling for significant covariates. Gross motor development was not linked to prenatal exposures. However, significant associations were observed between blood Pb concentration at testing time and changes in reaction time, sway oscillations, alternating arm movements and action tremor. For some of these outcomes, neuromotor effects of Pb exposure are observed at blood concentrations below 10 microg/dl. Negative effects of PCBs on neuromotor development were not clearly observed, neither were the potential beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA and selenium. Tremor amplitude was related to blood Hg concentrations at testing time, which corroborate an effect already reported among adults.
21668970	BACKGROUND: PCB contamination in the built environment may result from the release of PCBs from building materials. The significance of this contamination as a pathway of human exposure is not well-characterized, however. This research compared the serum PCB concentrations, and congener profiles between 18 teachers in PCB-containing schools and referent populations. METHODS: Blood samples from 18 teachers in PCB-containing schools were analyzed for 57 PCB congeners. Serum PCB concentrations and congener patterns were compared between the teachers, to the 2003-4 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data, and to data from 358 Greater Boston area men. RESULTS: Teachers at one school had higher levels of lighter (PCB 6-74) congeners compared to teachers from other schools. PCB congener 47 contributed substantially to these elevated levels. Older teachers (ages 50-64) from all schools had higher total (sum of 33 congeners) serum PCB concentrations than age-comparable NHANES reference values. Comparing the teachers to the referent population of men from the Greater Boston area (all under age 51), no difference in total serum PCB levels was observed between the referents and teachers up to 50 years age. However, the teachers had significantly elevated serum concentrations of lighter congeners (PCB 6-74). This difference was confirmed by comparing the congener-specific ratios between groups, and principal component analysis showed that the relative contribution of lighter congeners differed between the teachers and the referents. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the teachers in the PCB-containing buildings had higher serum levels of lighter PCB congeners (PCB 6-74) than the referent populations. Examination of the patterns, as well as concentrations of individual PCB congeners in serum is essential to investigating the contributions from potential environmental sources of PCB exposure. 
16130963	The authors examined the association between maternal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in Mexican American women with NTD-affected pregnancies who resided in the 14 Texas-Mexico border counties during 1995-2000 (cases). Controls were randomly selected from study area women delivering normal live births. For PCB congeners with sufficient numbers of detectable values (PCB 99, 101, 110, 118, 138, 153, 180), there was little association between the proportions with detectable PCB levels in cases and controls. Odds ratios were <1 or compatible with the null, but power was low for some congeners. An index of seven PCB congeners (105, 118, 138, 153, 170, 180, 194) was also not associated with NTD risk. The maternal serum PCB levels in this study population (median PCB 153 level: 18 ng/g) were comparable to those with background exposure and do not appear to have contributed to the high prevalence of NTDs in this population.
23053646	Discrete windows of susceptibility to toxicants have been identified for the breast, including in utero, puberty, pregnancy, and postpartum. We tested the hypothesis that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) measured during the early postpartum predict increased risk of maternal breast cancer diagnosed before age 50. We analyzed archived early postpartum serum samples collected from 1959 to 1967, an average of 17 years before diagnosis (mean diagnosis age 43 years) for 16 PCB congeners in a nested case-control study in the Child Health and Development Studies cohort (N = 112 cases matched to controls on birth year). We used conditional logistic regression to adjust for lipids, race, year, lactation, and body mass. We observed strong breast cancer associations with three congeners. PCB 167 was associated with a lower risk (odds ratio (OR), 75th vs. 25th percentile = 0.2, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0.1, 0.8) as was PCB 187 (OR, 75th vs. 25th percentile = 0.4, 95 % CI 0.1, 1.1). In contrast, PCB 203 was associated with a sixfold increased risk (OR, 75th vs. 25th percentile = 6.3, 95 % CI 1.9, 21.7). The net association of PCB exposure, estimated by a post-hoc score, was nearly a threefold increase in risk (OR, 75th vs. 25th percentile = 2.8, 95 % CI 1.1, 7.1) among women with a higher proportion of PCB 203 in relation to the sum of PCBs 167 and 187. Postpartum PCB exposure likely also represents pregnancy exposure, and may predict increased risk for early breast cancer depending on the mixture that represents internal dose. It remains unclear whether individual differences in exposure, response to exposure, or both explain risk patterns observed.
21480306	The most prevalent female cancer across the world is breast cancer. Current established breast cancer risk factors explain only a fraction of the breast cancer cases diagnosed, and for this reason, other environmental factors have been studied. Exposure to organochlorine compounds has been linked to an increased incidence of breast cancer, although not all data have been consistent. This study was designed to evaluate the relation between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) exposure and breast cancer risk in Mexican women. We recruited 140 women from the General Hospital. The cases were 70 newly diagnosed women. We collected environmental and reproductive information by questionnaire. Blood samples were taken for measurement of serum levels of 20 PCB congeners. Risk of breast cancer was found to be positively associated with heavy congeners, age, postmenopausal status, family history of breast cancer and living close to an industrial facility. When PCB were grouped by structure-activity relationships, the risk of breast cancer was positively associated with groups 2b (odds ratio, OR = 1.90, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.25-2.88), 3 (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.08-3.04) and group 4 (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.20-2.07). Among postmenopausal women, PCB levels from groups 1a, 2b, and 4 and total PCB were higher in cases, and an association between risk of breast cancer with groups 1a (OR = 7.59, 95% CI 1.1-51.4), 2b (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-11.2) and 4 (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1) was found in this group of women. This study showed an association between heavy and potentially estrogenic PCB congeners and breast cancer risk.
14659953	In a population-based cross-sectional study, we compared serum levels of 15 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and three organochlorine pesticides in residents of two districts in eastern Slovakia, one with extensive environmental contamination from a former PCB production site (Michalovce) and the other matched on geography but with low (background) levels (Svidnik). The age-adjusted geometric means for sum of 15 measured PCB congeners were statistically significantly higher in subjects from the Michalovce district for both sexes: 3327.6 versus 1331.4 ng/g of lipid in males, 2751.8 versus 992.2 ng/g of lipid in females. Levels of DDE and DDT were also significantly higher, although the absolute differences were less pronounced. There was no substantial difference in HCB levels between the districts. We also conducted an ecologic study to compare cancer incidence occurring in these same two districts from 1985 through 1994. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals for each district using indirect standardization and rates from eastern Slovakia. Among males from Michalovce (exposed), but not Svidnik (unexposed), there was an excess of cancer of the tongue (SIR=1.46; 1.06-1.96), stomach (SIR=1.15; 1.00-1.32), lung (SIR=1.14; 1.04-1.24), testis (SIR=1.40; 0.97-1.97), and kidney (SIR=1.23; 0.98-1.52), and lower than expected incidence of prostate cancer (SIR=0.83; 0.69-0.97); in contrast, there was an excess of peritoneal (SIR=3.05; 1.11-6.63) and laryngeal cancer (SIR=1.43; 0.99-1.98) in Svidnik not observed Michalovce. Among females from Michalovce, but not Svidnik, there was an excess of cancer of the lip (SIR=2.54; 1.53-3.96), stomach (SIR=1.22; 1.02-1.44), and lung (SIR=1.17; 0.94-1.45); in contrast, there was an excess of kidney (SIR=1.61; 1.03-2.40) and thyroid (SIR=1.97; 1.12-3.20) cancer in Svidnik not observed in Michalovce. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that high environmental exposure to organochlorines in the Michalovce district may be associated with higher rates of certain cancers, particularly stomach and lung cancer.
16182859	A chemical factory which produced polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) operated in Brescia, North Italy, (about 200000 inhabitants) from the 1930s to the 1980s. High levels of PCBs were recently found in soil, food and people living in an area close to the factory. We performed a survey among the general population living in non-polluted areas of the town in order to define the reference values (RVs) of the non-exposed population. A random sample of subjects aged 20-79 years (50% males) was selected. Participants underwent PCB determination and were interviewed on their residential and occupational history and current diet. For RV determination, subjects who had resided in the polluted area or consumed any food produced in the area in their lifetime were excluded. Eight hundred and ninety-two subjects were contacted, 579 (65%) of whom agreed to participate; 311 of them were considered for RV determination (53% male, mean age=48.7 years). Total PCB serum levels, computed as the sum of the 24 congeners determined, were: mean=5.15ng/ml (SD=8.83), median=4.11ng/ml, range=0.4-34.12ng/ml, 95th centile=14.38ng/ml. Lipid-adjusted mean and median were 897 and 705ng/g lipid, respectively. PCB values showed positive correlations with age (Spearman's r=0.76) and with serum concentration of total cholesterol (r=0.40) and triglycerides (r=0.36). No association was found with gender, cigarette smoking, alcohol or diet. Seven PCB congeners, (PCB 180, 153, 138, 170, 194, 118, and 156), including those at higher chlorination, were present in more than 30% of the subjects and contributed 99% of the total PCB levels, with a modest role of dioxin-like congeners.
15606145	The tissue distributions of persistent metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Wistar rats and homozygous uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) deficient Gunn rats exposed to 2,4,5,2',5'-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB101) and the commercial PCB mixture, Kanechlor-500 (KC500), were investigated. After exposure to CB101, four hydroxy and two methylsulfonyl (MeSO2) metabolites were detected in liver, lung, kidney, blood, and adipose tissues. One was identified as 3',4'-(OH)2-2,4,5,2',5'-pentaCB, which was retained selectively in the serum of Gunn rats. Comparative analysis of the metabolite profiles in both rat strains after exposure to KC500 showed higher formation ratios of several dihydroxy PCB metabolites in the liver of Gunn rats; major metabolites are the catechols from 2,5,3',4'-tetraCB, CB101, 2,3,6,3',4'-pentaCB, and 2,3,6,2',4',5'-pentaCB. Thus, Gunn rats effectively metabolized PCBs with 2,5- or 2,5,6-chlorine substitution to the 3,4-catechol, but less formed MeSO2 metabolites in the liver. Although both rat strains retained 4-OH-2,3,5,3',4'-pentaCB in serum, Gunn rats also retained the catechol PCBs, accounting for about 52% of the total phenolic PCBs. These results suggest that a lack of UGTs markedly alters the formation ratios and retention profiles of catechols and MeSO2 metabolites of PCBs.
11482517	The ability of the commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) preparation Bromkal 70-5 DE to alter thyroid hormone and vitamin A levels as well as microsomal enzyme activities was compared with that of the commercial polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) preparation Aroclor 1254 in orally exposed female rats (Sprague-Dawley) and mice (C57BL/6 N). Additional mice were exposed to the PBDE congener 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (DE-47), or to the PCB congener 2,3,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB-105). For 14 days the animals were given approximately isomolar daily oral doses of Aroclor 1254, CB-105 (both 10 mg/kg body weight), Bromkal 70-5 DE or DE-47 (both at 18 mg/kg body weight). In addition, further groups of rats and mice received a higher dose of Bromkal 70-5 DE, 36 mg/kg body weight. Bromkal 70-5 DE and DE-47 decreased plasma free and total thyroxine (T4) levels in both rats and mice, although with lower potency than that of Aroclor 1254 and CB-105. By contrast, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were not significantly changed in any of the groups. Reduction of hepatic vitamin A levels was seen in rats after Aroclor 1254 and Bromkal 70-5 DE exposure. A similar tendency was seen also in mice, but the effects were significant only for concentration data and not the total amount. Induction ofmicrosomal phase I enzymes, measured as ethoxy, methoxy and pentoxy resorufin O-dealkylase (EROD, MROD, PROD) activities, was greatest after exposure to Aroclor 1254/CB-105 but were also significant in the Bromkal 70-5 DE/DE-47-treated groups. However, induction of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) was small and for most groups insignificant. In conclusion, the PBDE compounds studied, although having a lower potency than the PCB compounds, decreased thyroxine and vitamin A levels and induced microsomal enzyme activities. Rats were more sensitive to the observed effects than mice. Microsomal phase I activity might be related, directly or indirectly, to the T4 and vitamin A effects, whereas several factors (such as weak enzyme induction and lack of correlation with altered T4 and vitamin A levels) argue against any UDPGT-related effects.
11940460	Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (HO-PCBs) and octachlorostyrene (4-HO-HpCS), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were determined in umbilical cord plasma samples from three different regions of Québec. The regions studied included two coastal areas where exposure to PCBs is high because of marine-food-based diets--Nunavik (Inuit people) and the Lower North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (subsistence fishermen)--and a southern Québec urban center where PCB exposure is at background levels (Québec City). The main chlorinated phenolic compound in all regions was PCP. Concentrations of PCP were not significantly different among regions (geometric mean concentration 1,670 pg/g, range 628-7,680 pg/g wet weight in plasma). The ratio of PCP to polychlorinated biphenyl congener number 153 (CB153) concentration ranged from 0.72 to 42.3. Sum HO-PCB (sigma HO-PCBs) concentrations were different among regions, with geometric mean concentrations of 553 (range 238-1,750), 286 (103-788), and 234 (147-464) pg/g wet weight plasma for the Lower North Shore, Nunavik, and the southern Québec groups, respectively. Lower North Shore samples also had the highest geometric mean concentration of sum PCBs (sum of 49 congeners; sigma PCBs), 2,710 (525-7,720) pg/g wet weight plasma. sigma PCB concentrations for Nunavik samples and southern samples were 1,510 (309-6,230) and 843 (290-1,650) pg/g wet weight plasma. Concentrations (log transformed) of sigma HO-PCBs and sigma PCBs were significantly correlated (r = 0.62, p < 0.001), as were concentrations of all major individual HO-PCB congeners and individual PCB congeners. In Nunavik and Lower North Shore samples, free thyroxine (T4) concentrations (log transformed) were negatively correlated with the sum of quantitated chlorinated phenolic compounds (sum PCP and sigma HO-PCBs; r = -0.47, p = 0.01, n = 20) and were not correlated with any PCB congeners or sigma PCBs. This suggests that PCP and HO-PCBs are possibly altering thyroid hormone status in newborns, which could lead to neurodevelopmental effects in infants. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of chlorinated phenolic compounds on thyroid hormone status in newborns.
11154948	Female minks (Mustela vison) fed diets based on freshwater, marine or mixed fish were exposed to 1 mg of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a day for 21 weeks. The plasma leptin and thyroxine concentrations and the glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phophorylase activities in the liver were measured at the end of the experiment. The plasma thyroxine concentrations were significantly higher in the group exposed to PCBs. The mean plasma leptin concentration and glucose-6-phosphatase activity was the highest in the group that had the lowest body-mass index (BMI). The glycogen phophorylase activity was the highest in the freshwater fish-control group. The results suggest that the amount of fat in the body of the female minks is not the only determinant of the plasma leptin levels, but the leptin levels seem to rise with a lowered BMI unlike in rodents or humans. The positive correlation between the leptin levels and the glucose-6-phosphatase activity suggests increased gluconeogenesis with high leptin levels. Subchronic exposure to PCBs seems to have no effect on the plasma leptin levels or the glucose-6-phophatase activities, but it elevates significantly the plasma thyroxine levels with a mechanism that remains unknown.
1432297	Following the explosion of a transformer, passersby, building occupants, and cleanup personnel had potential exposure to the transformer dielectric fluid containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). As part of a medical evaluation, blood serum was analyzed for PCBs, and the concentrations found were similar to that of a regional comparison group (median 4.0 ng/mL or parts per billion, range 1-10, n = 60). Some workers employed by the utility company that owned the transformer had potential exposure to PCBs in the past. This positive comparison group had significantly higher serum PCB concentrations, related to known direct contact (median 5.0, mean 14 ng/mL, 1-187, n = 25) or not (median 4.0, mean 11 ng/mL, 2-72, n = 17). Therefore, in this investigation, elevation of serum PCB levels could be related to past contact during work with transformers, but not to potential short-term exposure at the time of a transfer explosion.
23899181	Polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs are ubiquitous and persistent environmental compounds. Exposure of workers handling these materials can be assessed by biological monitoring. We have compared the concentration of PCBs in the plasma of exposed workers as measured by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (mean = 40.9 ng ml(-1), range = 6.7-120.3 ng ml(-1)) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (mean = 47.1 ng ml(-1), range = 6.8-186.2 ng ml(-1)). There was a good overall correlation between the two methods (n = 28, r = 0.92). We conclude that an ELISA is a useful screening tool for biological monitoring purposes where there is not immediate access to standard analytical equipment or where a very high throughput of samples is required. 
23054994	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between serum concentrations of hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) and PCBs and measures of thyroid hormone status of Japanese pregnant women. METHODS: The concentrations of free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) as well as 16 OH-PCB isomers and 29 PCB isomers were analyzed in the serum of 129 women sampled in the first trimester of gestation. Dietary and lifestyle information of the subjects was obtained by self-administered questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was performed using measures of thyroid hormones as the dependent variable and serum levels of OH-PCBs/PCBs, urinary iodine concentration, and other potential covariates (age, BMI, smoking, etc.) as independent variables. RESULTS: Geometric mean (GM) concentration of the sum of 16 isomers of OH-PCBs was 120 pg/g wet wt. and that of 29 isomers of PCBs was 68 ng/g lipid wt., respectively, in the serum of the subjects. Iodine nutrition was considered adequate to high from urinary iodine level (GM, 370 μg/g creatinine). The mean concentration of TSH, fT4 and TBG was 1.34 ± 1.37 μIU/mL, 1.22 ± 0.16 ng/dL and 33.0 ± 6.4 μg/mL, respectively, with a small number of subjects who were outside the reference range. Multiple regression analysis revealed that serum concentrations of OH-PCBs/PCBs were not significantly associated with any of the measures of thyroid hormone status. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure/body burden of OH-PCBs and PCBs at environmental levels does not have a measurable effect on thyroid hormones. 
16203234	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are thought to cause numerous adverse health effects, but their impact on estrogen signaling is still not fully understood. In the present study, we used the ER-CALUX bioassay to determine estrogenic/antiestrogenic activities of the prevalent PCB congeners and PCB mixtures isolated from human male serum. The samples were collected from residents of an area with an extensive environmental contamination from a former PCB production site as well as from a neighboring background region in eastern Slovakia. We found that the lower-chlorinated PCBs were estrogenic, whereas the prevalent higher-chlorinated PCB congeners 138, 153, 170, 180, 187, 194, 199, and 203, as well as major PCB metabolites, behaved as antiestrogens. Coplanar PCBs had no direct effect on estrogen receptor (ER) activation in this in vitro model. In human male serum samples, high levels of PCBs were associated with a decreased ER-mediated activity and an increased dioxin-like activity, as determined by the DR-CALUX assay. 17beta-Estradiol (E2) was responsible for a major part of estrogenic activity identified in total serum extracts. Significant negative correlations were found between dioxin-like activity, as well as mRNA levels of cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1B1 in lymphocytes, and total estrogenic activity. For sample fractions containing only persistent organic pollutants (POPs), the increased frequency of antiestrogenic samples was associated with a higher sum of PCBs. This suggests that the prevalent non-dioxin-like PCBs were responsible for the weak antiestrogenic activity of some POPs fractions. Our data also suggest that it might be important to pay attention to direct effects of PCBs on steroid hormone levels in heavily exposed subjects.
827981	Blood samples were taken for two successive years from canvasback ducks trapped in the Chesapeake Bay. The first winter (1972-1973) five plasma enzymes known to respond to organochlorine poisoning were examined. Abnormal enzyme elevations suggested that 20% of the population sampled (23/115 ducks) might contain organochlorine contaminants, but no residue analyses were performed. The second winter (1974) two of the same enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, and a third enzyme known to be specifically inhibited by lead, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, were assayed in 95 blood samples. Blood residues of organochlorine compounds and of lead were determined in representative samples, and the correlations between residue levels and enzyme changes were examined. The enzyme bioassays in 1974 indicated that lead was a more prevalent environmental contaminant than organochlorine compounds in canvasback ducks; 17% of the blood samples had less than one-half of the normal delta-aminole vulinic acid dehydratase activity, but only 11% exhibited abnormal aspartate aminotransferase or lactate dehydrogenase activities. These findings were confirmed by residue analyses that demonstrated lead concentrations four times higher than background levels, but only relatively low organochlorine concentrations. There was a highly significant inverse correlation between delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity and blood lead concentrations (P less than 0.01), and a weaker but significant correlation between plasma aspartate aminotransferase activity and blood PCB concentrations (P less than 0.05). It was apparent that delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity in the blood provided a sensitive and precise estimate of lead contamination in waterfowl. In canvasback ducks 200 ppb of lead in the blood caused a 75% decrease in delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity, a magnitude of enzyme inhibition that disturbs heme synthesis and is regarded as detrimental in humans.
22004731	We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and non-dioxin-like PCBs in paired samples of blood and breast milk collected from 67 secundiparas in Sapporo City, Japan, and combined this data with those of the 30 secundiparas previously measured. The arithmetic mean total toxic equivalents (TEQ-WHO) concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of the 97 secundiparous subjects were 3.0-23 (mean: 13, median: 14) and 2.7-20 (mean: 8.6, median: 8.5) pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively. The sums of the concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners that were measured in the subjects' blood and breast milk were 16-326 (mean: 107, median: 100) and 12-252 (mean: 73, median: 67) ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. The partitioning ratios of individual congeners of PCDDs, PCDFs, dioxin-like PCBs, and non-dioxin-like PCBs from blood to breast milk in secundiparas were almost the same as those of primiparas that have been recently reported, suggesting that the partitioning ratios of these compounds from maternal blood to breast milk in women is little affected by delivery. Furthermore, the partition of PCB congeners with chlorine at the 2-, 3-, 4'-, and 5-positions or the 2-, 4-, 4'-, and 5-positions of the biphenyl ring from the blood to the breast milk tended to occur at a higher level than that of other congeners. In particular, the levels of tetraCB-74 and hexaCB-146 in the breast milk for both primiparous and secundiparous mothers were slightly higher than those in the blood.
17589595	BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can influence the immune system, possibly increasing the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, as metabolic change due to obesity has been proposed as one mechanism of osteoarthritis (OA), POPs stored in adipose tissue may be also associated with OA. OBJECTIVE: Our goal in this study was to examine associations of background exposure to POPs with arthritis among the general population. DESIGN: We investigated cross-sectional associations of serum POPs concentrations with the prevalence of self-reported arthritis in 1,721 adults >/= 20 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. RESULTS: Among several POPs, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or nondioxin-like PCBs were positively associated with arthritis in women. After adjusting for possible confounders, odds ratios (ORs) were 1.0, 2.1, 3.5, and 2.9 across quartiles of dioxin-like PCBs (p for trend = 0.02). Corresponding figures for nondioxin-like PCBs were 1.0, 1.6, 2.6, and 2.5 (p for trend = 0.02). Organochlorine (OC) pesticides were also weakly associated with arthritis in women. For subtypes of arthritis, respectively, RA was more strongly associated with PCBs than was OA. The adjusted ORs for RA were 1.0, 7.6, 6.1, and 8.5 for dioxin-like PCBs (p for trend = 0.05), 1.0, 2.2, 4.4, and 5.4 for nondioxin-like PCBs (p for trend < 0.01), and 1.0, 2.8, 2.7, and 3.5 for OC pesticides (p for trend = 0.15). POPs in men did not show any clear relation with arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility that background exposure to PCBs may be involved in pathogenesis of arthritis, especially RA, in women should be investigated in prospective studies. 
15542352	The ability of zinc to retard oxidative processes has been recognized for many years. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent and bioaccumulative environmental toxicants. Previous study has indicated that PCBs can have deleterious effects, including oxidative stress, on various aspects of reproduction in male rats. The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant role of zinc in PCB-exposed ventral prostate of albino rats. A group of 20 rats were treated with Aroclor 1254 (2 mg/kg body weight/day, i.p.) for 30 days. After the PCB treatment, 10 rats were treated as PCB control. The remaining 10 rats were given zinc (Zn SO(4)) (200 mg/kg body weight/day, p.o.) for 10 days. Ventral prostatic enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were estimated in all the groups. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and ventral prostatic acid phosphatase (ACP) were also estimated. Serum hormonal profiles such as total tri-iodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxine (T(4)), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), testosterone, and estradiol were estimated. Ventral prostatic androgen and estrogen receptors, ventral prostatic zinc content, and serum zinc concentration were also quantified in all the groups. Antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and ACP were decreased while an increase in H(2)O(2) and LPO were observed in PCB-treated animals. Decreased serum total T(3), T(4), testosterone, estradiol and increased TSH were observed in PCB-exposed rats. Ventral prostatic androgen and estrogen receptors were also decreased significantly in PCB-exposed rats. Zinc administration restored to previous levels all parameters except ventral prostatic ACP. These results suggest that PCB induces oxidative stress in rat ventral prostate by decreasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes; the effects could be reversed by the administration of zinc. The adverse effect of PCBs (Aroclor 1254) and zinc on ventral prostate might be due to indirect action through hormonal regulation.
21851983	Primitive electronic-waste recycling resulted in serious pollution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the environment of Guiyu, China. We aimed to assess body burdens of PCBs and potential health risks for neonates. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples were collected from Guiyu, and the control area of Chaonan, China. PCBs in UCB were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The median ∑PCBs concentration was 338.56 ng g⁻¹ lipid in UCB samples from Guiyu, vs. 140.16 ng g⁻¹ lipid in samples from Chaonan. Mothers' involvement in electronic-waste recycling activities and house used as family workshop were the significant factors that contributed to ∑PCBs level. Some individual PCB congeners were found to correlate with reduced neonatal height, weight, Apgar scores, gestational age, and body mass index (BMI). Difference of ∑PCBs level was found between normal birth and adverse birth outcomes. Neonates from Guiyu are exposed to high levels of PCBs; prenatal exposure to PCBs appears to influence neonatal health, but still needs further confirmation.
20691717	A metabonomic approach using (1)H NMR spectroscopy was adopted to investigate the metabonomic pattern of rat urine after oral administration of environmental endocrine disruptors (EDs) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) alone or in combination and to explore the possible hepatotoxic mechanisms of combined exposure to PCBs and TCDD. (1)H NMR spectra of urines collected 24h before and after exposure were analyzed via pattern recognition by using principal component analysis (PCA). Serum biochemistry and liver histopathology indicated significant hepatotoxicity in the rats of the combined group. The PCA scores plots of urinary (1)H NMR data showed that all the treatment groups could be easily distinguished from the control group, so could the PCBs or TCDD group and the combined group. The loadings plots of the PCA revealed remarkable increases in the levels of lactate, glucose, taurine, creatine, and 2-hydroxy-isovaleric acid and reductions in the levels of 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, succinate, hippurate, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in rat urine after exposure. These changes were more striking in the combined group. The changed metabolites may be considered possible biomarker for the hepatotoxicity. The present study demonstrates that combined exposure to PCBs and TCDD induced significant hepatotoxicity in rats, and mitochondrial dysfunction and fatty acid metabolism perturbations might contribute to the hepatotoxicity. There was good conformity between changes in the urine metabonomic pattern and those in serum biochemistry and liver histopathology. These results showed that the NMR-based metabonomic approach may provide a promising technique for the evaluation of the combined toxicity of EDs.
12530594	Following an electrical transformer fire in Staten Island, New York, a health surveillance program was established for 60 New York City firefighters and emergency medical technicians exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Exposure potential was documented after high levels of PCBs and PCDFs were found on transformer and firefighters' uniforms. Personnel received comprehensive medical examinations, and the results were compared with preexposure values. Serum was analyzed for PCBs, PCDFs, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs). Follow-up was conducted 9 mo later. Thirty-two of 58 (55%) firefighters reported initial symptoms, and 3 firefighters required brief medical leave. Pulmonary functions, exercise performance, serum liver functions, and serum lipid profiles were normal or unchanged from preexposure baselines. Serum PCBs averaged 2.92 +/- 1.96 ppb (range = 1.9-11.0 ppb). Five (8%) had serum PCBs that were greater than or equal to 6 ppb. Eight (73%) had a significant decrease (p = .05) in serum PCB level at the time of follow-up. Serum toxic equivalency (TEQ [1998 World Health Organization]) for total PCDDs and PCDFs averaged 39.0 +/- 21.5 (n = 48). Eighteen (38%) had elevated TEQs (i.e., > 40). All firefighters had no short-term heath effects. Modern firefighting uniforms are not meant to replace HAZMAT suits, but these uniforms provide protection from this chemical exposure for most firefighters.
20426459	In this study, we determined the residue levels and patterns of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) in the blood from eight species of toothed whales and three species of baleen whales stranded along the Japanese coast during 1999-2007. Penta- through hepta-chlorinated PCB congeners were the dominant homologue groups in all cetaceans. In contrast, specific differences in the distribution of dominant OH-PCB isomers and homologues were found among the cetacean species. In five species of toothed whales (melon-headed whale, Stejneger's beaked whale, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Blainville's beaked whale, and killer whale), the predominant homologues were OH-penta-PCBs followed by OH-tetra-PCBs and OH-tri-PCBs. The predominant homologues of finless porpoise and beluga whale were OH-penta-PCBs followed by OH-hexa-PCBs and OH-tri-PCBs. The predominant OH-PCB isomers were para-OH-PCBs such as 4OH-CB26, 4'OH-CB25/4'OH-CB26/4OH-CB31, 4OH-CB70, 4'OH-CB72, 4'OH-CB97, 4'OH-CB101/4'OH-CB120, and 4OH-CB107/4'OH-CB108 in toothed whales. In three baleen whales (common minke whale, Bryde's whale, and humpback whale) and in sperm whale (which is a toothed whale), OH-octa-PCB (4OH-CB202) was the predominant homologue group accounting for 40-80% of the total OH-PCB concentrations. The differences in concentrations and profiles of OH-PCBs may suggest species-specific diets, metabolic capability, and the transthyretin (TTR) binding specificity. These results reveal that the accumulation profiles of OH-PCBs in cetacean blood are entirely different from the profiles found in pinnipeds, polar bear, and humans.
10448565	We report a direct immersion SPME-GC/mu ECD method for the determination of non-volatile pollutants (Aroclor 1254) in human blood plasma using an enzymatic proteolytic approach to overcome the protein fouling problem. A nonspecific serine protease, Proteinase K, is used to remove the fouling interference. Significant improvement in relative repeatability from 28.9% to 3.4% (n = 10) was obtained. Analyte recovery up to 93% and detection limit of 1.0 ppb (total PCB) were achieved.
6411677	Forty-four laboratories participated in evaluation of a method for determining polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as AR 1254 in serum at the parts per billion level. The method involves deproteinating serum with methanol, extracting with hexane-ethyl ether, and eluting PCBs from deactivated silica gel for gas-liquid chromatographic determination with electron capture detection. Compounds are quantitated by using the Webb-McCall factors. Five serum pools, 4 containing in vivo-fortified PCBs (as AR 1254) or 8 in vitro-fortified chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHs), or both, were used. For PCB fortification levels of 9.89 (EP 2), 24.74 (EP 3), and 74.20 ppb (EP 4), interlaboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) for collaborators that adhered to protocol were 92.7, 67.6, and 25.8%, respectively. CVs on the same pools analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were 7.4, 7.8, and 4.6%, respectively. Average interlaboratory recoveries for pools EP 2, EP 3, and EP 4 were 138.1, 111.2, and 91.1%, respectively, and 99.8, 89.6, and 90.4%, respectively, for CDC on the same pools. There was a general decrease in the mean error for those laboratories that had participated in an earlier study in which they were allowed to use their own methods.
23618890	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between tibial bone lead and serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations and neurocognitive function. METHODS: The study population consisted of men and women former capacitor workers had been employed by the General Electric Corporation between 1946 and 1977. Regression analyses evaluated the association between neurocognitive function and lipid-adjusted serum PCB and tibia lead concentrations. RESULTS: Tibia lead, but not serum PCBs, was significantly correlated with deficits in neurocognitive function. Women showed more associations between tibia lead and neurocognitive function than men, especially regarding executive function. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that low levels of tibia lead, but not serum PCBs, are associated with neurocognitive deficits and that postmenopausal women show a greater number of deficits in executive function than men. 
21665017	The use of most polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) has been restricted in China; however, their use remains a concern because of their adverse effects on human health, especially on fetuses and infants. To date, there is no data regarding the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai. In order to evaluate PCB and OCP exposure levels and the contribution of dietary habits to these levels, we determined the concentrations of 8 PCBs and 14 OCPs in the umbilical cord blood serum of healthy pregnant women in Shanghai. Dietary habits of the pregnant women were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. Results showed that p, p'-DDE, HCB and β-HCH were the major pollutants present in the serum samples; PCBs were detected in a few samples at low concentrations. Age, weight and body mass index before delivery were positively associated with serum levels of p, p'-DDE and β-HCH. Women and their husbands who had higher education levels, higher income levels, tended to have higher levels of p, p'-DDE and β-HCH. Spearman correlation analysis results suggested that consumption of foods such as milk, eggs, meat, fish, and shrimp may contribute to higher serum levels of p, p'-DDE and β-HCH. Furthermore, multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of fried/flamed food and shellfish were positively associated with β-HCH levels, and that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of parity, beef, pork, mutton, and shrimp were positively associated with p, p'-DDE levels. This is the first study to investigate the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai, and it should provide useful information for future related research.
19403125	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent compounds that may pose an environmental hazard to humans, food being the main source of exposure for the general population. OBJECTIVE: To measure the serum concentrations of the main PCBs in subjects from the general population in Spain, and to assess potential determinants of such concentrations. METHODS: Serum was obtained from blood samples of 953 subjects aged 35-64 years, residents in five Spanish regions (three from the North and two from the South), randomly selected from the EPIC-Spain cohort. Blood collection took place during 1992-1996 and four PCB congeners (118, 138, 153 and 180) were determined by means of gas chromatography with electron-capture detection (GC-ECD). RESULTS: The concentration of total PCBs was 459 ng/g lipids (or 3.1 microg/l); the corresponding figures for PCB 153 were 186 ng/g lipids and 1.25 microg/l. Men had higher values than women, PCB levels increased with age, and serum concentration of PCBs was higher in northern regions. Body mass index (BMI) was inversely related to PCB concentrations, and fish intake was the dietary factor showing the greatest association with serum PCBs. The pattern described was similar for each congener separately. CONCLUSIONS: We found concentrations similar to those reported in European countries where blood collection was carried during the same period. Regional differences within Spain are not fully explained by anthropometric or dietary factors. The inverse association with BMI suggests that in the mid-1990s there was still ongoing or recent exposure to PCBs in Spain. 
9525537	The authors examined the hypothesized association between the body burden of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in women and the risk of low birth weight for their infants. In Sweden, a main exposure route for PCBs and other persistent organochlorine compounds is through the consumption of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea (on the Swedish east coast). A previous comparison between a cohort of consumers of large quantities of fish from the Swedish east coast and a reference population, together with a following analysis based on questionnaire data from a case-control study within the east coast cohort, supported the hypothesized association. In 1995, blood samples were collected from the wives and ex-wives of fishermen from the Swedish east coast (n = 192) who had given birth during the period 1973-1991. Cases (n = 57), i.e., infants with low birth weight (1,500-2,750 g), were matched with controls (n = 135; birth weight, 3,250-4,500 g) on gender, parity, and calendar year of birth. The concentration of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) in plasma was analyzed; it has been suggested that CB-153 is a relevant biomarker of exposure to PCBs. The concentration of CB-153 in the plasma of mothers during the year of childbirth was "estimated" using some alternative plausible kinetic models. For two alternative estimated exposure datasets, which were focused on separately, an increase in the risk of a low birth weight was observed at a CB-153 concentration of 300 and 400 ng/g lipid weight, respectively (adjusted odds ratios of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-4.7) and 2.3 (95% CI 0.9-5.9)). The present results strengthen the findings reported previously for this study population.
21344607	The effects of in utero and lactational exposure to two structurally different polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners on follicular dynamics and the pituitary-gonadal axis in female lambs were investigated. Pregnant ewes received corn oil, PCB 118, or PCB 153, and offspring was maintained until 60 days postpartum. Ovarian follicles were quantified using stereology. Plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured using radioimmunoassay before and after administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog. PCB 118 exposure increased numbers of transitional, secondary, and the sum of secondary, early antral, and antral (Σsecondary-antral) follicles, PCB 153 exposure only increased the number of primary follicles. GnRH-induced LH levels were significantly elevated in the PCB 153 exposure group. We conclude that PCB 153 and PCB 118 alter follicular dynamics in lambs and modulate the responsiveness of the pituitary gland to GnRH.
12676596	Humans are always exposed to mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), so assessment of their health effects is complicated. Because the original sources are relatively standard mixtures that change in predictable ways while traversing the environment, there is substantial uniformity in the congener mixtures people carry. To the extent that concentrations are highly correlated, measuring multiple congeners within correlated groups would be unnecessary and estimation of separate biologic effects would be impossible. We examined correlation patterns in previously collected data on 38 congeners (and 14 other organochlorines) from 497 human milk samples from Canada from 1992. Congeners 138, 153, 156, 157, 170, 183, 187, 194, 199, and 203 were highly intercorrelated; 180 had slightly lower correlations with this group. Congeners 74, 105, and 118 were highly intercorrelated and moderately to highly correlated with the first group. Congener 99 had moderate correlations with both these groups, and congener 66 had lesser correlations with the primary group. In contrast, congeners 28, 44, 49, 60, 90/101, 128, 137, and 193 showed little correlation with any other congeners. The remaining 14 congeners were uninformative; they were quantified in fewer than 30% of samples, and varying lipid concentrations meant that those quantified were not necessarily at higher concentrations than those not quantified. In study of human health effects of PCBs, the congener pattern present in the population under study should be examined when deciding which congeners to measure; instead of solely redundant or uninformative congeners, attention should be given to other congeners that may be more useful in addressing the question of interest.
20089337	Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human have been studied extensively; however, polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) have been studied less widely. The mean concentrations of PCNs, PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs in 61 healthy human volunteers were 2170 pg/g lipid, 452 pg/g lipid, 116 pg/g lipid, and 120 ng/g lipid respectively, and the mean toxic equivalents (TEQs) contributed by PCNs, PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs were 5.88, 5.22, 5.48, and 5.33 pg/g lipid, respectively. PCNs contributed to 26.8% of the total TEQs. 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB126, and hepta-CN-73 accounted for >62% of the total TEQs in the human serum samples. The overall serum PCN homologue profiles of all subjects were dominated by tetra- and penta-CN homologues, and the most predominant individual congener was hepta-CN-73, which contributed 17.5% of the total serum PCN concentration. Enrichment of hepta-CN-73 in the human serum samples might be due to contributors from combustion sources.
8703183	BACKGROUND: In utero exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, has been linked to adverse effects on neurologic and intellectual function in infants and young children. We assessed whether these effects persist through school age and examined their importance in the acquisition of reading and arithmetic skills. METHODS: We tested 212 children, recruited as newborns to overrepresent infants born to women who had eaten Lake Michigan fish contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls. A battery of IQ and achievement tests was administered when the children were 11 years of age. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls in maternal serum and milk at delivery were slightly higher than in the general population. A composite measure of prenatal exposure was derived from concentrations in umbilical-cord serum and maternal serum and milk. RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls was associated with lower full-scale and verbal IQ scores after control for potential confounding variables such as socioeconomic status (P = 0.02). The strongest effects related to memory and attention. The most highly exposed children were three times as likely to have low average IQ scores (P <0.001) and twice as likely to be at least two years behind in reading comprehension (P = 0.03). Although larger quantities of polychlorinated biphenyls are transferred by breast-feeding than in utero, there were deficits only in associated with transplacental exposure, suggesting that the developing fetal brain is particularly sensitive to these compounds. CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls in concentrations slightly higher than those in the general population can have a long-term impact on intellectual function. 
18222549	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) bioaccumulate in blubber of marine mammals. Therefore, it is important to understand the structure and dynamics of blubber layers and how they affect the accumulation of POPs and subsequent biochemical responses. We used established histological and immunohistochemical methods to document the structure of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) blubber and to assess the expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) in skin-blubber biopsies of dolphins sampled in the waters off Charleston, SC (CHS) (N=38), and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) (N=36). CYP1A1 expression was strongest and most frequent in capillary endothelial cells and was stratified in blubber; the greatest CYP1A1 staining was in the deepest layer. CYP1A1 expression in deep blubber and 2,3,7,8-TCDD Toxic Equivalents measured in the entire blubber were significantly higher in dolphins from CHS as compared to those from IRL. Adipocyte size was associated with the extent of CYP1A1 expression. Male dolphins with smaller adipocytes from CHS and IRL had higher levels of CYP1A1 expression in deep blubber. In CHS females, CYP1A1 expression in vascular endothelial cells varied with reproductive status. CYP1A1 expression in the deep layer was highest in simultaneously pregnant-lactating dolphins, and these dolphins had the smallest adipocytes in deep blubber. In all dolphins, CYP1A1 expression in the deep blubber layer was positively related to concentrations of hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) in plasma. In summary, redistribution of AHR agonists from blubber into the circulatory system may enhance PCB metabolism and production of OH-PCBs by induction of CYP1A1 in hepatocytes and, possibly, by induction of CYP1A1 in endothelial cells of the deep blubber. The OH-PCBs thus formed have the potential to interfere with thyroid hormone homeostasis.
14966849	A rapid screening method, previously developed and validated for the determination of 60 PCB congeners in human serum by using high-resolution gas chromatography coupled with low-resolution mass spectrometry, was applied to the establishment of the reference values in the general population. The reliability of this method was further confirmed by analyzing ten serum samples, obtained from the same population group involved in the original study, by electron impact ionization with either low- or high-resolution mass spectrometry. Analyses in electron capture negative ionization mode were also performed for the determination of 'dioxin-like' isomers. The data were found to be in good accordance with one another, especially for the congeners of highest environmental significance. Then, 162 real serum samples were analyzed for the presence of PCBs. Comparison with the results from other studies reported in the literature showed that a similar profile was observed; the most abundant congeners were #153, #180, #138 and #170. A statistical analysis was performed to determine whether there were significant correlations between PCB concentrations and specific variables such as age, gender, and dietary habits.
8187704	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chemicals, manufactured in volume from about 1929 to the 1970s. Environmental contamination by PCBs has been documented in various substances, including human tissue. PCBs have been measured in human tissue by a variety of analytical methods. PCB levels have been reported as an approximation of total PCB content expressed in terms of a commercial mixture, by identification and quantification of chromatographic peaks, or by qualitative and quantitative characterization of specific congeners. Until recently, the coplanar mono-ortho- and di-ortho substituted PCBs, which are especially toxic and present in significant concentration in humans from industrial countries, had not been measured in human tissues. Examples of various types of commonly used analyses are presented in general population subjects and in persons who experienced special exposure. In this paper, the usefulness of PCB blood determinations following potential exposure is demonstrated, and their application in health studies is illustrated from a number of case studies. Coplanar PCB, mono-ortho-substituted and di-ortho-substituted PCB levels in human blood are presented and compared with polychlorinated dioxin (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) levels in the U.S. population. Dioxin toxic equivalents for the two groups of chemicals are calculated and compared. It is found that mono-ortho-substituted and, to a lesser extent, coplanar PCBs, contribute substantially to dioxin toxic equivalents (TEq) in blood from U.S. adults. Because of substantial PCB contribution to dioxin toxic equivalents, total dioxinlike toxicity can only be determined if dioxins, dibenzofurans, and dioxinlike PCBs are measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7953468	Children secondarily exposed through their mothers to a toxic rice oil containing PCDFs and PCBs in the Yu-cheng incident have shown developmental delay even a decade after the incident. Forty-five serum samples were collected from these children in February 1991 ad small amounts analyzed for their contaminant content using sample enrichment and isotope dilution mass spectrometry. In about one-half the samples, detectable levels of PCDFs and PCBs could still be determined with average values for 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-PnCDF and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-HxCDF of 300 and 620 ng/kg serum lipid, respectively. The mean of the total PCBs on a whole weight basis was 7.5 micrograms/kg. These concentrations of PCDFs and PCBs are still 10 to 25 times higher than those from a matched control population. Although the serum levels did not correlate with developmental delays, those for the two PCDFs but not the total PCBs correlated with duration of breast feeding indicative of postnatal exposure. The results of this study suggest that estimation of past prenatal exposure of children to PCDFs is best carried out using current mother and not current child blood concentrations.
15379968	An increasing incidence of testicular cancer has been reported from several western countries during the last decades. According to current hypothesis testicular cancer is initiated during the foetal period and exposure to endocrine disruptors such as some persistent organic pollutants has been of concern. We have previously reported the results for concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (pp'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlordanes in 58 cases with testicular cancer, 61 age-matched controls and 44 case mothers and 45 control mothers. In that report, significant increase of odds ratio (OR) was found for sum of PCBs, HCB, trans- and cis-nonachlordane in case mothers. These data have now been further analysed for 37 congeners of PCBs. No significant differences were found among cases and controls. However, case mothers had significantly increased concentrations of a number of PCB congeners. A priori decided grouping of PCBs yielded for oestrogenic PCBs OR = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95-6.0, enzyme-inducing PCBsOR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.03-6.5 and toxic equivalents (TEQ) yielded OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.3-8.4. These data further elucidate the role of foetal exposure to different PCB congeners in the aetiology of testicular cancer.
12441362	This study was done to generate kinetic data on individual congeners of chlorinated biphenyls in the low dose range, which could be of value in the risk assessment procedure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single oral dose of a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (CBs) containing either CBs 105, 118, 138, 153, 156, 157, 170, and 180 (A-mix) or CBs 28, 52, 77, 87, and 101 (B-mix). Liver, serum, and adipose tissue were collected after 6 h up to 135 days, from rats given the A-mix, and after 6 h up to 4 days from rats given the B-mix. CB concentrations were measured in liver, serum, and adipose tissue. In addition, this study provides kinetic data of one of the major CB metabolites, 4-hydroxy-2,3,3',4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (4-OH-CB107). The low doses used resulted in serum CB concentrations similar to human background serum concentrations. In the A-mix experiment all CBs show high initial liver and serum concentrations followed by redistribution into adipose tissue. Differences between congeners were correlated to molecular weight. High molecular weight correlated to lower uptake and slower redistribution. During dynamic steady-state the tissue concentrations decreased with a calculated first order rate between 54-129 days for halving the concentrations (half-life). Most of the decrease in concentration was explained by the growth-related increase of tissue masses in general and adipose tissue in particular. In the B-mix experiment, the concentrations of CBs in adipose tissue decreased with between 25 and 59% from day 1 to day 4. These results show that the B-mix congeners, given at low dose, have longer half-lives than previously reported in high dose studies. Partition coefficients between body compartments are reported and for the first time a high and congener specific liver-to-serum ratio of CB 77 is observed.
16263525	The aim of this study is to examine the association between transplacental exposure to dioxins/polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and thyroid and growth hormones in newborns. We recruited 118 pregnant women, between 25 and 34 years of age, at the obstetric clinic. Personal data collected included reproductive and medical histories and physical factors. Clinicians gathered placental and umbilical cord serum upon delivery and carefully scored the 118 newborns, making both structural and functional assessments. We analyzed placentas for 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and 12 dioxin-like PCB congeners with the World Health Organization-defined toxic equivalent factors, and six indicator PCBs by high-resolution gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. We analyzed thyroid and growth hormones from cord serum using radioimmunoassay. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding globulin-3, and thyroxine x thyroid-stimulating hormone (T4 x TSH) were significantly associated with increased placental weight and Quetelet index (in kilograms per square meter; correlation coefficient r = 0.2-0.3; p < 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed independently and significantly decreased free T4 (FT4) x TSH with increasing non-ortho PCBs (r = -0.2; p < 0.05). We suggest that significant FT4 feedback alterations to the hypothalamus result from in utero exposure to non-ortho PCBs. Considering the vast existence of bioaccumulated dioxins and PCBs and the resultant body burden in modern society, we suggest routine screening of both thyroid hormone levels and thyroid function in newborns.
8920591	A method for the determination of environmentally relevant PCB congeners and organochlorine pesticides in human blood/serum is described. The method is validated through recovery experiments with standards and reproducibility of quality control samples.
17490634	The associations between in utero exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs), and free thyroxin (fT4) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) status in the newborn were investigated as a pilot study of a large-scale epidemiologic study on in utero PCB or OH-PCB exposure and thyroid function of the newborns. Umbilical cord tissue was used as the media for the biological monitoring of PCBs/OH-PCBs exposure in utero. For the measurement of fT4 and TSH, a heel-prick blood sample spotted on filter paper, which is called Guthrie card, is collected from each neonate at day 4-6 postpartum for this study when the mass screening sampling was performed. We showed that the concentration of total OH-PCBs and one of the OH-PCB congeners (OH-PCB 187) was related significantly to higher fT4 level of newborns. On the other hand, the concentration of total PCBs and PCB congeners (PCB 118, 138, 153, and 180) showed no relationship with fT4 and TSH level of the newborns. The results obtained in this pilot study indicated the possibility that in utero OH-PCBs exposure affects thyroid hormone status of newborns.
9496912	ras gene activation in a naturally exposed feral fish population may prove to be a particularly sensitive genetic marker of malignancy. The aim of this study was to relate our current knowledge of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) bioactivation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-induced DNA damage to ras gene activation in liver tumors from dragonets exposed to these environmental carcinogens. We identified a member of the ras gene family in the marine fish dragonet (Callionymus lyra). The first two exons of this new sequence showed a very high degree of homology with the human ras genes (81-86%) at the nucleic acid level and perfect homology at the amino-acid level. In a pilot study, we collected dragonets from the Seine estuary, an area highly contaminated with PAHs and PCBs. An increase in DNA adducts and an accumulation of ortho- and non-ortho-substituted chlorobiphenyls (CB-77, CB-126, and CB-169) were observed in the livers, a finding that correlates well with the levels of PAHs and PCBs in the sediment. Although liver neoplasia was uncommon, a codon 11 mutation was found in two fish with liver cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible correlation between hepatic precancerous lesions and ras gene activation in dragonets.
1909340	During a recent survey to determine serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) among people living around New Bedford, MA, U.S.A., an unidentified contaminant precluded the quantification of some early eluting Webb and McCall peaks. Loss of data is estimated to have reduced reported serum levels by 12%. Efforts to identify the contaminant by gas chromatography with an electron-capture detector, a Hall electrolytic condutivity detector, and mass spectrometer were not successful. Researchers ascertained, however, that the contaminant is not a PCB, it does not contain halogens, but it may contain phthalates. Vacutainer tubes and closures for serum storage bottles are suspected sources of contamination.
1903103	Concentrations of 12 selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and isomers in human serum and adipose tissue after environmental and short- and long-term occupational exposures were determined. The individual congener concentrations in adipose tissue varied between less than 0.01 and 420 micrograms/kg (tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and heptachlorobiphenyls); the dominating isomers were 2,2',4,4',5,5'- and 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexaCB, which represented approximately 90% of all PCBs in adipose tissue. Those isomers were also the most abundant in serum specimens after environmental exposure, their contribution together with the 2,2',3,4,4',5',6-heptaCB was approximately 90%. After short-term as well as long-term occupational exposure, the most remarkable changes were observed in the concentrations of the tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyls. In long-term occupational exposure 2,4,4'-triCB (mean 3.15 micrograms/liter) and 2,4,4',5-tetraCB (mean, 9.4 micrograms/liter) showed the highest concentrations, whereas after short-term exposure 2,2',5-tri- (mean 2.04 micrograms/liter) and 2,3',4,4'-tetraCB (mean 1.5 micrograms/liter) were most abundant. In people with only environmental exposure, the concentrations in adipose tissue of some PCB isomers were interrelated. The concentrations of the isomers 2,4,4'5-tetraCB (IUPAC 74), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaCB (IUPAC 153), 2,2',3,4,4'5'-hexaCB (IUPAC 138), 2,3,3',4,4',5-hexaCB (IUPAC 156), 2,2',3,4,4',5',6-heptaCB (IUPAC 183), and 2,2',3,3',4,4',5-heptaCB (IUPAC 171) showed close correlation, the coefficients varied from 0.42 to 0.98. The correlation between the concentrations of individual PCB isomers in adipose tissue was highest for 2,4-substituted highly chlorinated isomers, i.e., isomers with longest half-times in the body.
9216878	In 1979, a mass poisoning of more than 2000 people occurred in central Taiwan due to consumption of rice-bran oil contaminated with PCBs and their heat-degraded byproducts. The incident was later referred to as Yucheng (oil disease). Serum samples from 56 women with the 1979 exposure were collected in February 1992 and analyzed for their contaminant content using sample enrichment and isotope dilution mass spectrometry. In most of the samples, levels of PCDFs and PCBs were detectable, and the median values of 2,3,4,7,8-PCDFs and 1,2,3,4,7,8-PCDFs were 1,030 and 2,220 ng/kg serum lipid, respectively. The median level of the total PCBs on a whole weight basis was 8,730 ng/kg. The PCB/PCDF concentrations in Yucheng women 14 years after the toxic exposure were still one to two orders of magnitude higher than controls. Concentrations of PCB levels in 1992 were positively correlated with the 1980-1981 measured PCB levels in these women and both PCBs and PCDFs were negatively correlated with the total duration when these women breast fed their children between 1979 and 1992. It is concluded that serum levels of congener-specific PCBs/PCDFs in exposed women are good indicators of previous exposure and may provide important information for more reliable estimation of dose-response relationship.
22615239	The potential of three capillary columns based on β-cyclodextrin (i.e., Chirasil-Dex, BGB-172, and BGB-176SE) has been studied for the simultaneous enantiomeric separation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and methylsulfonyl metabolites of PCBs (MeSO(2)-PCBs) employing a heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatographic system (heart-cut MDGC). Among the columns studied, the BGB-176SE capillary column provided the best results, allowing the simultaneous enantioselective resolution of six MeSO(2)-PCBs and six chiral PCBs; the Chirasil-Dex column did not resolve any of the studied MeSO(2)-PCBs; and a poor resolution was obtained for three MeSO(2)-PCBs when the BGB-172 column was employed. The developed method was successfully applied to two fish oil and one cow liver samples commercially available, which showed different enantioselective pattern. PCBs 91 and 176 presented a clear enrichment of the second eluted atropisomer in codfish oil, whereas in fish oil sample, slight enrichment of the first eluted atropisomer of CB45 and the second eluted atropisomer of CB136 were observed.
21700918	OBJECTIVE: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), lipophilic chemicals that accumulate mainly in adipose tissue, have recently been linked to type 2 diabetes. However, evidence from prospective studies is sparse. This study was performed to evaluate prospective associations of type 2 diabetes with selected POPs among the elderly. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nineteen POPs (14 polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB] congeners, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 1 brominated diphenyl ether, and 1 dioxin) were measured in plasma collected at baseline in 725 participants, aged 70 years, of the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS). RESULTS: After adjusting for known type 2 diabetes risk factors, including obesity, odds ratios (ORs) (95% CIs) for type 2 diabetes at age 75 years (n = 36) according to the quintiles of a summary measure of concentrations of PCBs (vs. the lowest quintile) were 4.5, 5.1, 8.8 (1.8-42.7), and 7.5 (1.4-38.8) (P(trend) <0.01). Among organochlorine pesticides, adjusted ORs across concentrations of trans-nonachlor showed that P(trend) = 0.03. Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) across quintiles of the sum of three organochlorine pesticides were 1.1, 1.6, 1.5, and 3.4 (1.0-11.7) (P(trend) = 0.03). Neither brominated diphenyl ether 47 nor dioxin was significantly associated with incident diabetes. The sum of PCBs improved reclassification significantly when added to traditional risk factors for diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of incident cases, this study found that environmental exposure to some POPs substantially increased risk of future type 2 diabetes in an elderly population. 
21797774	Smoking appears to enhance the body's clearance of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) by inducing CYP1A2 activity based on studies with a limited number of participants. This hypothesis was evaluated by using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Specifically, adult participants were identified and the sums of their serum lipid-adjusted concentrations of 12 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) congeners, 33 PCB (total), 26 non-dioxin-like PCB, and 6 mono-ortho (dioxin-like) PCB were determined. In addition to evaluating the association of smoking, the association of caffeine consumption and the interaction between them was evaluated. Data analysis included regression models that were fitted with age, gender, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). R(2) varied from 34.8 to 66%. Smokers had significantly lower concentrations of total PCDD/PCDF than nonsmokers. New to this study, a siginificant interaction between caffeine consumption and smoking for total PCB was found. When caffeine was consumed less than once a day, smokers had higher concentrations of total PCB than nonsmokers. However, when caffeine was consumed at least once a day, smokers had lower concentrations than nonsmokers. A significant interaction between age and caffeine consumption frequency for each of the PCB groups was also observed. The differences in concentration between younger and older age groups were greater when caffeine was consumed at least once a day than when caffeine was consumed less frequently. Smoking and caffeine consumption need to be considered in the interpretation of human biomonitoring data because they appear to affect the serum concentrations of these chemicals.
6125333	1. The joint action of DDT and PCB (Aroclor 1254) on blood parameters and heart rate was studied in the White Leghorn cockerel (Gallus domesticus). 2. PCB alone or combined with DDT reduced heart rate, this change being non-permanent since it returned to normal values when the contaminated diet was replaced by normal diet. 3. PCB alone or combined with DDT had a detrimental effect on packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration and total erythrocyte count. Hemoglobin concentrations from the experimental group remained lower than control values after removal of the contaminated diet. 4. An antagonistic action rather than a synergistic or additive effect in blood parameter was observed in birds after being exposed to PCB-DDT mixture.
9587783	1 The aim of this study was to ascertain the reproductive effects of PCB 77 on adult male rats and to determine its concentration in the liver and testis. Adult male rats (n = 15/group) were treated subcutaneously with a single dose of 18 mg/kg bw (PC18) or with 60 mg/kg bw (PC60). The substance was dissolved in a 10 ml volume of peanut oil/kg. Control rats received the same volume of the vehicle. The reproductive effects as well as the concentration of PCB 77 in the liver and testis were investigated 1, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. 2 In both groups, the daily sperm production (DSP; x10(6)) remained permanently reduced in the PC18 as well as in the PC60 groups throughout the entire investigation period (DSP week 8: control: 31 +/- 7; PC18: 22 +/- 5; PC60: 20 +/- 7). The sperm number (x10(6)) per cauda epididymis was affected only at the 1st and 4th week after treatment (control week 1: 211 +/- 67; PC18 week 1: 135 +/- 62; PC60 week 1: 142 +/- 49). Moreover, a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm was observed 4 weeks following treatment in the PC18 and PC60 groups and 8 weeks after treatment in the PC60 group. Abnormal tails were the most frequent changes observed. 3 The relative testicular and prostata weights (g) were slightly increased in the PC60 group at the 1st and 4th week following treatment (testis weight: control/I: 0.46 +/- 0.02; PC60/I: 0.51 +/- 0.03). 4 The serum testosterone concentrations and effects on testis morphology were not reported. 5 The maximum concentration of PCB 77 was detected in the liver and testis 1 week after treatment. The concentration declined 4 weeks after treatment in both organs, but still a significant amount of PCB 77 was detectable in the liver as well as in the testis 8 weeks after treatment. 6 The results demonstrate that PCB 77 affects sperm variables when applied to adult rats and that the elimination of PCB 77 in the testis parallels that of the liver.
21476350	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among persistent polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons that exist as complex mixtures in the environment worldwide. The present study was attempted to investigate the hepatotoxicity following repeated exposure to TCDD and PCBs in combination in male rats, and to reveal the involvement of potential mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TCDD (10 microg/kg) and Aroclor 1254 (10 mg/kg, a representative mixture of PCBs) alone or in combination by intragastric administration. After 12-day exposure, all treatments produced significant hepatotoxicity as characterized by changes of plasma biochemistry and histopathological changes. These effects were more prominent in the combined group. Furthermore, all treatments induced hepatic cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression, and the maximal level of CYP1A1 expression was observed in the combined group, as in the case of the most severe hepatotoxicity evoked by the combined exposure. These findings indicated that the hepatotoxicity induced by TCDD and Aroclor 1254 might be ascribed to the high expression of hepatic CYP1A1. The present study demonstrates the enhanced hepatotoxicity after exposure to TCDD and PCBs in combination in rats.
18632132	OBJECTIVE: The objective was to grasp the recent body burden levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) and to investigate their determinants among general inhabitants in Japan. METHODS: This study was performed on 1374 participants aged 15-73 years, who were not occupational exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs, living widely in 75 different residential areas of 25 prefectures in Japan. Seven PCDDs, ten PCDFs, twelve DL-PCBs, which are assigned a toxicity equivalent factor, and biochemical factors were determined in fasting blood. A questionnaire survey on life-style was also performed. RESULTS: The median of total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) was 20pgTEQ/g lipid. The TEQs of PCDDs/PCDFs, DL-PCBs and total TEQ increased with age. The intake frequency of fish-and-shellfish was positively associated with the TEQ of DL-PCBs in both sexes. Current smoking was negatively related to the TEQ of DL-PCBs in male subjects but not in female subjects. Feeding status was significantly related to the TEQs of PCDDs/PCDFs, DL-PCBs and total TEQ, being lowest in breast feeding and highest in never and bottle feeding. According to the results of subgroup analysis, parity was not associated with the TEQs. CONCLUSIONS: The fish-and-shellfish consumption may contribute to the accumulation of DL-PCBs, and smoking may induce some biological action for the elimination of DL-PCBs from the human body. Breast feeding is considered to be one of the major excretory pathways of PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs in women, while parity may not largely contribute to the elimination of these pollutants. 
27316864	The effects of a single administration of ethanol after feeding a PCB-containing diet on tissue ascorbic acid, drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver, and serum and liver lipids of rats were investigated. Male Donryu and Wistar rats that had been fed on a 20% casein diet with or without 0.03% PCB were given a 5g/kg of body weight ethanol solution (25%, w/v) via a stomach tube, and then killed 16h after the intubation. Intake of the PCB-containing diet accelerated the disappearance of blood ethanol. Dietary PCB and a single dose of ethanol independently affected the tissue levels of ascorbic acid. The combined effect on hepatic aniline hydroxylase activity was additive or synergistic. A single dose of ethanol did not significantly affect the hepatic aminopyrine N-demethylase activity. In Donryu rats, the effects from feeding on a PCB-containing diet and those from a single dose of ethanol on serum lipids were almost additive. In Wistar rats, the effects of ethanol alone on lipids were not necessarily apparent, but the effects of ethanol after feeding with the PCB-containing diet were strongly enhanced. Ethanol alone hardly affected the liver lipids. Most lipids that were increased by PCB alone were significantly decreased or tended to be decreased by a single dose of ethanol. The serum levels of GOT and GPT were markedly increased by a single large dose of ethanol concomitant with the PCB-containing diet in both strains of rats; however, PCB alone or ethanol alone hardly changed the serum levels of GOT and GPT. These results indicate that the effects of a single large dose of ethanol on drug and lipid metabolism, and on the liver function were markedly modified by the intake of a PCB-containing diet. 
18439647	The purpose of this study was to establish an economic and efficient method to screen total PCBs and total dioxins (PCDDs+PCDFs+Co-PCBs) in the highly exposed people in Japan. In this paper, we suggest use of total PCBs in human blood to represent other persistent organic pollutants, especially dioxins. Twenty blood samples were collected from Japanese volunteers. Total PCBs and total dioxins (PCDDs+PCDFs+Co-PCBs) were detected from all twenty blood samples. We carried out detailed analysis of correlation between concentration of total PCBs and each dioxin congener with both measured value and TEQ calculated value. The mean concentration of total PCBs was 250 ng g-fat(-1), and the mean concentration of total dioxins was 37 ng g-fat(-1) or 40 pg TEQ g-fat(-1). Correlations between the total PCBs (ng g-fat(-1)) and the total measured dioxins (ng g-fat(-1)), and between the total PCBs (ng g-fat(-1)) and the total dioxin TEQ calculated value (pg-TEQ g-fat(-1)) were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. It became clear that the concentrations of total PCBs in human blood is a good indicator of the concentrations of total dioxins in Japan. If a mass screening is conducted on women of reproductive age in order to detect highly exposed women, it is possible that women with the highest contamination may be treated in order to decrease the levels of these chemicals before pregnancy. In conclusion, measurement of total PCBs concentration is useful for exposure assessment of dioxins in human blood.
9878591	Our previous in vitro studies with both isolated organelles and primary neuronal cell cultures found that intracellular signal transduction can be perturbed by some noncoplanar PCBs at exposure levels of </=10 microM. However, it is not clear whether such concentrations are achievable in brain in vivo. Also, the pattern of congener disposition and quantities of the PCB accumulation in tissues of animals exposed to commercial PCB mixtures is not well studied. In the present study, we have conducted PCB congener-specific analysis in different brain regions, liver, blood, and fat of adult male Long-Evans rats dosed orally with Aroclor 1254 (0 or 30 mg/kg/day; once per day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks) in corn oil. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, rats were euthanized, and the brains were removed and dissected to obtain cerebellum, frontal cortex, and striatum. Liver, blood, and fat samples were also collected at the same time. Congener-specific analysis of PCBs was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. While PCB concentrations in control rat brain regions were less than 0.02 ppm, total PCB congeners in treated animals accumulated to much higher levels. Total levels in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and striatum were 15.1 +/- 0.3, 13.1 +/- 1.7, and 8.2 +/- 2.6 ppm, respectively. The levels of PCBs in the fat, liver, and blood were 0.041, 0.002, and 0.001 ppm in control rats and 552, 38.3, and 1.6 ppm in treated rats, respectively. In addition to the differential total uptake between tissues, there was differential accumulation of PCBs with respect to the number of chlorines. In all the tissues, the more lightly chlorinated (tetra- and penta-) congeners accumulated less than their respective proportions in the parent Aroclor 1254 mixture. On the other hand, heavily chlorinated (hexa- to nona-) congeners accumulated more than the proportion of these congeners found in Aroclor 1254 mixture. This shift toward accumulation of heavily chlorinated congeners seems to be more pronounced in the brain than liver and fat. Predominant congeners (5-32% of total PCBs) detected in different brain regions, blood, liver, and fat are: 2,3,3',4',5,6- (no. 163) + 2,2',3,4,4',5- (no. 138) (coeluted); 2,2',4,4',5,5'- (no. 153) + 2, 2',3,3',4,6'- (no. 132) (coeluted); 2,3,3',4,4',5- (no. 156) + 2,2', 3,3',4,4',6- (no. 171) (coeluted); 2,3',4,4',5- (no. 118); 2,2',4,4', 5-(no. 99); and 2,3,3',4,4'- (no. 105). These congeners together accounted for about two thirds of the total PCB load in brain. All these predominant congeners are ortho-substituted and therefore are noncoplanar in nature. The total PCB concentrations accumulated in brain were as high as 50 microM (based on average molecular weight of 326.4 for Aroclor 1254) and, at these concentrations, intracellular second messengers were significantly affected in neuronal cultures and brain homogenate preparations in vitro. These results indicate that concentrations that altered Ca2+ disposition and second messenger systems in vitro are achievable in brain in vivo following repeated exposure.
16114233	A simple off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) method for isolation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) from human serum has been developed. The procedure includes denaturation of serum proteins by a mixture of water-1-propanol, application of the sample by aspiration twice repeatedly through the SPE column and elution with a mixture of n-hexane-dichlormethane. After final clean-up the compounds of interest were analysed by gas chromatography with micro-electron capture detection (GC-microECD). The recoveries achieved for PCB congeners using spiked porcine serum samples were 99-120% and for OCPs 88-115%. Relative standard deviations (RSD) ranged from 3 to 7%. The method was applied to real human serum samples and the recoveries of analytes in the serum were proportionally recalculated considering the recovery of the internal standard PCB-174. PCB-103 served as a syringe standard to correct volume of samples analysed. The aim of this study was to develop an effective off-line SPE procedure by optimization of existing SPE methods to supply laborious, solvent- and time-consuming liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in routine analytical process.
10595720	A method for the isolation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from human blood using solid-phase extraction (SPE) has been developed. The procedure incorporates decomposition of lipids by concentrated sulphuric acid directly on the SPE column. Conditions for transferring PCBs onto the SPE column and washing the decomposed blood components from the SPE column were optimised. After clean-up the extracts were analysed using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. An average recovery of PCBs from spiked blood samples was about 78+/-8% and an average precision was about 109+/-7%. Quantitation has been done using four internal standards and calibration curves based on five concentration levels. Low procedural blanks made it possible to determine PCBs in blood quantitatively at a level down to 2-10 pg g(-1). The integrated method for blood is fast, less laborious than methods using liquid-liquid extraction and has a low consumption of organic solvents.
15809109	In 1979, about 2000 people in central Taiwan were intoxicated via rice oil consumption that was contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This "Yu-cheng" incident was one of the two known major human PCB intoxication episodes. Twenty years after the intoxication, serum samples of 435 Yu-cheng victims, 414 adults and 21 children, were collected. Sixteen PCB congeners were analyzed with a gas chromatograph-electron capture detector. We found the median concentration of total PCBs in the adult serum was 1500 ng/g lipid, still substantially higher than that of the general population in Taiwan (3.7-fold) and most seafood consumers in the world. Most of analyzed PCB congeners in children were below or around the detection limits. Congener #138, however, had the highest concentrations, approximately accounting for 55% and 29% in the child and adult groups, respectively. Given that PCBs are persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disruptors, the concentrations and congener-specific profiles regarding the Yu-cheng victims provide valuable information for the investigation of such chemicals in humans.
8013129	There are 209 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the metabolism and toxicity of which vary by congeners. Use of PCBs is now restricted, but environmental contamination and human exposure persist. Analysis for "total PCBs" in biological samples gives limited information; congener-specific analysis is far more informative, but more complicated. Concentrations of congeners in serum/plasma, adipose tissue, or milk are useful biomarkers of exposure. Lipids may contain similar concentrations and congener patterns, but these vary between exposures and are different from those of the corresponding exposure mixtures; hence, analysis of lipids cannot be used to identify the original exposure. Some non- and mono-ortho congeners may attain a coplanar conformation, which renders them capable of a dioxin-like action. Toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) have been used to sum that risk as toxic equivalents (TEQs), which are considerably different from congener concentrations. No reliable data have been developed on the relationship between concentrations of "total PCBs" or congeners in biological samples and effects of PCBs on human health, mainly because of the various analytical procedures involved and confounding exposures.
7757209	Basic parameters associated with practical application of gas chromatography coupled with microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometric detection GC-MIP-AED in the determination of seven "indicator" polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in biotic matrices were evaluated. The detection limit for chlorine (Cl-479) was found to be 0.54 pg/s. Under the conditions used for sample analysis (1 microliters of purified extract injected into the GC-MIP-AED system represented 2.5 mg of original fat), this value corresponded approximately to 0.15 mg/kg of the respective congeners in fat. The detector response was linear within the tested range of 0.5-10 ng of each injected PCB. The relative standard deviation of repeated injections for the lowest concentration level of 0.5 ng of PCB per injection ranged between 10.5 and 34.4% depending on the chlorine content of the individual analytes. The results demonstrate a high selectivity of chlorine detection. Carbon (C-496) chromatograms recorded simultaneously demonstrated the efficiency of the clean-up step used. Quantitative results (analytes at levels of 0.1-1 mg/kg) obtained with the atomic emission detector did not differ significantly from those recorded with a conventional electron-capture detector.
3094462	A pilot study was conducted to determine whether persons at high risk of exposure to three waste sites in the area of Bloomington, Indiana, have abnormally elevated serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels. In addition, we attempted to determine which environmental pathways might have contributed most to these exposures. First, a screening questionnaire survey of 995 individuals was conducted; on the basis of these data, 114 of the persons who had the greatest potential for exposure were selected for inclusion in this pilot exposure assessment study. People near these waste sites have higher average serum PCB levels, and a greater percentage have abnormally elevated serum PCB levels, compared with previously characterized populations in the United States. However, we could not distinguish specific pathways of exposure and uptake, with the exception of persons with occupational exposures and, possibly, among persons who reportedly salvaged metal from discarded electrical equipment. Exposures in this community require further evaluation.
22976994	SCOPE: The health consequences of lifelong low-level exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) via food are largely unknown, mainly due to the lack of large population-based prospective studies addressing this issue. We validated long-term food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-based dietary PCB exposure against concentrations of six PCB congeners in serum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dietary PCB exposure was estimated in the Swedish Mammography Cohort by constructing a recipe-based database of CB-153, an indicator for total PCBs in food. The Spearman rank correlation (adjusted for within-person variability) was assessed between concurrent (2004-2006), past (1997), and long-term (mean of 1997 and 2004-2006) FFQ-based dietary PCB exposure, respectively, and the following serum PCB congeners, CB-118, CB-138, CB-153, CB-156, CB-170, and CB-180, in women (56-85 years of age, n = 201). The correlation between FFQ-based dietary PCB exposure and serum CB-153 was 0.41 (p < 0.001) for the concurrent (median 1.6 ng/kg body weight) and 0.34 (p < 0.05) for the past (median 2.6 ng/kg body weight) exposure assessment. Long-term validity of FFQ-based PCB estimates and the six serum PCB congeners ranged from 0.30 to 0.58 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: FFQ-based PCB exposure estimates show acceptable validity in relation to PCB concentrations in serum, justifying their use in large-scale epidemiological studies. 
14602522	Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were collected to quantify the nature and prevalence of biomarker responses, including biochemical indices, toxicopathic lesions and general health indices, among fish collected from polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated and nearby uncontaminated reaches of the Kalamazoo River, Michigan, USA. Blood and tissue samples (gill, liver, spleen, head kidney, trunk kidney, thyroid and gonads) were collected and preserved at necropsy for biochemical and histological analyses. The body condition factor and liver somatic index were significantly lower in fish collected from the downstream, contaminated site. Plasma vitellogenin was not detected in male fish collected from either site. Liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity and liver and spleen superoxide dismutase activity were significantly depressed in fish collected from the downstream site. Significant toxicopathic lesions such as glycogen depletion, enhanced macrophage aggregates, hepatic foci of cellular alteration (i.e. preneoplastic lesions) and neoplasia were also detected in the liver of fish collected from the downstream site. This study indicates that many of the biochemical and histopathological biomarker responses were associated with liver and body tissue PCB concentrations. Taken together, the biomarkers of exposure and effect strongly suggest that fish within the downstream site are adversely affected by PCBs and other chemical stressors.
21565681	OBJECTIVE: To study correlations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DIOXIN, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) with thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) in children, and assess the impact on children's health. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty nine children aged from 6 to 8, including 195 from Luqiao, the computer E-waste recycling area, and 174 from Longyou, the control area, were selected for this investigation to elucidate the correlation of PCBs, DIOXIN, and PBDE with TSH in children's blood samples. The children had a physical examination and their blood levels of PCBs, DIOXIN, PBDE, and TSH were detected after sample collection. RESULTS: In the E-waste recycling area, the contents of PCBs, PBDE, DIOXIN, and TSH in the blood samples of children were 484.00 ± 84.86 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 664.28 ± 262.38 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 26.00 ± 19.58 ng·g(-1) lipid weight and 1.88 ± 0.42 μIU/mL (serum) respectively, while in the control area, the PCBs, PBDE, DIOXIN, and TSH contents were 255.38 ± 95 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 375.81 ± 262.43 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 39.64 ± 31.86 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, and 3.31±1.04 μIU/mL respectively. CONCLUSION: The health status of children in the control area are better than that in the contaminated area. Among children who are exposed to persistent organic pollutants, the pollutant content increases significantly in their serum, and the distribution of TSH levels in their bodies are also affected. 
16906772	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with a broad spectrum of human health problems and cause cancer in rodents. In addition, these compounds cause chromosomal aberrations in humans and treated human cells. Although the underlying basis for the chromosomal damage induced by PCBs is not understood, it is believed that these compounds act through a series of phenolic and quinone-based metabolites. Recent studies indicate that several quinones that promote chromosomal damage also act as topoisomerase II poisons. Therefore, the effects of PCB quinone metabolites (including mono and dichlorinated compounds and p- and o-quinones) on the activity of human topoisomerase IIalpha were examined. Results indicate that these compounds are potent topoisomerase IIalpha poisons in vitro and act by adducting the enzyme. They also increase DNA cleavage by topoisomerase IIalpha in cultured human cells. In contrast, incubation of topoisomerase IIalpha with PCB metabolites in the absence of DNA leads to a rapid loss of enzyme activity. On the basis of (1) the differential ability of quinone-treated enzyme to bind circular and linear DNA molecules and (2) the generation of salt-stable noncovalent complexes between topoisomerase IIalpha and circular plasmids in the presence of PCB quinones, it appears that these compounds alter enzyme function (at least in part) by blocking the N-terminal gate of the protein. Finally, exposure to quinones generates a protein species with a molecular mass approximately twice that of a monomeric topoisomerase IIalpha protomer. This finding suggests that PCB quinones block the N-terminal gate by cross-linking the protomer subunits of topoisomerase IIalpha.
1706122	1. Kidneys from rats given an intraperitoneal dose of 4,4'-bis[( 3H]methylsulphonyl)-2,2',5,5'- tetrachlorobiphenyl[(CT3SO2)2TCB)] contained (CT3SO2)2TCB associated with a protein which has been isolated and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblot and immunodiffusion analysis to be alpha 2 mu-globulin (alpha 2 mu). 2. The same radioactive alpha 2 mu-globulin complex was isolated from urine of rats given an i.p. dose of (CT3SO2)2TCB. This complex represented 12.3% (0.27% dose) and 9.3% (0.06% dose) of the radioactivity excreted in 0-24 h and 24-48 h urine, respectively. 3. The radioactivity was extractable from alpha 2 mu and characterized by t.l.c. (co-chromatography in two solvent systems) to be (CT3SO2)2TCB. 4. A radioactive-protein complex was isolated from urine of mice given an i.p. dose of (CT3SO2)2 TCB. The radioactive-protein complex was characterized to be mouse major urinary protein (MUP) by SDS-PAGE, immunoblot and immunodiffusion analysis. This complex was not detected in mouse kidney. 5. Urinary excretion of radioactive-MUP complex represented 51.7% (2.3% dose) and 28% (1.3% dose) of the radioactivity excreted in 0-24 h and 24-48 h urine, respectively.
23032644	BACKGROUND: Dioxins and PCBs accumulate in the food chain and might exert toxic effects in animals and humans. In large epidemiologic studies, exposure estimates of these compounds based on analyses of biological material might not be available or affordable. OBJECTIVES: To develop and then validate models for predicting concentrations of dioxins and PCBs in blood using a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire and blood concentrations. METHODS: Prediction models were built on data from one study (n=195), and validated in an independent study group (n=66). We used linear regression to develop predictive models for dioxins and PCBs, both sums of congeners and 33 single congeners (7 and 10 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDDs/PCDFs), 12 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs: 4 non-ortho and 8 mono-ortho), sum of all the 29 dioxin-like compounds (total TEQ) and sum of 4 non dioxin-like PCBs (∑ CB-101, 138, 153, 183=PCB(4)). We used the blood concentration and dietary intake of each of the above as dependent and independent variables, while sex, parity, age, place of living, smoking status, energy intake and education were covariates. We validated the models in a new study population comparing the predicted blood concentrations with the measured blood concentrations using correlation coefficients and Weighted Kappa (К(W)) as measures of agreement, considering К(W)>0.40 as successful prediction. RESULTS: The models explained 78% (sum dioxin-like compounds), 76% (PCDDs), 76% (PCDFs), 74% (no-PCBs), 69% (mo-PCBs), 68% (PCB(4)) and 63% (CB-153) of the variance. In addition to dietary intake, age and sex were the most important covariates. The predicted blood concentrations were highly correlated with the measured values, with r=0.75 for dl-compounds 0.70 for PCB(4), (p<0.001) and 0.66 (p<0.001) for CB-153. К(W) was 0.68 for sum dl-compounds 0.65 for both PCB(4) and CB-153. Out of 33 congeners 16 (13dl-compounds and 3 ndl PCBs) had К(W)>0.40. CONCLUSIONS: The models developed had high power to predict blood levels of dioxins and PCBs and to correctly rank subjects according to high or low exposure based on dietary intake and demographic information. These models underline the value of dietary intake data for use in investigations of associations between dioxin and PCB exposure and health outcomes in large epidemiological studies with limited biomaterial for chemical analysis. 
7850381	Dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous toxic compounds in the environment. Negative influences of these compounds on the health status of human beings have been described. Especially susceptible might be the fetus, which is exposed in utero, and the newborn breast-fed infant, since both are exposed to relatively high levels of dioxins and PCBs during a critical period of organ growth and development. We investigated PCB levels in 406 maternal plasma samples as well as PCB and dioxin levels in 172 human milk samples with relation to living area of women living for at least five years in the western industrialized part of the Netherlands or the northern more rural part. The western part was further subdivided into one urban and two highly industrialized areas. After correction for covariates, we found significantly higher levels of PCB 118 in maternal plasma as well as significantly higher levels of the dioxin-TEQ and of ten individual dioxin and PCB congener levels in human milk in the western more industrialized areas of the Netherlands compared to the northern more rural part. We did not find significant differences in planar, mono-ortho or di-ortho PCB-TEQ levels in human milk between all different areas. We conclude that significantly higher levels of a number of dioxin and PCB congeners are found in women living in industrialized areas compared to women living in rural areas in the Netherlands.
15519386	Impact of FEBRA (fermented brown rice with Aspergillus oryzae, a rich dietary fiber) intake on the concentrations of polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCBs), -dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs), -dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and -dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in blood of nine married Japanese were studied for 2 years. Concentrations of total PCBs (average+/-standard deviation) were greater 326,000+/-263,000 and 207,000+/-89,000 in FEBRA-intake and non-FEBRA-intake groups, respectively, on pg/g lipid (from now onwards data expressed on pg/g lipid). DLPCBs were second major contaminants 94,000+/-77,000 and 60,000+/-28,000, orderly in FEBRA-intake and non-FEBRA-intake groups. The concentrations of PCDD/DFs were several orders of magnitude lower than those of PCBs, whereas PCDDs were greater (433+/-233 and 512+/-511, in FEBRA-intake and non-FEBRA-intake groups, respectively) than PCDFs (56+/-50 and 43+/-35). Calculated toxic equivalency (TEQ) concentrations were 34+/-24 and 23+/-10 in FEBRA-intake and non-FEBRA-intake groups, respectively. In order to corroborate the impact of FEBRA, the changes of PCDD/DFs and PCB concentrations for 0.5-year, 1-year, 1.5-year, and 2-year samples were estimated from average concentration of 1-day before study commences and 1-week study samples. The results explicit FEBRA-intake group eliminated 7%, 33%, 45%, 36%, and 26% and non-FEBRA-intake group eliminated 8%, 28%, 36%, 31%, and 20% of DLPCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, PCDD/DF TEQ and total TEQ, respectively. This study is the first of its kind showing the possible elimination of PCDDs, PCDFs and their TEQ in humans from Japan after the consumption of FEBRA.
8757236	Human transition milk was sampled from 88 mothers at the Faroe Islands, where the seafood diet includes pilot whale meat and blubber. Milk mercury concentrations (median, 2.45 micrograms/liter) were significantly associated with mercury concentrations in cord blood and with the frequency of pilot whale dinners during pregnancy. Milk selenium concentrations (mean, 19.1 micrograms/liter) correlated significantly with concentrations in cord blood but not with seafood consumption. Arsenic concentrations were very low. Twenty-four of the milk samples were separated into four pools based on fish intake and milk mercury concentrations. The polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations (1.8-3.5 micrograms/g lipid) were high and mainly due to congener numbers 153, 180, and 138. One pool contained a congener 77 concentration of 1380 ppt, which is the highest ever reported in a human specimen for a coplanar PCB. The highest PCB concentrations were seen in the pools from women who had eaten frequent whale dinners and whose milk contained high mercury concentrations. The concentrations of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans were not similarly elevated. Given the advantages associated with breast-feeding, advice to nursing mothers in this population should take into regard the possible risks associated with long-term exposure to milk contaminants.
16076757	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are persistent environmental pollutants shown to adversely interact with several functions of the endocrine system. In 1978-1979, over 2000 Taiwanese people ingested rice oil accidentally contaminated with PCBs and PCDFs. This is one of the major toxic exposure episodes that occurred globally and was later called Yucheng (oil disease in Chinese). The children born to exposed Yucheng women were therefore exposed in utero to high doses of PCBs/PCDFs. In 1995, 60 Yucheng and 61 control boys participated in physical examination, and serum hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Age, body weight, body height, Tanner status, testicular size, serum luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were not statistically different between Yucheng and control boys in the subgroups of before and at the age of puberty. However, the serum estradiol (E2) levels were significant higher in Yucheng boys at the age of puberty. Yucheng and control boys were further divided into two subgroups, those before (age <13 yr) and those at the age of puberty (age > or = 13 yr). There was a decrease of serum testosterone (TT) levels and increase of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in Yucheng boys at the age of puberty as compared with controls. There was a significant decrease of the square root of TT/E2 and TT/FSH; however, the square root of E2/FSH was increased in Yucheng boys at the age of puberty as compared with controls. Data indicated that prenatal exposure to PCBs and PCDFs may have implications for boys' sex hormone homeostasis at puberty. Further studies are needed to identify the congeners of PCBs/PCDFs responsible for disruption of the endocrine system, as well as the mechanisms of such disruption.
18093177	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants present in the food chain and in human blood and milk. Exposure to PCBs during pregnancy and lactation leads to cognitive impairment in children. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Some PCBs are endocrine disrupters. The aim of this work was to assess whether exposure of rats to PCB126 (dioxin-like) or PCB153 (non-dioxin-like) during pregnancy and lactation affects the ability of the pups to learn a Y maze conditional discrimination task and/or the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway in brain in vivo when the rats are young (3 months) or adult (7-8 months). After finishing the learning experiments, the function of the pathway was analysed in the same rats by in vivo brain microdialysis. The results obtained show that perinatal exposure to PCB153 or PCB126: (1) impairs learning ability in young but not in adult rats, (2) impairs the glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway function in cerebellum in vivo in young but not in adult rats and (3) affect these parameters in males and females similarly. PCB126 is around 10 000-fold more potent than PCB153. In control rats the function of the glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway and learning ability are lower in adult than in young rats. These age-related differences are not present in rats exposed to PCBs. The impairment of the glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway function induced at young age by developmental exposure to the PCBs could be one of the mechanisms contributing to the cognitive impairment found in children whose mothers ingested PCB-contaminated food during pregnancy and lactation.
17631943	We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (non-ortho PCBs), and mono-ortho coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (mono-ortho PCBs) in blood collected between 2002 and 2004 from 195 pregnant women living in Sapporo City of Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The present study is one of the few studies in which PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs have been measured in the blood of pregnant women. Of the 195 pregnant women, 101 were primipara (mean: 28.8 years) and 94 were multipara (mean: 32.4 years). The arithmetic mean total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs of primiparous and multiparous mothers in Sapporo City were 17.4 (median: 15.7) and 14.0 (median: 13.9)pgTEQ/glipid, respectively, and the concentrations were in the range of 6.6-43.4 and 3.4-28.2pgTEQ/glipid, respectively. In regard to the relationship between the total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in maternal blood and the number of deliveries or age of primiparous and multiparius mothers, the levels of these dioxin-like compounds tended to decrease with increases in the number of deliveries and significantly increased with increasing maternal age in both groups. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds and the age of primiparae and multiparae. The total TEQ concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs measured in 195 pregnant women has decreased compared to past levels in Japan for the last several decades. The results of the present study have indicated that dioxin contamination in the blood of young women in Japan is continuing to decrease.
2115777	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are abundant and persistent pollutants in the ecosystem. Commercial mixtures (e.g. Aroclor 1254) can contain up to 80 different isomers and congeners, many of which accumulate in biological systems by the ingestion of PCB-contaminated lipid components of food chains. PCBs are lipophilic and lipid-rich lipoproteins provide an excellent system to transport PCBs to tissues. We report here the distribution of PCBs between plasma fractions in the pigeon. Twenty-four hours after injection, [14C]4-monochlorobiphenyl and [14C]2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl were associated with the protein-rich HDL fraction and the lipoprotein-poor fraction (predominantly albumin), rather than with the lipid-rich VLDL and LDL fractions. Five days after injection with the commercial PCB mixture Aroclor 1254, there was a distinctive distribution between the plasma fractions of the 41 congeners detected. Avian species have a poorly developed lymphatic system and dietary lipids are secreted into the portal vein. To emphasize this route of entry, the lipoprotein particles formed are termed portomicrons rather than chylomicrons. The most striking result was that the lipid-rich portomicron and the VLDL fraction was associated almost exclusively with only one congener (2,2',4,4'5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl), whereas the other isomers and congeners were distributed amongst the LDL, HDL and the lipoprotein-poor (predominantly albumin) fractions. Thirteen of the congeners detected accounted for 74, 53 and 54%, respectively, of the total amount of PCBs in the LDL, HDL and lipoprotein-poor protein fractions. Five congeners that are highly toxic were enriched in the latter fraction. The distribution of PCBs is more complex than can be explained solely by their solubility in the lipid components of plasma fractions, and may suggest a complex association with apolipoproteins and plasma proteins that are important in transporting PCB to tissues. The identification of individual PCBs in lipoprotein fraction provides evidence for their role in the transport of lipophilic xenobiotics in blood and it is suggested that PCBs associated with lipoproteins are taken up by cells as lipoprotein-PCB complexes.
23452180	East Chicago, Indiana is a heavily industrialized community bisected by the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, which volatilizes ~7.5 kg/yr polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In contrast, the rural Columbus Junction, Iowa area has no known current or past PCB industrial sources. Blood from children and their mothers from these communities were collected April 2008 to January 2009 (n = 177). Sera were analyzed for all 209 PCBs and 4 hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs). Sum PCBs ranged from nondetect to 658 ng/g lw (median = 33.5 ng/g lw). Sum OH-PCBs ranged from nondetect to 1.2 ng/g fw (median = 0.07 ng/g fw). These concentrations are similar to those reported in other populations without high dietary PCB intake. Differences between the two communities were subtle. PCBs were detected in more East Chicago mothers and children than Columbus Junction mothers and children, and children from East Chicago were enriched in lower-molecular weight PCBs. East Chicago and Columbus Junction residents had similar levels of total and individual PCBs and OH-PCBs in their blood. Concentrations of parent PCBs correlated with concentrations of OH-PCBs. This is the first temporally and methodologically consistent study to evaluate all 209 PCBs and major metabolites in two generations of people living in urban and rural areas of the United States.
22424617	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of a gene-environment interaction between glutathione transferase (GST) gene polymorphisms (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, and GSTA1) and serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) levels. This is suggested as possible risk factors for endometriosis, a multifactorial gynecological disease. DESIGN: Case-control study conducted from 2002 to 2005. SETTING: Policlinico Umberto I, "Sapienza" University of Rome and Italian National Institute for Health, Rome. PATIENT(S): Italian women (N = 343), with laparoscopic diagnosis and histologic confirmation of the presence (cases, N = 181) or the absence (controls, N = 162) of endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): Genomic DNA extraction, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Determination of serum concentrations of selected PCBs by ion-trap mass spectrometry (subgroup, 63 cases and 63 controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endometriosis diagnosis by laparoscopy, GST genotypes, serum PCB levels. RESULT(S): The genotype distributions of GSTM1, GSTA1, and GSTP1 did not show any statistically significant difference between cases and controls. The GSTT1 null genotype was negatively associated with the disease. The GSTP1 wild-type genotype in the presence of medium-high blood levels of PCB153, total PCBs, or of high levels of PCB180 significantly increased the risk of endometriosis, suggesting a multiplicative interaction. CONCLUSION(S): The GSTs polymorphisms per se do not increase the risk of developing endometriosis. However, a gene-environment interaction was observed for GSTP1(Ile/Ile) and GSTM1 null genotypes, modulating the effect of PCB153, PCB180, and of total PCBs on disease risk. 
1425510	To assess the elimination of PCBs in humans, PCB concentrations in serum from 165 capacitor manufacturing workers were measured twice within a 46-month interval (March 1976-December 1979). Use of PCBs at the facility was entirely eliminated in 1977. PCB congeners with lower chlorination (LPCBs--mainly tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyls) had decreased in concentration, with six of the LPCB 7 peaks observed by packed column GC showing average reductions of 25-90%. Higher chlorinated PCBs did not decrease significantly as a whole, although three of the six constituent congener peaks showed some decline (15-25%). As expected, decreases in PCB congener concentrations were associated with chlorine substitution configurations known to be amenable to metabolism.
21664404	The testicular toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been extensively studied. However, the detailed mechanism is still obscure. In the present study, male C57 mice were treated with different doses of Aroclor 1254 (a commercial PCB mixture) once every 3 days by oral gavage. After exposure to Aroclor 1254 for 50 days, the sperm count decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Cell proliferation and apoptosis are key processes regulating development of the testis, and alterations in these processes may underlie testicular dysgenesis. Our results showed that the germ cell proliferation was inhibited and the apoptosis of the germ cell was induced in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with Aroclor 1254. Although there was no significant change in serum testosterone levels and androgen receptor expression levels after treatment with different dosages of Aroclor 1254, the estradiol levels decreased and the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) β increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an elevation of the expression of ERα was only observed in the 50μg/kg group. The data as a whole suggested that inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in germ cells, and a differential regulation of ER, may be involved in the testicular toxicity of PCBs.
8520928	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans) are potentially hazardous compounds. Since food is the major source (> 90%) for the accumulation of PCBs and dioxins in the human body, food habits in women determine the degree of fetal exposure and levels in human milk. In order to investigate an association between dietary intake and PCB and dioxin levels in human milk and PCB levels in maternal and cord plasma, the food intake of 418 Dutch women during pregnancy was recorded using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires. After adjusting for covariates, a weak association was found between the estimated dietary intake of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD), dioxins, and planar PCBs and their corresponding levels in breast milk. The estimated dietary intake of 2,3,7,8-TCDD, dioxins, and planar PCBs was also related to the PCB levels in maternal and cord plasma. Dairy products accounted for about half and industrial oils for about a quarter of the estimated 2,3,7,8-TCDD, dioxin, and the planar PCB intake. It is concluded that the contribution of a pregnancy related diet to PCB and dioxin levels in human milk and to PCB levels in maternal and cord plasma is relatively low. Decrease of exposure to PCBs and dioxins of the fetus and the neonate probably requires long-term reduction of the intake of these pollutants. Substitution of normal cheese by low-fat cheese and the use of vegetable oils instead of fish oils in the preparation of foodstuffs by the food industry could contribute to a reduced intake of PCBs and dioxins.
12765239	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may form reactive electrophiles that can bind covalently to hemoglobin in vivo. Female C57/BL6 mice, pretreated with phenobarbital and P-naphthoflavone, were injected with either radiolabeled 4-chlorobiphenyl, 3,3',4.4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) or the corresponding non-labeled 4-chlorobiphenyl, 3.3',4.4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, B[a]P or vehicle. Blood was collected at different time points. At 24 h a greater presence of 4-chlorobiphenyl and 3,3',4.4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl in the plasma, compared with the erythrocytes, was observed. For all three treatment groups the radioactivity in the hemolysate was found to be greater than the vehicle-treated group, except at 2 h after dosing, suggesting an association with hemoglobin. Covalent binding with globin was 10-fold greater for 4-chlorobiphenyl-treated animals compared with 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl-treated animals. Liquid chromatography-mass spectral analysis of globin was used to identify adducts. Our preliminary data show an increase in mass corresponding to adducts of oxidized metabolites of PCBs. Detection of adducts of PCBs with hemoglobin could provide a valuable tool to evaluate acute exposure of a population.
22142904	BACKGROUND: Lead (Pb) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are neurotoxic contaminants that have been related to impairment in response inhibition. OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined the neurophysiological correlates of the response inhibition deficits associated with these exposures, using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of school-age Inuit children from Arctic Québec exposed through their traditional diet. METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study, we assessed 196 children (mean age, 11.3 years) on a visual go/no-go response inhibition paradigm. Pb, PCB, and mercury (Hg) concentrations were analyzed in cord and current blood samples. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of contaminant levels to go/no-go performance (mean reaction time, percent correct go, percent correct no-go) and five ERPs [N2, P3, error-related negativity, error positivity (Pe), and correct response positivity (Pc)] after control for confounding variables. RESULTS: Current blood Pb concentrations were associated with higher rates of false alarms and with decreased P3 amplitudes to go and no-go trials. Current plasma PCB-153 concentrations were associated with slower reaction times and with reduced amplitudes of the Pe and Pc response-related potentials. Hg concentrations were not related to any outcome on this task but showed significant interactions with other contaminants on certain outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Pb exposure during childhood impairs the child's ability to allocate the cognitive resources needed to correctly inhibit a prepotent response, resulting in increased impulsivity. By contrast, postnatal PCB exposure appears to affect processes associated with error monitoring, an aspect of behavioral regulation required to adequately adapt to the changing demands of the environment, which results in reduced task efficiency. 
14657828	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation of prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure to child performance on neuropsychological tests of attention and information processing. Study design In this prospective, longitudinal study, assessment of prenatal PCB exposure was based on umbilical cord serum and maternal serum and milk concentrations. The children were tested in their homes at age 11 years. Multiple regression was used to examine the relation of this exposure to performance on 15 neuropsychological tests after controlling for a broad range of potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Adverse effects were seen primarily in children who had not been breast fed. Among these children, prenatal PCB exposure was associated with greater impulsivity, poorer concentration, and poorer verbal, pictorial, and auditory working memory. There was no evidence of visual-spatial deficit or increased hyperactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with earlier reports of greater vulnerability to prenatal PCB exposure in children who were not breast fed. It is not clear whether the protection offered by breast-feeding is caused by nutrients in breast milk or better quality of intellectual stimulation often provided by breast-feeding mothers. 
21177424	BACKGROUND: To date, breast cancer epidemiologic studies have relied on blood or tissue specimens sampled at the time of diagnosis or a few years prior to assess lifetime exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). In this study, we evaluated whether such PCB measurements are indicative of early-life levels by reconstructing lifetime toxicokinetic profiles for women included in the CECILE case-control study, using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. METHODS: We simulated lifetime toxicokinetic profiles of PCB-153 for 2,134 French women by incorporating information on body weight history, height, pregnancies, and breast-feeding in the PBPK model. Oral dose was calculated by considering measured blood PCB-153 and the temporal trend of environmental contamination. Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) for each decade of life and maximum blood concentration (C(max)) were compiled and compared with measured levels, using Pearson partial correlation analyses adjusting for age at diagnosis. RESULTS: When considering all individuals, simulated AUCs correlated with measured PCBs, with coefficients ranging from 0.735 to 0.981. The weakest correlations were obtained with AUCs for the first decades of life. Stratified analyses suggested that breast-feeding reduces the reliability of late-life blood levels in representing lifetime exposure. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that PCB levels measured at the time of diagnosis do not fully represent early-life exposures. IMPACT: PBPK-derived estimates of early-life levels circumvent the limitations of current approaches in assessing PCB lifetime exposure and may be used to address hypothesized windows of breast vulnerability (e.g., puberty) in this population. 
9007045	Several hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) identified in human serum have been synthesized and these include 2,2',3,4',5,5'-hexachloro-4-biphenylol; 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol; 2',3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol; 2,2',3,3',4',5-hexachloro-4-biphenylol; 2,2',3,3',4',5,5'-heptachloro-4-biphenylol; 2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachloro-4-biphenylol; and 2,2',3',4,4',5,5'-heptachloro-3-biphenylol. The hydroxy-PCBs exhibited minimal binding to the rat uterine cytosolic estrogen receptor (ER) and did not induce proliferation of estrogen-responsive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells at concentrations ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M. The estrogenic activity of these compounds was further investigated utilizing two estrogen-responsive in vitro bioassays, namely, (i) HeLa cells stably transfected with a Gal4:human ER chimera and a 17-mer-regulated luciferase reporter gene, and (ii) MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with a full-length human ER expression plasmid and a plasmid containing an estrogen-responsive vitellogenin A2 promoter linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. None of the hydroxy-PCBs significantly induced luciferase activity in the stably transfected HeLa cells or CAT activity in MCF-7 cells at concentrations as high as 10(-5) M. The antiestrogenic effects of the hydroxy-PCBs were also investigated using the same bioassays in which the cells were cotreated with 17beta-estradiol plus the hydroxy-PCBs. All of the hydroxy-PCB congeners inhibited one or more estrogenic response, and one congener, 2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachloro-4-biphenylol, inhibited 17beta-estradiol-induced cell proliferation and CAT activity in MCF-7 cells and luciferase activity in HeLa cells.
11716887	BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty whether environmental levels of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) adversely affect mental and motor development in early childhood. We aimed to establish whether such an effect is of only prenatal or additional postnatal origin, and if a favourable home environment can counteract this effect. METHODS: Between 1993 and 1995 we recruited 171 healthy mother-infant pairs and prospectively measured psychodevelopment in newborn infants aged 7, 18, 30, and 42 months. We estimated prenatal and perinatal PCB exposure of newborn babies in cord blood and maternal milk. At 42 months we measured postnatal PCB concentrations in serum. At 18 months the quality of the home environment was assessed using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale. Mental and psychomotor development of the children were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development until 30 months and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children at 42 months. FINDINGS: Negative associations between milk PCB and mental/motor development were reported at all ages, becoming significant from 30 months onwards. Over 30 months, for a PCB increase from 173 (5th percentile) to 679 ng/g lipids in milk (95th percentile) there was a decrease of 8.3 points (95% CI -16.5 to 0.0) in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development mental scores, and a 9.1 point decrease (95% CI -17.2 to -1.02) in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development motor scores. There was also a negative effect of postnatal PCB exposure via breastfeeding at 42 months. Home environment had a positive effect from 30 months onwards (Bayley Scales of Infant Development mental score increase of 9.4 points [95% CI 2.2-16.7]). INTERPRETATION: Prenatal PCB exposure at current European background levels inhibits, and a favourable home environment supports, mental and motor development until 42 months of age. PCB exposure also has an effect postnatally. 
9194418	Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are useful in describing the distribution, metabolism, and fate of xenobiotics across multiple species. The eventual goal of the present research is to create PBPK models for all 209 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Key parameters in any PBPK model are the tissue-to-blood partition coefficients. Tissue:blood partition coefficients relate the compound's concentration in a target tissue to its concentration in blood under equilibrium conditions. Data on the adipose:plasma partition coefficients of 24 PCBs were used in a regression analysis to find an expression for the adipose:plasma partition coefficient as a function of molecular structure. Using stepwise regression, it was found that three simple structural descriptors were sufficient to predict adipose:plasma partition coefficients for all 209 PCB congeners. Data on the distribution of PCBs among blood components were used to derive the adipose:blood partition coefficient from the adipose:plasma partition coefficient. The lipid contents of liver, muscle, and skin were used to derive the tissue:blood partition coefficient for those tissues from the adipose:blood partition coefficient. These results allow for the calculation of tissue:blood partition coefficients for liver, skin, muscles, and fat for all 209 PCB congeners.
23619185	The developing nervous system is a potential target of environmental contaminants such as polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE), which accumulate in the biosphere. We compared effects of 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromo-BDE (PBDE99), a PBDE congener present in environmental samples, and PCB on brain development. Time-pregnant rats were subcutaneously injected with PBDE99 (1 or 10mg/kg), the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (10mg/kg), or vehicle from gestational day 10-18. mRNA levels of genes involved in central control of reproductive functions and sexual behavior were analyzed by real time RT PCR in two sexually dimorphic brain regions, medial preoptic area (MPO) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of adult offspring of both sexes. Exposure to PBDE99 or the PCB mixture during pre- and postnatal development affected mRNA expression levels in a treatment-, region- and sex-specific manner, and changed the sensitivity of target genes to estradiol. The sex difference in progesterone receptor mRNA levels of VMH normally seen in untreated controls was abolished by both, PBDE99 and PCB. Estrous cycles were significantly affected, and preliminary experiments suggest an impairment of female sexual behavior. Our data indicate that developmental exposure to PBDE99 at doses below signs of general toxicity affects the regulation of estrogen target genes in rat brain. Since PBDE99 was detected in blood and adipose tissue of adult offspring, these effects may result from interactions with developmental processes, with adult functions, or a combination of both.
17521129	Polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and selected organochlorine pesticide concentrations were measured in blubber samples from 60 free-living harbor seals in 2003 from five sites around the United Kingdom coast. Significant regional differences among contaminant levels were found, with seals on Islay and Jura (southwest Scotland) having the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls and seals in the Wash (eastern England) having the highest polybrominated diphenyl ether levels. Animals from the north and northeast of Scotland (Orkney and the Moray Firth) had the lowest levels of all the contaminant groups studied. Congener-specific profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers showed relatively higher levels of the lower chlorinated and brominated compounds at the more northerly sites, with the lowest total levels of both chemical groups. Significant positive relationships between blubber contaminants and total triiodothyronine (TT3) concentrations were found after controlling for the potential effects of confounding because of sex, mass, and season. Increased serum TT3 levels were significantly related to higher blubber contaminant concentrations in the following order: sum of all contaminants > polybrominated diphenyl ethers > polychlorinated biphenyls > DDT. Serum TT3 levels in the harbor seals with the highest exposures might be indicative of a T3 thyrotoxicosis, but without information on free T3 and circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, it is difficult to determine the importance of this observation for the health of the individuals or populations. However, the mixture of contaminants to which United Kingdom harbor seals are exposed has changed over the last few decades, and the toxicological and epidemiological importance of adding the brominated compounds to the classical organochlorine and heavy metal mixture is not known.
18368012	In 2007, we published a paper in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology describing PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB serum concentration data collected for the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Since publication of this paper, several of the 1998 World Health Organization Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs), which were used to calculate the summary statistics we presented, have been changed. In this addendum, we publish new reference statistics using the WHO(2006) TEFs in addition to assessing the effect of these new TEFs on total TEQ concentrations for the general US population. We also examined the effect of the limits of detection (LODs) on the calculated TEQ summary statistics for the top seven contributing congeners and completed a missing data analysis to determine whether our estimates were biased by excluding individuals without complete congener profiles. Similar to our previous results, 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD; 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD; 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8-HxCDD; 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-PeCDF; and PCB 126 contributed the most to total TEQ. However, both PCB 156 and 157 were no longer significant contributors, instead being displaced by 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8-HxCDF, and PCB 169. In general, the decrease in TEFs for the mono-ortho-substituted PCBs decreased their contribution to total TEQ appreciably, causing TEQ(17-9) to approximately equal TEQ(17-3). The effect of LODs for five of the top seven contributing congeners was negligible; however, the LODs for 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8-PeCDD were noticeably higher and may impact TEQ estimates primarily for individuals aged 20-29 years. Results from the missing data analysis provide compelling evidence that the summary statistics we reported previously, as well as those described here, were not greatly influenced due to censoring data.
10438656	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are lipophilic industrial chemicals which are regularly detected in human breast milk, serum, and tissues. They possess hormone-modulating properties, and, when transferred transplacentally to the developing fetus, PCBs have been shown to induce persistent sex-specific neurobehavioral deficits. Interactions of PCBs with sex steroid-modulated neural differentiation could in part account for such effects. To test this hypothesis, female Long-Evans rats were exposed via food containing 40 mg/kg of either a reconstituted PCB mixture (RM), composed according to the congener-pattern in human breast milk, or the technical PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (A1254). The exposure period started 50 days prior to mating and was terminated at birth (postnatal day 0: PND 0). Aromatase (CYP 19) activity was determined in hypothalamus/preoptic area (HPOA) brain-sections from newborn male pups. This enzyme converts testosterone (T) to 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) and plays a key role in sexual brain differentiation. Moreover, serum concentrations of T and E(2), physical development, organ weights, exposure levels, and sex-specific behavior were evaluated at different life stages. On PND 0, a reduced aromatase activity was detected in the HPOA of male RM-pups compared to controls. Female RM-weanlings exhibited significantly elevated uterine wet weights on PND 21, which is a marker for estrogenic activity. In the adult stage (PND 170), male offspring with maternal exposure to either PCB mixture showed markedly reduced testes weights and serum testosterone levels, thus demonstrating persistent antiandrogenic effects. On PND 180, male RM-rats exhibited a behavioral feminization in a sweet preference test, suggesting long-lasting changes in neuronal brain organization caused by the perinatally suppressed aromatase activity. The results suggest that maternal exposure to the RM, the pattern of which is similar to the PCB spectrum in human milk, results in more distinct effects on sex steroid-dependent processes and behavior than the technical PCB mixture A1254. PCB levels in brain and adipose tissue of the exposed offspring lay within 1-2 orders of magnitude above background concentrations in humans.
6793700	Rats exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) or other xenobiotics exhibit an increase in tissue and urinary ascorbic acid, serum cholesterol and hepatic lipid peroxidation. To clarify the physiological role of ascorbic acid in exposure to PCB, we studied the influence of dietary levels of ascorbic acid (30-2,000 ppm) on the growth, serum lipids and hepatic lipid peroxidation in guinea pigs fed 50 ppm PCB-containing diets. The results showed that the growth depression due to PCB was ameliorated by increasing dietary ascorbic acid. The increases in serum cholesterol and phospholipid and in hepatic lipid peroxidation due to PCB were suppressed by larger amounts of ascorbic acid, which inversely correlated with the changes in growth. PCB intake also increased serum levels of cortisol and triglyceride, but these effects were not influenced by dietary level of ascorbic acid. The optimum requirement of ascorbic acid in the guinea pigs fed PCB was 800-2,000 ppm in the diet for the changes in the growth, serum cholesterol and hepatic lipid peroxidation.
11138666	There are limited data on the concentrations of common contaminants--polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (pp'-DDE) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)--in umbilical cord blood. Cord blood provides the primary direct measure of prenatal exposure to these contaminants, the key determinant of PCBs' neurodevelopmental toxicities. The objective of this study was to characterize cord blood levels of PCBs, pp'-DDE, and HCB among 751 infants who were born between 1993 and 1998 to mothers residing adjacent to a PCB-contaminated harbor in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and for whom the neurodevelopmental toxicities of these compounds are being studied. We refined standard analytic methods to optimize the sensitivity and precision of trace-level PCB, p,p'-DDE, and HCB measurements in blood. Using these methods, we measured the concentrations of 51 individual PCBs, their sum (sum(PCB)), p,p'-DDE, and HCB in cord serum. With correction for background contamination, the respective mean+/-SD cord serum concentrations of sum(PCB), p,p'-DDE, and HCB were 0.54+/-0.83, 0.48+/-0.94, and 0.03+/-0.04 ng/g serum. These concentrations were generally lower than those in most of the few published studies with congener-specific measures of PCBs in cord blood. However, for less-chlorinated PCB congeners (e.g., congeners 99 and 118), study samples had concentrations comparable to those in other populations, including groups at risk for high dietary PCB exposure. Of note, the contaminated harbor sediment has a relatively high proportion of less-chlorinated PCB congeners. Thus, although the sum(PCB) in study infants was not higher than concentrations in infants studied elsewhere, the relative predominance of less-chlorinated congeners was generally consistent with the characteristics of the contaminated site.
12739868	We experimentally examined the effects of dietary exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on adrenocortical function in American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Nine captive male American kestrels previously exposed to a PCB mixture (Aroclor 1248:1254:1260; 1:1:1) in their diet were subjected to a standardized capture, handling and restraint protocol designed to produce an increase in circulating corticosterone. A similar protocol has been applied to a wide range of avian species and was used here to evaluate the response of PCB-exposed and control kestrels to a defined physical stressor. Both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels were significantly lower in PCB-exposed birds when compared with control birds of the same age. PCB-exposed birds exhibited significantly lower corticosterone levels during the corticosterone response when compared with control birds, independent of body condition. Furthermore, baseline corticosterone concentrations exhibited a hormetic response characterized by an inverted U-shaped dose response in relation to total PCB liver burden. These results support several recent studies which report decreased levels of circulating corticosterone in PCB-exposed wild birds. The results presented here provide the first evidence that exposure to an environmentally relevant level of PCBs (approximately 10 mg/kg body weight) can impair the corticosterone stress response in kestrels, potentially increasing the susceptibility of birds to environmental stressors such as severe weather and predatory and human disturbance.
9572157	The present study aimed to assess the role of fish consumption for the body burden of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in mothers living in the Aland and Turku archipelago in Finland. The overall objective was to investigate whether there exists an appropriate population for a full-scale prospective study on PCB-related developmental effects in infants. Concentrations of the four major PCBs were determined in whole venous blood and cord blood from 30 delivering mothers, of which 20 subjects consumed fatty fish from the Baltic Sea (2.5-12.5 meals per month) and the remaining 10 mothers did not. The concentrations of CB-118, CB-138, CB-153, and CB-180 in cord blood were generally two- to threefold lower than in whole blood from the mothers, but strong correlations were observed between PCBs in the two matrices (r = .67-.80). Neither the venous blood nor cord blood concentrations of PCBs, however, were correlated with stated fish intake. Moreover, the concentration of CB-153 in plasma was only weakly associated with fish intake, and the level of organic mercury in erythrocytes was not correlated with fish intake at all. The present results of CB-153 concentrations in women's blood are lower than those reported in other recent investigations. A reasonable contributing explanation is the rapid decline during the last decades of PCB in Baltic Sea fish, which has resulted in less impact of fish intake on the body burdens of PCB in relatively young women (median 30 yr in the present study) as compared with older females. The relatively low PCB levels in blood taken together with the low number of yearly deliveries in the archipelago population makes it an inappropriate study base for a prospective study of PCB-related health effects in infants.
19786508	Serum total thyroxine (T(4)) and free T(4) levels were markedly decreased 7 days after treatment with 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB126) (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) in 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-sensitive C57BL/6 mice but not in TCDD-resistant DBA/2 mice. At the same time, the level and activity of hepatic T(4)-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (T(4)-UGT) were significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice. Furthermore, the amounts of biliary [(125)I]T(4) and [(125)I]T(4) glucuronide after injection of [(125)I]T(4) were increased by CB126 pretreatment in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice. Clearance of [(125)I]T(4) from serum was also promoted by CB126 pretreatment in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice. On the other hand, no significant changes in the steady-state volumes of distribution of [(125)I]T(4) and in the concentration ratio (K(p) value) of the liver to serum by CB126 pretreatment were observed in either strain of mice. Because liver weight was increased by CB126 pretreatment in C57BL/6 mice but not in DBA/2 mice, hepatic total [(125)I]T(4) was increased only in C57BL/6 mice. The present findings indicate that CB126-mediated decrease in serum T(4) occurs through the increase in hepatic T(4)-UGT and the enhanced accumulation of hepatic T(4) along with development of liver hypertrophy.
15707680	Thyroid hormones (THs) are important for brain development, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) accumulation in humans is a serious problem because PCBs may affect TH functions. To determine the effects of hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (OH-PCBs) on brain development, we performed mouse cerebellar culture assays. 4-OH-2',3,3',4',5'-pentachlorobiphenyl and 4-OH-2',3,3',4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl significantly inhibited the TH-dependent extension of Purkinje cell dendrites even at 5 x 10(-11) M and 5 x 10(-12) M, respectively. OH-PCBs may disturb TH-dependent brain development.
15325145	Persistent methyl sulfone (MeSO2-) and hydroxylated (HO-) polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) metabolites have emerged as important classes of environmental contaminants in vertebrate, aquatic biota and humans. In the present study, PCB, MeSO2-PCB and HO-PCB concentrations and congener patterns were determined in the whole blood and adipose tissue of male (n = 7) and female (n = 12) polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of random age (3-25 years of age), and collected in 1999-2001 from the Ittoqqortoormiit/Scoresby Sound area in central East Greenland. There was no significant difference (P < 0.05) between males and females with respect to PCB or PCB metabolite concentrations in either tissue. The mean sum (Sigma) PCB concentrations were 7020+/-3366 ng/g lipid weight (lw) (range 2708-18148 ng/g lw) and 46.1+/-44.6 ng/g wet weight (ww) (range 12.6-204.2 ng/g ww) in adipose and blood, respectively. The mean Sigma-HO-PCB concentration in whole blood was 182.3+/-72.1 ng/g ww (range 93.8-382.1 ng/g ww). The mean Sigma-HO-PCB to Sigma-PCB concentration ratios in whole blood were 4.59+/-3.58 (range 1.03-11.88) and 8.30+/-5.56 (range 2.16-19.47) in females and males, respectively, which are the highest ratios reported so far for polar bears from any population, or for any free-ranging animal. Sigma-HO-PCB concentrations were greater than all other major classes of organochlorines (i.e. Sigma-PCBs, Sigma-MeSO2-PCBs, Sigma-chlordanes (CHLs), Sigma-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and Sigma-chlorobenzenes (CBzs). The mean Sigma-MeSO2-PCB concentrations were 699+/-836 ng/g lw (range 127-3920 ng/g lw) and 10.9+/-9.6 ng/g ww (range 4.3-52.1 ng/g ww) in the adipose and blood, respectively. Regardless of age and sex, in both adipose and whole blood the MeSO2-PCB congener pattern was dominated by 3'- and 4'-MeSO2-CB101 and -CB87, and 4-MeSO2-CB149 (approx. 70% of the Sigma-MeSO2-PCBs). Minor differences in the MeSO2-PCB congener pattern were observed between blood and adipose, which suggests the possible influence of metabolite structure on mobilization and/or deposition to the adipose tissue. Sixteen HO-PCB congeners and one di-HO-PCB congener were identified, and five HO-PCB isomers and one di-HO-PCB isomer were detected. However, congener patterns were dominated by 4'-OH-CB120, 4-HO-CB146/3-HO-CB153, 4-OH-CB187, 4'-HO-CB172, 4-HO-CB193 and 4,4'-di-HO-CB202 (> 10 ng/g ww). HO-PCB congener patterns in whole blood were not significantly different (P < 0.05) between males and females. Other chlorinated phenolic contaminants, pentachlorophenol (0.3+/-0.3 ng/g ww) and 4-HO-heptachlorostyrene (7.5+/-2.9 ng/g ww) were also detected in blood. To our knowledge, this is to first report comparing PCBs, MeSO2-PCBs and HO-PCBs in whole blood and adipose tissue in a free-ranging wildlife species. HO-PCBs and MeSO2-PCBs are both important circulating contaminants in polar bears from this eastern Greenland population. Given the known toxicities of PCB metabolites, this population of polar bear may be experiencing health risks due to exposure to a complex loading of organohalogen contaminants that include HO-PCB and MeSO2-PCB metabolites.
11706375	A growing number of studies have reported phenolic halogenated compounds (PHCs) that are retained in the blood of humans and wildlife. These PHCs may be industrial chemicals; metabolites thereof, as in the case with polychlorobiphenylols (OH-PCBs); or of natural origin. The present study was aimed to identify hitherto unknown PHCs in human plasma with chemical structures that are consistent to PHCs known to possess endocrine-disrupting activity. For this purpose, samples of blood plasma from 10 randomly selected male blood donors from Sweden were pooled and analyzed by GC/ECD and GC/MS. Brominated, bromochlorinated, and chlorinated methyl derivatives of phenols and OH-PCBs were synthesized to be used as authentic reference standards. More than 100 PHCs were indicated in the plasma, and among those a total of 9 monocyclic brominated or chlorinated phenol-, guaiacol-, and/or catechol-type compounds were identified as their methylated derivatives. The two major compounds were 2,4,6-tribromophenol and pentachlorophenol. Thirty-eight OH-PCB congeners were structurally identified on two GC columns of different polarity. The origin of the OH-PCB metabolites in the context of their parent PCB congeners are suggested. Other PHCs identified in the male plasma were Triclosan (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy] phenol), a common bactericide; 4-hydroxy-heptachlorostyrene, a metabolite of octachlorostyrene; and 3,5-dibromo-2-(2,4-dibromophenoxy)phenol, a natural compound and a potential metabolite of polybrominated diphenyl ethers.
9551809	A broad range of pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated hydrocarbons (PCHs), polynitrohydrocarbons (PNHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OCs) insecticides were simultaneously analyzed in spiked soil, water or plasma samples by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Water and plasma samples containing the pollutants were extracted by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using florisil columns. The soil samples, fortified with the toxicants, were extracted with water, methanol or dichloromethane (DCM). The water extract was processed by the SPE method. The methanol and DCM samples were dried, dissolved in acetonitrile and subjected to the SPE extraction. The extracted samples were analyzed by GC-MS programmed to monitor selected ions. The deuterium labelled compounds were used as the internal standards. The chromatographic profile of total ions indicated complete separation of some compounds such as isophorone, naphthalene, all PCBs, most OC insecticides and PNHs; high Mr PAHs and some PCHs were partially or incompletely separated. The chromatographic profile of individual ion indicated good separation of each ion. The minimum detection limit ranged from 1 to 4 pg injected when 1 or 2 ions were monitored or from 20 to 200 pg injected when 20 ions were monitored. The SPE method that provided 60-105% recovery of pollutants from water samples, provided only 2-60% recovery from plasma samples. This may be due to the binding of pollutants to plasma proteins. Water recovered 1-30%, while methanol or DCM recovered 65-100% of the pollutants added to the soil samples. The use of internal standards corrected for the loss of pollutants from plasma or soil.
16135941	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial chemicals that were used widely for approximately 50 years. Now banned, they are still ubiquitous because of their persistence in the environment, the food chain, and human fatty tissue. High in utero exposures cause developmental deficits accompanied by growth retardation. Studies examining intrauterine growth at lower exposures have been inconsistent, with most such investigations having relied on surrogate exposure indicators such as consumption of fish from contaminated bodies of water. METHODS: In the 1960s, serum specimens were collected from pregnant women participating in the Child Health and Development Study in the San Francisco Bay Area. The women were interviewed and their serum samples stored at -20 degrees C. At 5 years of age, detailed anthropometric measurements were made on children born in the years 1964-1967. We measured PCBs in specimens from 399 mothers using gas chromatography/electron capture detection. We conducted multiple linear regression to examine the relationship between these organochlorine concentrations and both intrauterine and 5-year growth, with adjustment for medical, lifestyle, sociodemographic, and specimen characteristics. RESULTS: In male infants, higher total in utero PCB exposure was associated with reduced birth weight, head circumference, and weight-for-gestational age. An increase from the 10th to 90th percentile in total PCBs was related to 290 g lower birth weight, a 0.7-cm decrease in head circumference, and for weight for gestational age, a reduction in z-score of 0.6. In girls, smaller head circumference and shorter gestations were observed. In contrast, prenatal PCBs were associated with greater growth in 5-year-old girls, with no apparent effect in 5-year-old boys. CONCLUSIONS: Maternally mediated exposure to PCBs may be detrimental to fetal growth, particularly in boys. These effects apparently are not persistent. Interpretation of greater childhood growth of girls is unclear. 
19394084	Humans are exposed to different mixtures of PCBs depending on the route of exposure. In this study we investigated the potential contribution of inhalation to the overall human exposure to PCBs in an urban area. For this purpose, the mechanistically based, non-steady state bioaccumulation model ACC-HUMAN was applied to predict the PCB body burden in an adult living in the Midwestern United States who eats a typical North American diet and inhales air contaminated with PCBs. Dietary exposure was estimated using measured data for eighteen PCB congeners in different food groups (fish, meat and egg, dairy products). Two scenarios for inhalation exposure were evaluated: one using air concentrations measured in Chicago, and a second using air measurements in a remote area on Lake Michigan, Sleeping Bear Dunes. The model predicted that exposure via inhalation increases the accumulated mass of PCBs in the body by up to 30% for lower chlorinated congeners, while diet is by far the dominant source of exposure for those PCB congeners that accumulate most in humans.
19479025	BACKGROUND: The University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study (UMDES) was undertaken in response to concerns that the discharge of dioxin-like compounds from the Dow Chemical Company facilities in Midland, Michigan, resulted in contamination of soils in the Tittabawassee River floodplain and areas of the city of Midland, leading to an increase in residents' body burdens of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. OBJECTIVES: The UMDES is a hypothesis-driven study designed to answer important questions about human exposure to dioxins in the environment of Midland, where the Dow Chemical Company has operated for > 100 years, and in neighboring Saginaw, Michigan. In addition, the UMDES includes a referent population from an area of Michigan in which there are no unusual sources of dioxin exposure and from which inferences regarding the general Michigan population can be derived. A central goal of the study is to determine which factors explain variation in serum dioxin levels and to quantify how much variation each factor explains. CONCLUSIONS: In this article we describe the study design and methods for a large population-based study of dioxin contamination and its relationship to blood dioxin levels. The study collected questionnaire, blood, dust, and soil samples on 731 people. This study provides a foundation for understanding the exposure pathways by which dioxins in soils, sediments, fish and game, and homegrown produce lead to increased body burdens of these compounds. 
15893794	In 1978-1979, a mass poisoning occurred in central Taiwan from rice-bran oil contaminated by heat-degraded PCBs was later called the Yucheng (oil disease in Chinese). Only a few studies have so far investigated the levels of specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) or polychlorinated dibenzodioxin/furan (PCDD/F) congeners in the Yucheng victims. This study aimed to investigate the serum residual levels of thirty-three PCBs and seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F congeners in the Yucheng victims 15 years after the exposure. Forty-one blood samples were collected from individual Yucheng victims in 1994-1995. The mean levels of total 33 PCBs and 17 PCDD/Fs were 2468 ng/g lipid (13.3 ng/g sample) and 6550 pg/g lipid (30.9 pg/g sample) respectively. The higher levels were found in PCBs #99, #138, #153, #156, #170, #179, and #180 among 33 PCB congeners, while 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, and OCDD had the higher concentrations among 17 PCDD/F congeners. The total TEQ was contributed in decreasing order by 10 PCDFs (44%), three non-ortho-PCBs (24%), six mono-ortho-PCBs (20%), and seven PCDDs (12%). The mean total PCB levels and TEQ value of the 17 PCDD/Fs in the Yucheng victims 15 years after the toxic exposure were still 9 and 46 times higher than those in the general population in Taiwan. Principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that seven PCB congeners, PCBs #99, #138, #153, #156, #170, #179, and #180, accounted for 73% of the total variances in PCBs. On the other hand, six PCDD/F congeners, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF, and OCDD, accounted for 97% of the total variances in PCDD/Fs. In addition, PCA revealed that at least three characteristic patterns of congener profiles for PCBs were observed among the Yucheng victims. Similar trend was also observed for PCDD/Fs. These patterns may reflect distinctive exposure scenarios and/or different metabolizing capabilities among the Yucheng victims. We suggest that these patterns, in contrast to total PCB and PCDD/F levels, may be valuable for the future epidemiologic studies when linking exposure with specific health effect.
21962672	Since the CALUX (Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression) bioassay is a fast and inexpensive tool for the throughput analysis of dioxin-like compounds in a large number of samples and requires only small sample volumes, the use of this technique in human biomonitoring programs provides a good alternative to GC-HRMS. In this study, a method for the separate analysis of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) in human serum with the new sensitive H1L7.5c1 mouse hepatoma cell line was optimized. Sample dilution factors of 5 and 2.4 were selected for routine analysis of respectively the PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. The validation studies showed that repeatability and within-lab reproducibility for the quality control (QC) standard were within the in-house criteria. A long-term within-lab reproducibility of 25% for the PCDD/F fraction and 41% for the dl-PCB fraction for the analysis of pooled serum samples, expressed as pg BEQ/g fat, was determined. CALUX recoveries of the spiked procedural blanks were within the acceptable in-house limits of 80-120% for both fractions and the LOQ was 30.3 pg BEQ/g fat for the PCDD/Fs and 14.5 pg BEQ/g fat for the dl-PCBs. The GC-HRMS recovery of a C13-spiked pooled serum sample was between 60 and 90% for all PCDD/F congeners and between 67 and 82% for the non-ortho PCBs. An adequate separation between both fractions was found. The CALUX/GC-HRMS ratio for a pooled serum sample was respectively 2.0 and 1.4 for the PCDD/Fs and the dl-PCBs, indicating the presence of additional AhR active compounds. As expected, a correlation was found between human serum samples analyzed with both the new H1L7.5c1 cell line and the more established H1L6.1c3 cell line. The geometric mean CALUX-BEQ values, reported for the adolescents of the second Flemish Environment and Health Study (FLEHS II) recruited in 2009-2010, were 108 (95% CI: 101-114) pg CALUX-BEQ/g fat for the PCDD/Fs and 32.1 (30.1-34.2) pg CALUX-BEQ/g fat for the dioxin-like PCBs.
17938731	BACKGROUND: Brominated flame retardants, especially polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), have been widely used in North America, but little is known about the level of exposure of human populations to these compounds. OBJECTIVES: We set out to assess the internal exposure of postmenopausal Canadian women to selected organobromine compounds and to investigate factors associated with this exposure. METHODS: We measured concentrations of four PBDEs, one polybrominated biphenyl, and for comparative purposes, 41 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in plasma samples from 110 healthy postmenopausal women who were recruited at a mammography clinic in 2003-2004. RESULTS: PBDE-47 was the major PBDE congener, with a mean (geometric) concentration of 8.1 ng/g lipids and extreme values reaching 1,780 ng/g. By comparison, the mean concentration of the major PCB congener (PCB-153) was 41.7 ng/g and the highest value was 177 ng/g. PBDEs 47, 99, and 100 were strongly intercorrelated, but weaker correlations were noted with PBDE-153. As the sum of PBDEs (summation operatorPBDEs) increased, the relative contribution of PBDE-47 to the summation operatorPBDEs increased, whereas that of PBDE-153 decreased. PBDE-153 was the only brominated compound correlated to PCB-153. PBDE levels were not linked to any sociodemographic, anthropometric, reproductive, or lifestyle variables documented in the present study. Age and body mass index gain since the age of 18 years were significant predictors of PCB-153 plasma levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exposure to PBDE-47 likely occurs through direct contact with the penta-PBDE formulation, whereas exposure to PBDE-153 may originate in part from the food chain. 
21723585	Accumulated maternal dioxins are passed onto the fetus and neonate via the placenta and maternal milk. In Japan in 1968, an accidental human exposure to rice oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other dioxin-related compounds, such as polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), led to development of Yusho oil disease. We investigated differences in blood dioxin concentrations in mother-children pairs affected by the Yusho incident. From 2002 to 2008, blood samples were collected from 26 pairs of Yusho mothers and their children (19 mothers, 26 children). Specific congeners of seven polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), ten PCDFs, and four non-ortho PCBs were analyzed. The children had significantly lower TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs compared to their mothers. The mother-child difference in blood concentrations varied with the congeners; the largest for 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF and the smallest for 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptaCDD. The level for 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF, which characterizes Yusho oil disease, was approximately 17-30 times higher in the mothers than in the general population, whereas there were no significant differences between children in the formula-fed group and the general population. In contrast, the mean level for 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF in the breast-fed group was approximately 1.5 times, (range 0.5-6.5 times) higher than that in the general population. Over 30 years after the Yusho incident, the mean blood dioxin levels in the offspring were only a fraction of the levels in their mothers. This is more consistent with exposure via breast milk than via transplacental transfer in the Yusho incident.
17488503	Dietary POP exposure have shown negative effects on sperm motility and sperm chromatin integrity, as well as an increased proportion of Y-chromosome bearing sperms. However, it has been suggested that in epidemiological studies investigating persistent organochlorine pollutant (POP)-toxicity, other pollutants occurring simultaneously may carry an increased risk of effects, which may obscure a clear interpretation of the role of POP toxicity. One such pollutant is methyl mercury (MeHg), which has been found in fatty fish from the Baltic Sea and as a consequence men with a high consumption of such fish has been found to have twice the MeHg levels compared to men with a low fish consumption. The aim of the present study was to assess if exposure to MeHg affects male reproductive function, assessed by measuring human sperm motility, sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm chromatin integrity and the proportion of Y-chromosome bearing sperms. Secondly we also investigated a possible interaction between MeHg and 2, 2', 4, 4', 5, 5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), a biomarker for POP exposure, with respect to sperm outcome measures. Blood and semen samples were collected from 195 Swedish fishermen with a mean age of 47 (range 24-67 years). Blood levels of MeHg ranged from 0.11 to 16.59 microg/L (median 2.25 microg/L) and serum levels of CB-153 from 37 to 1460 ng/g lipid (median 190 ng/g lipid). The analyses revealed no association between MeHg and any of the outcomes investigated. Although men with low MeHg and high CB-153 had slightly higher DNA Fragmentation Index and fraction of Y-chromosome bearing sperms than men with low levels of both compounds, the effects were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we did not find any associations between MeHg exposure and semen quality or quantity in the dose range observed neither was any synergistic effects between MeHg and CB-153 noted.
119494	Long-term investigations of polychlorinated hydrocarbon levels in mothers' milk were made from 1969 to 1976. The levels of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin and PCB in mothers' milk were within the range reported by others. However, beta-BHC(Hexachlorocyclohexane) levels in the milk were 10 times that found in non-Japanese. A gradual decrease in the beta-BHC level in the milk was observed during this period. In contrast, the levels of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin and PCB were consistent for the 7-year period. A significant correlation between the levels of PCB and p,p'-DDE in mothers' milk and blood was observed in the 1974-1976 samples. However, after prohibition of the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons, this relationship was less apparent in the 1972-1973 samples.
15589659	Top-trophic predators like California sea lions bioaccumulate high levels of persistent fat-soluble pollutants that may provoke physiological impairments such as endocrine or vitamins A and E disruption. We measured circulating levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in 12 healthy juvenile California sea lions captured on Año Nuevo Island, California, in 2002. We investigated the relationship between the contamination by PCBs and DDT and the circulating levels of vitamins A and E and thyroid hormones (thyroxine, T4 and triiodothyronine, T3). Serum concentrations of total PCBs (sigmaPCBs) and total DDT were 14 +/- 9 mg/kg and 28 +/- 19 mg/kg lipid weight, respectively. PCB toxic equivalents (sigmaPCB TEQs) were 320 +/- 170 ng/kg lipid weight. Concentrations of sigmaPCBs and sigmaPCB TEQs in serum lipids were negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with serum vitamin A and T3, potentially reflecting PCB-related toxicity. A slight but not significant negative correlation (p < 0.1) was observed between serum T4 and the levels of sigmaPCBs and sigmaPCB TEQs. Conversely, no relationship was evident between the contaminant concentrations and vitamin E (p > 0.1). As juvenile California sea lions are useful sentinels of coastal contamination, the high levels encountered in their serum is cause for concern about the ecosystem health of the area.
18941588	BACKGROUND: Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated relationships between prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and modest cognitive impairments in infancy and early childhood. However, few studies have followed cohorts of exposed children long enough to examine the possible impact of prenatal PCB exposure on psychometric intelligence in later childhood. Of the few studies that have done so, one in the Great Lakes region of the United States reported impaired IQ in children prenatally exposed to PCBs, whereas another found no association. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine whether environmental exposure to PCBs predicts lower IQ in school-age children in the Great Lakes region of the northeastern United States. METHODS: We measured prenatal exposure to PCBs and IQ at 9 years of age in 156 subjects from Oswego, New York. We also measured > 50 potential predictors of intelligence in children, including repeated measures of the home environment [Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)], socioeconomic status (SES), parental IQ, alcohol/cigarette use, neonatal risk factors, and nutrition. RESULTS: For each 1-ng/g (wet weight) increase in PCBs in placental tissue, Full Scale IQ dropped by three points (p = 0.02), and Verbal IQ dropped by four points (p = 0.003). The median PCB level was 1.50 ng/g, with a lower quartile of 1.00 ng/g and an upper quartile of 2.06 ng/g. Moreover, this association was significant after controlling for many potential confounders, including prenatal exposure to methylmercury, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene, and lead. CONCLUSIONS: These results, in combination with similar results obtained from a similar study in the Great Lakes conducted 10 years earlier, indicate that prenatal PCB exposure in the Great Lakes region is associated with lower IQ in children. 
18719292	Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are used to prevent combustion in consumer products. Examples of BFRs are polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), and tribromophenol (TBP). These compounds are reported to have adverse effects on human health and endocrine disrupting effects. The purpose of this study was to identify the Japanese perinatal exposure to PBDEs, hydroxylated PBDE metabolites (OH-PBDEs), TBBPA, and TBP compared with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs). We investigated the concentrations of these compounds in maternal blood, maternal milk, cord blood, and umbilical cords from 16 Japanese mother-infant pairs by HRGC/HRMS. PBDEs were detected in all samples of maternal blood (mean+/-SD; median=25+/-23 pg/g; 18 pg/g wet weight), maternal milk (140+/-220 pg/g; 59 pg/g wet weight), cord blood (4.8+/-6.5 pg/g; 1.6 pg/g wet weight), and umbilical cords (3.1+/-3.1 pg/g; 2.1 pg/g wet weight). The mothers were divided into two groups, a high-concentration group and a low-concentration group. The percentage of BDE-47 showed the greatest difference between the two groups. 6-OH-BDE-47, TBBPA, and TBP were detected in all umbilical cord samples (mean+/-SD; median=8.4+/-8.1 pg/g; 8.0 pg/g, 16+/-5.5 pg/g; 15 pg/g, and 33+/-8.2 pg/g; 32 pg/g wet weight respectively), but not in all maternal blood or cord blood samples. These results indicate that OH-PBDEs, TBBPA, and TBP, in addition to PBDEs, PCBs, and OH-PCBs, pass through the blood-placenta barrier and are retained in the umbilical cord.
15686873	A wide variety of chemical and physical environmental stressors have been shown to alter the reproductive processes in fish by interfering with endocrine function. Most endocrine indicators or biomarkers are static measures from dynamic hormonally-mediated processes, and often do not directly relate to reproductive endpoints of ecological significance. Adequate production of the yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin, is critical for the survival and normal development of the sensitive egg and yolk-sac larval fish life stages. We developed a model that simulates vitellogenesis in a mature female sciaenid fish. The model simulates the major biochemical reactions over a 6-month period from the secretion of gonadotropin (GtH) into the blood to the production of vitellogenin. We simulated the effects of two endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that have different actions on vitellogenin production: a PCB mixture and cadmium. Predicted changes in steroid concentrations and cumulative vitellogenin production compared favorably with changes reported in laboratory experiments. Simulations illustrate the potential utility of our model for interpreting reproductive endocrine biomarkers measured in fish collected from degraded environments.
12631537	The relation between exposure to low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a class of persistent organic pollutants, and cognitive and motor development in young children has been examined in several studies, and results have varied. The authors evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to PCBs and children's neurodevelopment using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. Pregnant women were enrolled from 1959 to 1965 from 12 sites across the United States. PCBs were measured in maternal serum taken during pregnancy. To measure children's mental and psychomotor development at 8 months of age, the authors administered the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (means, 87 (standard deviation, 15) and 88 (standard deviation, 18), respectively). Overall, they did not observe a relation between prenatal PCB exposure and children's mental or psychomotor scores (n = 1,207; multivariate adjusted beta = 0.1 point per micro g/liter increase of PCB, p = 0.71, and beta = 0.5, p = 0.14, respectively). The PCB-psychomotor score relation varied by study center (p < 0.05): The association was direct in some centers, inverse in others. This could not be attributed to variation in the timing or measurement of the child's neurodevelopment or analysis of PCBs because these were standardized across centers. The reasons for variation in results within this study and across other studies remain unclear.
17639023	We have previously suggested that the decrease in the levels of serum total thyroxine (T(4)) and free T(4) by a single administration to rats of Kanechlor-500 (KC500) at a dose of 100 mg/kg is not necessarily dependent on the increase in hepatic T(4)-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT). In the present study, we determined whether or not a consecutive treatment with KC500 at a relatively low dose (10 mg/kg i.p., once daily for 10 days) results in a decrease in the level of serum total T(4) and further investigated an exact mechanism for the KC500-induced decrease in the T(4). At 4 days after final treatment with KC500, the serum total T(4) and free T(4) levels were markedly decreased in both Wistar and UGT1A-deficient Wistar (Gunn) rats, whereas significant increases in hepatic T(4)-UDP-GT activity were observed in Wistar rats but not in Gunn rats. The level of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was not significantly changed in either Wistar or Gunn rats. Clearance from serum of the [(125)I]T(4) administered to the KC500-pretreated Wistar and Gunn rats was faster than that to the corresponding control (KC500-untreated) rats. The accumulated level of [(125)I]T(4) was increased in several tissues, especially the liver, in the KC500-pretreated rats. The present findings demonstrated that a consecutive treatment with KC500 resulted in a significant decrease in the level of serum total T(4) in both Wistar and Gunn rats and further indicated that the KC500-induced decrease would occur through increase in accumulation of T(4) in several tissues, especially the liver, rather than increase in hepatic T(4)-UDP-GT activity.
18825156	The aim of this study was to reveal whether accumulation of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially polychlorinated biphenyl (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl, PCB 153), affects plasma levels of adiponectin in obese patients. The study was designed as a longitudinal intervention trial with a control group, where 27 obese women (body mass index (BMI)>30 kg/m(2); age 21-74 years) were studied before (OB) and after (OB-LCD) a 3-month low-calorie-diet intervention (LCD; 5 MJ daily). As the control group, 9 female volunteers without LCD intervention were used (C; BMI=19-25 kg/m(2); age 21-64 years). Plasma levels of PCB 153 were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection; total adiponectin and insulin plasma levels were quantified by immunoassays; and adiponectin multimeric complexes were quantified by immunoblotting. Plasma levels of total adiponectin, high and medium molecular weight multimers significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of PCB 153 in OB, but not in C or in OB-LCD, whereas the LCD intervention lowered BMI by 3.3+/-3.0 kg/m(2). Our results may suggest suppression of adiponectin by PCB 153 in obese women under non-energy-restrictive regime, which may contribute to the known association of PCB 153 and other POPs with type 2 diabetes.
22364893	A comprehensive worldwide literature review of blood levels of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in non-exposed adult general populations was performed. The studies published in 1989-2010 reporting information on polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho-PCBs (nPCBs), mono-ortho-PCBs (mPCBs) levels and Toxic Equivalencies (TEQs, a summary weighted measure of their combined toxicity) were reviewed. TEQs were calculated using as standard the most recent WHO 2005 reevaluation of Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs). Weighted multiple regression analyses adjusted for year, subject's age, type of sample analyzed, method used for values below detection limit, and central tendency measure used were performed for each congener and standardized TEQs (log-transformed). We identified 187 studies regarding 29,687 subjects of 26 countries. Year of blood collection ranged from 1985 to 2008. The studies reporting congener levels 161. In adjusted analyses, European countries showed higher levels of most dioxin-like congeners and TEQs. A strong positive association of subjects' age with most congeners and with TEQ values was found, confirming previous findings. Significant decreases over time (1985-2008) were documented for PCCDs, PCDFs, and TEQs including their contributions. No significant decrease was found for non-ortho-PCBs, notably PCB 126. Only some mono-ortho-PCBs showed clear significant declines. Accordingly, TEQs including only PCB contribution did not decrease over time. In interpreting these findings, it should be considered that for dioxin-like PCBs the analysis period was shorter (17 years), since these compounds were first measured in 1992.
18977572	We examined the accumulation of PCBs in ospreys (Pandion haleaetus) that were exposed to local sediment sources. Eggs, chick plasma, and sediment samples were collected over a range of 14 km (0.2-14.2 km) from a PCB source in Sturgeon Lake, ON. Sum PCB concentrations declined in chick plasma (range 422.5-58.3 ng/g) as distance from the PCB source increased, but there was a poor relationship with sum PCBs in eggs. Both tissues indicated an Aroclor 1248/1254 source. Aroclor 1254 comprised an average of 66.9% of sum PCBs in chick plasma from Sturgeon Lake, but comprised only from 27.0 to 44.4% in plasma from other Great Lake colonies. Dietary differences among osprey colonies were not sufficient to explain the PCB patterns observed. There was weak evidence that the ability to metabolize PCBs may differ between juveniles and adults, based upon the PCB profile in eggs and chick plasma.
20096358	We hypothesize that occupational exposure to PCBs is associated with a reduction in central dopamine (DA) similar to changes previously seen in PCB exposed adult non-human primates. To test that hypothesis, we used [(123)I]beta-CIT SPECT imaging to estimate basal ganglia DA transporter density in former capacitor workers. Women, but not men, showed an inverse relationship between lipid-adjusted total serum PCB concentrations and DA transporter densities in the absence of differences in serum PCB concentrations. These sex differences may reflect age-related reductions in the levels of gonadal hormones since these hormones have been shown experimentally to alter response to DA neurotoxicants. These findings may aid in better understanding the roles that sex and age play in modifying central DA function following exposure, not only to PCBs, but also to other DA neurotoxicants as well as further elucidating the role of gonadal hormones in influencing the initiation and/or progression of neurodegenerative disorders.
11097233	To assess a possible etiological role of organochlorine compounds in breast cancer development on Long Island, a high-risk region of New York State, concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in the adipose tissue of 232 women with breast cancer and 323 hospital controls admitted to surgery for benign breast disease or non-breast-related conditions. Seven pesticide residues and 14 PCB congeners were assayed via a supercritical fluid extraction method followed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. After adjustment for age and body mass index, which were strongly correlated with organochlorine levels, adipose concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene, total pesticides, and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) did not differ significantly between cases and controls. The relative abundance of individual pesticide species and PCB congeners was similar in cases and controls. Odds ratios adjusted for age, BMI, hospital, and race gave no evidence of a dose-response for 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene, total pesticides, or total PCBs, whether stratified by estrogen receptor status or not. Breast cancer risk among Long Island residents was not elevated compared with residents of the adjacent New York City borough of Queens. We did not confirm a previously reported association between breast cancer risk and levels of PCB congener 118 (2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), nor did we observe an association with the most abundant congener 153 (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl), a strong inducer of phase I enzymes that was reported recently to have estrogenic properties. Only PCB congener 183 (2,2',3,4,4',5',6-heptachlorobiphenyl), which is also an inducer, was significantly associated with risk, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.4) in women with adipose levels >5.67 ng/g; the biological importance of this observation is unclear without confirmation in additional studies. Although neither the present nor other studies have provided convincing evidence of an association between body burden of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane and PCBs with cancer of the breast, these compounds are rated as "possible" and "probable" human carcinogens, respectively, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Investigations of associations with cancer at other sites should be carried out.
16969666	Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed for the in vitro potencies to downregulate gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and PCB quinines using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Quantum chemical descriptors computed by the semiempirical AM1, PM3 and MNDO methods were used as predictor variables. The cross-validated Q2cum values for the three optimal QSAR models are 0.784, 0.789 and 0.755, respectively, indicating good predictive capabilities for the acute inhibition of GJIC (IC(50)) of oxygenated PCB derivatives. The slightly higher Q2cum value of the model using computed molecular descriptors from the PM3 Hamiltonian suggested a slightly better predictive power than the models developed using AM1 or MNDO. However, given these dispersion parameters in these three optimal models, there would not be a significant difference between the Q2cum values. Results from this study showed that the logarithmic scale of IC(50) is affected by different molecular structural descriptors.
19683226	Several human studies have shown that low-level exposure to environmental contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides, negatively influences birth outcomes. However, the effects of low-level exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) on birth outcomes have not been clarified in human studies. A prospective cohort study was established to investigate the possible adverse effects of PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs on fetal growth and neurodevelopment. We recruited 514 pregnant women between July 2002 and October 2005 in Sapporo, Japan. We measured 29 congener levels of PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs in maternal blood. Using multiple liner regression analysis of the association between birth weight and the levels of PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs with full adjustments for potential confounders, a significant adverse effect was observed regarding total PCDDs toxic equivalents (TEQ) levels (adjusted beta=-231.5g, 95% CI: -417.4 to -45.6) and total PCDFs TEQ levels (adjusted beta=-258.8g, 95% CI: -445.7 to -71.8). Among male infants, significant adverse associations with birth weight were found for total PCDDs TEQ level, total PCDDs/PCDFs TEQ level, and total TEQ level. However, among female infants, these significant adverse associations were not found. With regard to individual congeners of PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs, we found significantly negative association with the levels of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF (adjusted beta=-24.5g, 95% CI: -387.4 to -61.5). Our findings suggest that prenatal low-level exposure to PCDDs and PCDFs, especially 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, may accumulate in the placenta and retard important placental functions, which result in lower birth weight.
6402483	A method is proposed for concurrently determining the levels of multiple intact exogenous compounds in serum, particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as Aroclor (AR) 1254 and chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHs). Bovine serum pools containing in vivo-bound PCBs (as AR 1254) and in vitro-spiked CHs are used to evaluate the method, which encompasses serum denaturation with methanol, mixed solvent extraction, multiple solvent fractionation from activated silica gel, and determination by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography. Mean recoveries of the in vitro-spiked 9 CHs at levels of 2.0-29.1 ppb ranged from 52.8 to 98.4% from trial environmental pools; mean recoveries of the in vivo-bound PCBs (as AR 1254) were 114.1 and 92.6% at levels of 10 and 50 ppb, respectively.
10023801	Behavioral impairment as a consequence of PCB exposure beginning in utero has been reported in both humans and animals. The present study assessed the behavioral consequences of postnatal exposure to PCBs. Male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were dosed from birth to 20 weeks of age with 7.5 microg/kg/day of a PCB mixture representative of the PCBs typically found in human breast milk (eight monkeys) or vehicle (four monkeys). Blood PCB levels at 20 weeks of age were 0.30-0.37 ppb for control and 1.84-2.84 ppb for treated monkeys, and fat levels were 50-198 and 1694-3560 ppb for the two groups, respectively. Beginning at about 5.0 years of age, monkeys performed under concurrent schedules of reinforcement in which separate random intervals were in effect on two buttons independently. After steady-state performance was reached, the relative reinforcement ratio on the buttons was changed a total of four times, and performance both during transition and steady state was examined. There was no evidence for treatment-related differences in performance across the series of changes in schedule contingencies. The negative results failed to support the hypothesis that performance on an intermittent schedule, combined with the requirement for shifting response strategy, would prove particularly sensitive to postnatal PCB exposure. Following the concurrent schedules, monkeys were tested under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule preceded by a training procedure consisting of a within-session series of increasing fixed ratios. PCB-treated monkeys emitted more responses than controls over the first few sessions of the PR, which may be indicative of retarded acquisition of their steady-state PR performance. These results extend previous studies in these monkeys on the characterization of PCB-induced behavioral deficits.
16765350	PCB 77 is a dioxin-like PCB that has been shown to reduce circulating thyroid hormone (TH) levels. This may be an important factor contributing to its neurotoxicity, since THs are essential for normal brain development. In this study, we investigated the changes in TH activating and inactivating iodothyronine deiodinase (D) activities in liver, telencephalon and cerebellum of chicken embryos during the final stages of embryonic development and hatching. We combined these results with measurements of plasma TH levels and intracellular TH availability in the tissues mentioned above, to find out whether D activity was a factor contributing to the PCB 77-induced decrease in peripheral TH levels and/or whether it was capable of reducing the adverse effects on brain via compensatory mechanisms. PCB 77 reduced both T(4) and T(3) levels in plasma and brain. Its effect on hepatic D1 and D3 activity was limited and rebuts a causative role of hepatic Ds in the drop of plasma TH levels. In cerebellum, D2 increased and D3 decreased, indicating a compensatory mechanism in this brain part, mainly during the stages of pipping and hatching. The changes in telencephalon occurred at the earlier stages and included an increase in both D2 and D3 activity.
12694628	BACKGROUND: Fish from the Great Lakes are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been found to have several adverse reproductive effects. Several environmental contaminants have been found to alter the sex ratio of offspring at birth, but the evidence of such an effect of polychlorinated biphenyls has been inconsistent. METHODS: We examined parental serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentration in relation to the sex ratio of 173 children of mothers and 208 children of fathers from the Great Lakes region of the United States between 1970 and 1995. We calculated odds ratios for a male child using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations with adjustment for the year of birth of the child, maternal and paternal age, the mother's parity at the child's birth, and whether the child had an older brother. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for having a male child among mothers in the highest quintile of serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentration was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.06-0.59) compared to mothers in the lowest quintile. Treating exposure as a continuous variable, the adjusted odds ratio for having a male child was 0.54 per unit increase in the natural log of maternal serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentration (95% CI: 0.33-0.89). There was little evidence of an association with paternal exposure. We found no association between either maternal or paternal serum dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethene concentration and the sex ratio. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that maternal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls may decrease the sex ratio of offspring. These data add to the growing body of evidence that exposure to particular chemicals can alter the sex ratio at birth. 
812580	PCB levels were determined with maternal and cord blood sampled at the time of delivery. All of the twentyfour mothers selected for this experiment are residents to Tokyo Metropolitan area. Gaschromatographic patterns of PCBs in cord blood closely resembled those of mothers. The cord blood in general showed lower PCB levels on both whole and fat basis than those in the maternal blood. No correlation was noticeable on statistical basis as regards the concentrations of PCBs between the cord blood and maternal blood. Our data suggests that the passage of PCBs through the placenta follows general patterns observed in other organochlorine insecticides.
9828305	Yusho blood and control serum were collected in around 1991 and analyzed for congeners of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs. In Yusho blood, TEQ was mainly contributed by 2,3,4,7,8-penta-CDF (77-248 ppt), 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexa-CDF (15-37 ppt) and 2,3,3',4,4',5-hexa-CB (16-77 ppt). Total TEQ in Yusho blood (185-441 ppt) was only 3-14 times higher than that of control serum (31-61 ppt). It is notable that the concentrations of 3,3',4,4',5-, 2,3,3',4,4'- and 2,3',4,4',5-penta-CBs in Yusho blood were comparable to or lower up to 3-5 times than those in control blood.
23336921	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are carcinogenic. Estimating PCB half-life in the body based on levels in sera from exposed workers is complicated by the fact that occupational exposure to PCBs was to commercial PCB products (such as Aroclors 1242 and 1254) comprised of varying mixtures of PCB congeners. Half-lives were estimated using sera donated by 191 capacitor manufacturing plant workers in 1976 during PCB use (1946-1977), and post-exposure (1979, 1983, and 1988). Our aims were to: (1) determine the role of covariates such as gender on the half-life estimates, and (2) compare our results with other published half-life estimates based on exposed workers. All serum PCB levels were adjusted for PCB background levels. A linear spline model with a single knot was used to estimate two separate linear equations for the first two serum draws (Equation A) and the latter two (Equation B). Equation A gave half-life estimates of 1.74 years and 6.01 years for Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1254, respectively. Estimates were 21.83 years for Aroclor 1242 and 133.33 years for Aroclor 1254 using Equation B. High initial body burden was associated with rapid PCB elimination in workers at or shortly after the time they were occupationally exposed and slowed down considerably when the dose reached background PCB levels. These concentration-dependent half-life estimates had a transition point of 138.57 and 34.78 ppb for Aroclor 1242 and 1254, respectively. This result will help in understanding the toxicological and epidemiological impact of exposure to PCBs in humans.
16244432	To assess levels of dioxin background contamination and transfer of dioxins from mothers to unborn children and infants, concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and coplanar-polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCBs) were measured in human samples from expectant and nursing mothers living in Nara, Japan. The average toxic equivalency quantities (TEQs) of PCDDs/PCDFs and Co-PCBs from circulating maternal blood, cord blood, placenta, milk taken 3-10 d after delivery, milk taken one month after delivery, and adipose tissue were 26 and 9.3, 15 and 2.3, 31 and 1.2, 16 and 5.4, 18 and 8.8, and 16 and 7.7 pg-TEQ/g-fat, respectively. Among the various PCDD/PCDF congeners, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF contributed most heavily to the TEQs of all maternal samples. Among the various Co-PCB congeners, 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB (#126), 2,3,3',4,4',5-HxCB (#156), and 2,3',4,4',5-PeCB (#118) contributed most heavily to the TEQs of all maternal samples. But, the concentrations and relative percentages of congeners differed among the various samples, suggesting that congeners showing high toxic equivalency factor accumulate in the placenta.
15516123	A new method using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and isotope dilution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-IDTOFMS) for the simultaneous measurement of selected polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and brominated flame retardants is presented. In contrast to the reference methods based on classical GC/MS, a single injection of the extract containing all compounds of interest results in accurate identification and quantification. Using GCxGC ensures the chromatographic separation of most compounds, and TOFMS allows mass spectral deconvolution of coeluting compounds as well as the use of (13)C-labeled internal standards for quantification. Isotope ratio measurements of the most intense ions for both native and labels ensure the required specificity. The use of this new method with an automated sample preparation procedure developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the analysis of human serum and milk compared favorably to conventional isotope-dilution one-dimensional gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-IDHRMS) for the different human serum and milk pools tested. The instrumental detection limits ranged between 0.5 pg/microL and 10 pg/microL and the method detection limits ranged between 1 and 15 pg/microL (N = 59 analytes). The reproducibility of the method was almost as good as with GC-IDHRMS, the relative standard deviations ranging between 1 and 11% for OCPs measured in human serum. OCP, PBDE, and PCB levels measured using the two methods were highly correlated, and the deviations between the two methods were below 20% for most analytes with concentrations above 1 ng/g milk lipids.
19815845	Hypothyroxinemia in rats has been well documented as a result of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Hypothetical mechanisms include induction of hepatic catabolic enzymes and cellular hormone transporters, and/or interference with plasma transport proteins. We hypothesized that if thyroxine displacement from transport proteins by PCBs occurs in vivo, it would result in increased free thyroxine (FT4). This study investigates the effects of a single oral dose of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153 at 60 mg/kg) or 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 169 at 1 mg/kg) on rats at 28 or 76 days of age. Total thyroxine (TT4) and FT4 were measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, or 48 hours post-dosing. Microsomal ethoxy- and pentoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase (EROD and PROD) activity and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) activity were determined. No significant increase in TT4 or FT4 concentrations was seen at any time point. PCB 153 significantly decreased TT4 and FT4 in young and adult rats, with young rats showing a time-by-treatment interaction from 2 to 48 hours post-dosing in serum FT4. With PCB 169 exposure, young rats showed a decrease in FT4 only, whereas adult rats showed decreases in TT4 only. Hepatic EROD and PROD activities were both dramatically increased following PCB 169 and 153, respectively. Uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase activity was increased only after PCB 169 exposure. These data demonstrate that neither PCB 153 nor PCB169 increased FT4, which supports the conclusion that these PCBs do not displace thyroxine from serum TTR, or if it does occur, there is no subsequent increase in serum FT4 in vivo.
14963712	Yucheng ("oil-disease") victims were Taiwanese people exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their heat-degradation products, mainly polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), from the ingestion of contaminated rice oil in 1978-1979. Serial studies in Yucheng offspring born between 1978 and 1992 are summarized. Children of the exposed women were born with retarded growth, with dysmorphic physical findings, and, during development, with delayed cognitive development, increased otitis media, and more behavioral problems than unexposed children. Recently, examination of the reproductive system has suggested that prenatal exposure exerts late effects on semen parameters in young men after puberty. Results of the investigation in Yucheng children will provide important information about the human health effects and toxicology of PCB/PCDF exposure. Prenatal exposure to these environmental chemicals causes the fetus to be sensitive to the toxic effects of persistent organic pollutants.
21186023	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) may affect the female reproductive system in humans. A mass poisoning occurred in Taiwan due to PCBs/PCDFs-contaminated cooking oil, and was called the Yucheng (oil-disease in Chinese). We aimed to determine whether Yucheng women were affected in their menstruation. METHODS: After the event, we followed the exposed individuals and an age-matched neighborhood reference group. Menstrual cycle characteristics and age at menarche were obtained by a telephone interview. We used multiple linear and logistic regression to examine the association between PCBs/PCDFs and menstrual cycle characteristics, after adjusting for confounding factors. RESULTS: Totally 445 women responded satisfactorily and were included in the analyses of menstrual characteristics. Menstrual cycle irregularity and dysmenorrheal did not differ between Yucheng and referents. Yucheng women's menstrual cycles were 0.5 (95% CI: 0.0-0.5; p=0.03) days shorter than those of the referents. The Yucheng women with skin lesions caused by PCBs/PCDFs were more prominently affected, with the cycles 1.2 days shorter than the referents. Yucheng women exposed to PCBs/PCDFs at the premenacheal period had reduced cycle length (-0.7 day, 95% CI: -1.4 to 0.0; p=0.04) and longer days of menstrual flow (0.5 day, 95% CI: 0.0-1.0; p=0.04). Among those women who were exposed at an age of 5-9 years, menarche started slightly earlier with borderline significance. CONCLUSIONS: Shorter menstrual cycle length and a longer duration of bleeding in each cycle were found among women previously exposed to PCBs/PCDFs. These effects were more obviously observed among those exposed at premenarcheal ages. 
12690495	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate background exposure levels and determinants of the individual variations in the exposure to dioxins in Japan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 131 men and 122 women (aged 20-76 years), who resided in five prefectures of Japan and had no occupational exposure to dioxins. Seven polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), ten polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs) and 12 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are assigned a toxicity equivalent factor, were determined in fasting blood. Biochemical analysis of plasma and a questionnaire survey on life-style, including dietary habit, were also performed. Factors associated with the levels of dioxin-related compounds in blood were evaluated by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The median of total toxicity equivalents (TEQs) in men and women was 17 and 16 pg TEQ/g lipid, respectively, with no gender difference. After adjustment for age and other covariates, plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid, a biomarker of fish intake, were found to be positively associated with blood levels of total dioxin, PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs, all of which were expressed on a TEQ basis (P<0.01). The frequency of intake of coastal fish, such as horse mackerel, mackerel and sardine, was also associated with TEQ-based concentrations of PCDFs (P=0.03) and PCBs (P=0.08). The intake of raw fish was positively related to total dioxins (P=0.06) and PCBs (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The level of intake of marine fish, especially raw fish and coastal varieties, may be associated with increased blood levels of dioxin-related compounds among the population. Despite high fish consumption in Japan, the body burden of dioxins in the population was not found to be higher than that in western countries. 
19027927	Endometriosis among women of reproductive age can result in pain and infertility. The objectives of this study were to test if there is a relation between endometriosis and serum dioxin concentrations as expressed by total toxic equivalence and serum total polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations among women patients at one Atlanta reproductive medicine clinic during 1998-1999; a secondary objective was to provide exposure data for individual congeners of these chemicals and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDE) in women in Atlanta. Laparoscopy including biopsy and visualization of the peritoneal cavity, ovaries, outside of the fallopian tubes and uterus confirmed all endometriosis cases (n=60) and confirmed 30 controls without endometriosis. Other controls had an infertile partner (n=27) or ovulation problems (n=7) with no signs or symptoms of endometriosis. All serum samples were analyzed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2003. Statistical analyses included Fisher's exact chi-square tests and logistic regression. Models were presented for the full study sample and for the subset that included all cases (n=60) and only controls (n=30) with surgical confirmation of disease-free status. Serum concentrations (lipid-adjusted and non lipid-adjusted) of analyzed exposure measures were low and similar for cases and controls and did not explain endometriosis in the study population.
16242275	The main goal of this study is to establish the reference values of individual Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in non-occupationally exposed subjects. Since the PCB pattern in human serum is related to the living area, two different population groups from North and Central Italy, were compared. Serum concentrations of both coplanar and non-coplanar PCB congeners were measured by using gas chromatography coupled with low-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-LRMS). A fast and reliable method for the determination of 60 congeners had been previously validated. Its reliability was further verified by using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Thirty-one congeners out of 60 were found at detectable concentrations in at least one sample. The mean value for total PCBs was found to be 2.48 and 3.93 microg/L for the two population groups. Eight dioxin-like PCBs were detected. In accordance with the findings from the literature, the most abundant congeners were found to be 153, 138, 180, and 170. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that age is a significant determinant of PCB concentrations. The correlation increased with increasing chlorination. Slight differences in the PCB pattern were observed in the two population groups.
12691726	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental chemicals that accumulate at the apex of food chains. Several scientific committees support its designation as a human carcinogen, even though the precise mechanism of carcinogenesis remains controversial. In view of its uncertain ability to cause DNA damage in human liver, we investigated the effects of Aroclor 1254, Aroclor 1016, and 4-chlorobiphenyl (4-CB) on DNA adduct formation in cultures of primary human hepatocytes from five donors. Based on (32)P-postlabeling assays, we detected DNA adducts in native human liver as well as untreated, i.e., control cultures of human hepatocytes. Treatment of human hepatocytes with Aroclor 1016 and Aroclor 1254 resulted in four-fold (NP1) and seven-fold (butanol) increases in DNA adduct formation. Further, two and six new adduct spots were detected by multidirectional thin-layer chromatography after nuclease P1 and butanol enrichment. Treatment of human hepatocyte cultures with 4-CB led to 209 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides at the 60 microM concentration, and we show metabolically activated PCBs to be more efficient in the production of DNA-binding species compared with higher chlorinated PCB mixtures. Our study is therefore highly suggestive for a link between PCB exposure and DNA insult in human hepatocytes.
17509640	The objective of this study was to evaluate all congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum samples. Concentrations of all PCB congeners in the serum of 87 volunteers were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The participants consisted of 47 males and 40 females, including 25 men working at municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs). The mean concentrations of total PCBs and dioxin-like PCBs were 242.77ng/g lipid (median: 180.17ng/g lipid) and 18.57ng/g lipid (median: 15.34ng/g lipid), respectively. Penta-, hexa-, and heptachlorinated biphenyls contributed more than 80% of the total PCBs detected in human serum. Congener-specific analysis indicated that PCB153, PCB138, PCB180, PCB187, and PCB118 contributed 57.3% of the total PCBs detected in human serum samples. A statistical analysis was performed to determine whether there were significant correlations between PCB concentrations and specific variables such as age, gender, smoking habits, occupation, and body mass index (BMI). However, serum PCB concentrations correlated only with age. In addition, we found that total PCBs and dioxin-like PCBs highly correlated with PCB153 (correlation coefficient r=0.93, p<0.01) and PCB118 (correlation coefficient r=0.98, p<0.01), respectively. Thus these two congeners could be satisfactory indicators for total PCBs and dioxin-like PCBs in human serum.
19330584	Experimental evidence suggests that monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) are involved in the pathogenesis of neurotoxicity caused by methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Blood samples from 7-year-old exposed children were analyzed for platelet MAO-B and lymphocyte mAChRs as potential markers of exposure to these neurotoxicants. The blood neurotoxicity biomarkers were compared with prenatal and current exposures and with neuropsychological test results. Both biomarkers showed homogeneous distributions within this cohort (mAChR, range 0.04-36.78 fmol/million cells; MAO-B, 0.95-14.95 nmol mg(-1) protein h(-1)). No correlation was found between the two biomarkers and either blood neurotoxicant concentrations or clinical findings. MAO-B and mAChR sensitivity may not be sufficiently high to assess early, subclinical responses to low/moderate methylmercury and/or PCB exposure, whereas these markers are significantly altered in sustained exposure scenarios, as shown by clinical studies in drug addicts or patients treated with psychopharmacological agents.
21696632	BACKGROUND: The present study assessed the temporal trend in serum concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and biphenyls (PCBs) among residents of a Russian town where levels of these chemicals are elevated due to prior industrial activity. METHODS: Two serum samples were collected from eight adult women (in 2000 and 2009), and analyzed with gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The average total toxic equivalency (TEQ) decreased by 30% (from 36 to 25 pg/g lipid), and the average sum of PCB congeners decreased by 19% (from 291 to 211 ng/g lipid). Total TEQs decreased for seven of the eight women, and the sum of PCBs decreased for six of eight women. During this nine year period, larger decreases in serum TEQs and PCBs were found in women with greater increases in body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides suggestive evidence that average serum concentrations of dioxins, furans, and PCBs are decreasing over time among residents of this town. 
21616713	In the past, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been widely used and were distributed in the environment. Due to their high persistence and bioaccumulative potential, they can still be detected in the blood of the general population, despite their ban more than 20 years ago. Among the various congeners, the presence of dioxin-like PCBs in blood raises the highest environmental concerns due to their critical toxicological properties. We determined the plasma concentrations of 6 non-dioxin-like and 12 dioxin-like PCBs as well as the organochlorine pesticides HCB and p,p'-DDE (p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) in a group of 105 non-smokers out of the German general population by GC/MS as an estimate of the background burden to these compounds. The organochlorine compounds were extracted from plasma with n-hexane, cleaned up on a silica gel column and finally quantified using GC/MS and (13)C(12)-labelled internal standards. The limit of detection for all congeners was determined to be 0.01 μg/Lplasma. Age had a strong influence on the plasma levels of HCB (hexachlorobenzene), p,p'-DDE and all higher chlorinated PCB congeners, while no gender difference was observed. Among the dioxin-like PCBs, PCB 118, PCB 156 and PCB 167 were detectable in 74-98% of all samples. Highly significant correlations between several PCB-congeners were observed. Our results provide for the first time volume-based data on the extent of the age-related background burden to dioxin-like PCBs in Germany.
15371227	Contaminant-induced immunosuppression by organochlorines (OC), particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), has been suspected as a cofactor in the deaths of thousands of marine mammals. One important innate defense mechanism is phagocytosis, the ability of cells to ingest extracellular macromolecules. The present study was aimed at characterizing the immunomodulatory potential of representative OCs on phagocytosis in bottlenose dolphins and beluga whales. The ability of peripheral blood leukocytes to engulf fluorescent microspheres was evaluated using flow cytometry. The immunomodulatory effects of three non-coplanar PCB congeners, 138, 153, and 180, one coplanar PCB, 169, and 2,3,7,8-TCDD and all possible mixtures (26) were tested upon in vitro exposure. In both species, all mixtures containing at least two non-coplanar PCBs significantly reduced both neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis, with effects more marked in dolphins than in belugas. Coplanar OCs, on their own or when added to non-coplanar congeners, did not further modulate phagocytosis, suggesting an Ah receptor-independent mechanism. Concentration-response experiments with individual congeners further demonstrated a non-coplanar PCB-induced suppression of phagocytosis, while coplanar congeners produced no consistent effects. Our results suggest simple additive interactions of chemicals in a mixture. However, calculation of toxic equivalency (TEQs) failed to predict the experimentally induced immunomodulatory effects of OCs on dolphin and beluga phagocytosis, confirming the Ah receptor-independent nature of the effects on phagocytosis. Overall, our results suggest that non-AhR mechanisms may explain one facet of immunotoxicity (phagocytosis), something that is not captured using the TEQ approach. This is the first report demonstrating the immunomodulatory effects of OCs on dolphin and beluga phagocytosis, and the first overall demonstration of immunomodulatory effects on phagocytosis mediated specifically by non-coplanar PCBs.
22189045	BACKGROUND: Chromosomal abnormalities contribute substantially to reproductive problems, but the role of environmental risk factors has received little attention. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) exposures with sperm sex-chromosome disomy. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 192 men from subfertile couples. We used multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 to determine XX, YY, XY, and total sex-chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Serum was analyzed for concentrations of 57 PCB congeners and p,p'-DDE. Poisson regression models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for disomy by exposure quartiles, controlling for demographic characteristics and semen parameters. RESULTS: The median percent disomy was 0.3 for XX and YY, 0.9 for XY, and 1.6 for total sex-chromosome disomy. We observed a significant trend of increasing IRRs for increasing quartiles of p,p'-DDE in XX, XY, and total sex-chromosome disomy, and a significant trend of increasing IRRs for increasing quartiles of PCBs for XY and total sex-chromosome disomy; however, there was a significant inverse association for XX disomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exposure to p,p'-DDE may be associated with increased rates of XX, XY, and total sex-chromosome disomy, whereas exposure to PCBs may be associated with increased rates of YY, XY, and total sex-chromosome disomy. In addition, we observed an inverse association between increased exposure to PCBs and XX disomy. Further work is needed to confirm these findings. 
19070886	We conducted a congener-specific analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in blood collected from 242 Yusho patients (mean: 65.5 years, median: 67.0 years) and 74 Yusho-suspected persons (mean: 54.7 years, median: 55.0 years) in 2004, and compared each congener concentrations of PCBs among the groups of Yusho patients, Yusho-suspected persons, and normal controls (mean: 68.1 years, median: 67.0 years) with the concentrations previously reported. Among the 209 PCB congeners, 8 congeners of mono-ortho PCBs and 56 congeners of non-dioxin-like PCBs were identified in the blood of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons. Among the PCB congeners measured in the present study, hexaCB-153, hexaCB-138, heptaCB-180, and heptaCB-182/heptaCB-187 showed high ratios to total concentrations of 64 PCB congeners detected in the blood of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons, and the congener profiles were the same as those obtained in normal controls. The sums of the concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons were 40-3032 (mean: 645, median: 536) and 20-1418 (mean: 355, median: 317) ng g(-1) lipid, respectively, and the concentrations were 50% higher and 20% lower than those of normal controls, respectively. The relative contribution ratios of the concentrations of the triCBs, tetraCBs, and pentaCBs to the total concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients were slightly lower than those of Yusho-suspected persons and normal controls, and the ratios of nonaCBs and decaCB-209 concentrations were nearly the same among the Yusho patients, Yusho-suspected persons, and normal controls. However, the ratios of the concentrations of hexaCBs, heptaCBs, and octaCBs to the total concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood of Yusho patients tended to be slightly higher compared to those of the Yusho-suspected persons and normal controls. From the results comparing the concentrations of 64 PCB congeners in the blood between Yusho patients and normal controls, the concentrations of hexaCB-156, hexaCB-157, heptaCB-181, and heptaCB-189 of the Yusho patients were 3.4, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.8 times higher than those of the normal controls, respectively, indicating that even now, 35 years after exposure, Yusho patients still have a higher concentration of hexaCB-156, hexaCB-157, heptaCB-181, and heptaCB-189 in their blood than do unaffected people. These four congeners may be considered the most important congeners for evaluating the PCBs toxicity of Yusho patients.
9200862	The milk samples were collected from mothers who had lived in the area for at least 5 years, healthy and breast feeding their first, second or third child. Of the 175 mothers' milk samples analysed, the organochlorine pesticide residues were detected in the following order of frequency: pp-DDE, 100%, pp-DDT 98%; and sum PCB, 53%. Of all the seven areas analysed the Kariba area and the highest mean level of sum DDT--25,259 ng/g milk fat and the lowest mean level of sum DDT of 1607 ng/G milk fat was found in Esigodini which is a rural area. The major DDT metabolite was pp-DDE. The ratio of pp-DDT/pp-DDE was highest in Kariba (0.6) suggesting recent pollution by DDT in that area. The results show that the vector control programmes (extensive pesticide spraying of disease-carrying pests, such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies), agricultural activities and dietary habits were the main contributing factors towards the high levels of pesticides in most of the areas. Kadoma area had the highest mean level of sum-PCB (60 ng/g milk fat).
12389902	A method for analysis of hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) was developed and adopted to the previously described method for determination of PCBs and methylsulfonyl-PCBs (MeSO2-PCBs) in human liver and adipose tissue. The concentrations of OH-PCBs (14 congeners), MeSO2-PCBs (24 congeners), and PCBs (17 congeners) in five paired samples of human liver and adipose tissue are reported. The sum of OH-PCB congeners was higher in liver (7-175 ng/g lipids) than in adipose tissue (0.3-9 ng/g lipids). In both liver and adipose tissue, 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexachloro-3'-biphenylol (3'-OH-CB138) and 2,2',3,3',4,5'-hexachloro-4'-biphenylol (4'-OH-CB130) were the predominant hydroxylated PCB metabolites. The sum of OH-PCB congeners were of the same order of magnitude as those of methylsulfonyl metabolites of PCB in the same samples, 12 to 358 ng/g lipids and 2 to 9 ng/g lipids in liver and adipose tissue, respectively. The levels of PCBs were similar in liver and adipose tissue, 459 to 2,085 ng/g lipids and 561 to 2,343 ng/g lipids, respectively. The sum of OH-PCBs and the sum of MeSO2-PCBs correlated to the sum of PCBs. The determined PCB metabolites constituted 3 to 26% of total PCB concentration in the liver and 0.3 to 0.8% of total PCBs in the adipose tissue samples.
12434227	Blood serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in members of a residential community who lived near a chemical plant that formerly manufactured PCBs. Elevated blood serum PCB concentrations were detected in some of the older adults who were long-term residents of the community. Congener-specific analyses indicated that PCB congeners 153, 138/158, 180, 118, and 187 contributed 60-67% of the total PCBs detected in blood from adults and children. Blood PCB concentrations correlated strongly with age and length of residency in the neighborhood. However, blood PCB concentrations did not correlate with PCB concentrations in soil or house dust samples from the homes. Past exposures to PCBs may be a significant contributor to the elevated PCB concentrations detected in some adult members of the community.
11372890	This study characterizes the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners PCB 77, PCB 81, PCB 126, and PCB 169, in a group of 150 men and women with no documented exposure to PCBs. Its purpose is to provide current referent levels of coplanar PCBs in Missouri residents and to compare those levels to levels reported in the literature from the United States and other countries. Although this study used an extensive questionnaire assessing potential sources of exposure, no positive relations were found between these exposure sources and participants' PCB levels. The PCB levels for the four congeners measured were lower than any reported in the literature. PCBs 126 and 169 are only two of the dioxin-like congeners; however, their contribution makes up 11% of the total TEQ. Age was significantly related to PCB 126 and PCB 169. For every one-year increase in age, both PCB congeners increased by approximately 0.4 parts per trillion (ppt). There was no gender difference for PCB 126; however, PCB 169 levels were 3 ppt higher in males than females.
15981037	Four groups of 16 age-matched female Crl:SKH1-hrBR hairless mice were exposed to either control soil or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated soil (retrieved from an electrical waste landfill in Southern Illinois) for 11 weeks. The mice were exposed in a study to determine interactions between environmental PCBs and ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but the UVR group did not differ and provided a replicate for the residue study. Ear biopsies were performed immediately after the termination of soil exposure. The mice were maintained in regular bedding for 37 weeks thereafter. The ear-skin, trunk-skin, fat-pad, and liver samples were collected and weighed at the end of the study (week 48) and analyzed for PCB residues. A total of 141 PCB congeners were target analytes. There were significant differences in body weights and food consumption from week 2 to 28. The liver weights of mice treated with PCB only were significantly greater than those of UVR-treated mice. The fat-pad weight did not differ among treated groups. PCB residues in the ear biopsies specimens of mice exposed to contaminated soil were 342.3 and 317.2 ppm in the PCB- and PCB + UVR-treated groups, respectively, and contained both persistent and episodic congeners. After 37 weeks of isolation from soil, the ear PCB residues decreased to 21.5 ppm (PCB group) and 14.5 ppm (PCB + UVR group), and only persistent congeners contributed to the total PCB residues. The accumulation of PCB residues was highest in the fat pad (fat pad > ear skin > trunk skin > liver) in both PCB +/- UVR groups at the end of the study. However, the percentage of individual congeners contributing to total PCBs in these different tissues did not differ.
17683999	This study examines a novel sample preparation method for the determination of 11 hydroxy metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in plasma and organ tissues, followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The clean-up method was optimized to eliminate the interference matter by using a silica column and 10 mL of n-hexane/dichloromethane (4:6, v/v) as an eluent. Solid-phase and solvent extraction procedures were used for the plasma and tissues samples, respectively. Compared to C(18) and C(8) solid-phase, C(2) showed higher extraction efficiency with n-hexane as the eluent for plasma. The hydroxy-PCB extraction recoveries achieved with this combined extraction and clean-up procedure from plasma ranged from 87 to 117%, while those from tissues ranged from 82 to 111%. The linear detector responses for propyl derivatives of hydroxy-PCBs were obtained with the coefficients of determination varying from 0.992 to 0.998 in the concentration range of 0.1-20 ng mL(-1). The method detection limits ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 ng mL(-1) in 1 mL of plasma and from 0.1 to 0.5 ng g(-1) in 1g of tissues. This procedure was successfully applied to the study of 3-OH-2,3',4,4',5-PeCB in rat plasma and liver samples after intraperitoneal injection (20 mg/kg) of 2,3',4,4',5-PeCB.
23452794	A sensitive method based on programmable temperature vaporization large volume injection coupled to gas chromatogram and high-resolution mass spectrometry (PTV-GC-HRMS) has been developed for the determination of ultra trace levels of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL PCBs) in small amounts of human blood. Blood samples (1mL) were first extracted by column extraction and then purified with column chromatorgraphies. Final extracts (20μL) were introduced to the PTV injector under the solvent vent mode and detected by GC-HRMS (SIM mode). PTV parameters were observed by changing one factor at a time (practical conditions: vent flow: 50mLmin(-1), vent pressure: 0kPa and vent time: 0.1min), recoveries of most PCB congeners ranged from 55.1% to 108%, and method detection limits were in the range of 0.11-1.63pgg(-1).
17217986	Blood samples of pregnant women aged between 19 and 42 years at the time they gave birth and milk samples from the same women following delivery were collected between September 2000 and January 2003 from 169 participants living in an industrialized area of Germany (Duisburg birth cohort study). All samples were analyzed for their content of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) as well as dioxin-like and indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Levels of WHO-TEq were in the range of 4.34-97.3 pg/g(lipid base) (median: 26.37, arithmetic mean: 28.36) for blood, or 3.01-78.7 pg/g(lipid base) (median: 26.40, arithmetic mean: 27.27) for milk, respectively. The four congeners 12378-PeCDD, 23478-PeCDF, 33'44'5-PeCB (# 126) and 233'44'5-HxCB (# 156) contribute the main share to total WHO-TEq. The contribution of PCDD/F in relation to PCB to total WHO-TEq was 60:40% in blood and 52:48% in milk. Good correlations of the contaminant levels in lipid base between both matrices were found. The distribution between blood and milk depends on the molecular weight of the substances. Higher chlorinated PCDD/F- and PCB-congeners were found in 2-4-fold higher concentrations in blood in relation to milk and the concentrations of lower chlorinated PCB-congeners were up to 2-fold higher in milk in relation to blood. The body burden of PCDD/F and PCB increases with age and decreases over the total nursing period. Women who had lived outside highly industrialized countries showed lower concentrations of PCDD/F and PCB. In some cases, elevated levels of PCB were observed when the women had previously lived in Eastern Europe for a long time. In comparison with recent data, the decline in human PCDD/F and PCB levels observed during the nineties seems to have stopped. The individual exposures of the infants due to breastfeeding within the first 18 months were calculated to be from 4.4 to 318 ng WHO-TEq (median: 106, arithmetic mean: 118). The actual mean daily exposure of a breastfed infant can be estimated to 131 pg WHO-TEq/kg(body weight).
12039686	Effects of different fish-based diets (freshwater smelt, Baltic herring, marine herring/cod offal or their mixtures), gender, beta-glucan supplement, exogenous melatonin, and PCB exposure (Aroclor 1242((R)), 1 mg per animal per day in feed) on plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the mink (Mustela vison) were studied. The aims of the study were to find out whether plasma IgG of the mink is affected by the subchronic PCB exposure, and whether biological, nutritional and hormonal effects are large enough to mask the possible IgG response. The concentration of IgG was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sexual dimorphism was detected, the males having higher levels of plasma IgG. In addition, melatonin tended to decrease IgG in females but not males. Diet also affected the humoral immune arm; the mixed-fish diets caused an unfavorable ratio of the oxidation products of lipids vs. vitamin E in liver, and resulted in low IgG concentration in plasma. In males fed Baltic herring, the beta-glucan supplement also lowered IgG levels. The PCBs failed to affect the plasma IgG of the smelt-fed female mink, and IgG concentration was not correlated with increased hepatic EROD activity or with the decreased total retinol in the liver of exposed mink. It is concluded that hormonal/seasonal and dietary factors affect the plasma IgG levels to such an extent that possible change in plasma IgG level due to PCBs in wild populations of mink is difficult to detect without a large amount of reference data.
20132952	Exposure to contaminants other than petroleum hydrocarbons could confound interpretation of Exxon Valdez oil spill effects on biota at Prince William Sound, Alaska. Hence, we investigated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in blood of sea otters and harlequin ducks sampled during 1998. PCB concentrations characterized by lower chlorinated congeners were highest in sea otters from the unoiled area, whereas concentrations were similar among harlequin ducks from the oiled and unoiled area. Blood enzymes often elevated by xenobiotics were not related to PCB concentrations in sea otters. Only sea otters from the unoiled area had estimated risk from PCBs, and PCB composition or concentrations did not correspond to reported lower measures of population performance in sea otters or harlequin ducks from the oiled area. PCBs probably did not influence limited sea otter or harlequin duck recovery in the oiled area a decade after the spill.
9693840	Here we report a validated technique for quantifying up to 20 specific PCB congeners in 1-2 g samples of whole blood with a detection limit below 1 ng/g (ppb) wet weight. Specimens were analyzed from 14 harbor seals sampled in south San Francisco Bay, California during 1991-1992. Ratios of specific congeners to PCB-153, and other aspects of congener pattern, agreed with published values for PCB's detected in seal blood. PCB-153 constituted 30 percent of our sigma PCB values. The mean sigma PCB concentration for the San Francisco Bay seals was 50 ppb, about three times the average level reported for blood of captive seals fed exclusively on fish from the Baltic's PCB-contaminated Dutch Wadden Sea. Such experimental populations have exhibited depressed reproductive success and impaired immune function. These findings support concerns about the ecological effects of PCB contamination in San Francisco Bay.
12747519	The authors evaluated dietary predictors of concentrations of 11 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in breast adipose tissue from 190 women with benign breast disease who live in Ontario, Canada. Consumption of fish was positively correlated with, and the most consistent dietary predictor of, breast tissue PCB levels. Dietary predictors accounted for < 8% of the variation in breast adipose tissue PCB levels. Age was positively and most strongly associated with tissue PCB levels, perhaps representing long-term dietary intake and the complex interplay of absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion.
10856030	We assessed exposure to dioxin-like compounds using chemical and bioassay analysis in different matrices in a female population. A total of 106 serum and 9 follicular fluid samples were collected from infertile women attending Centers for Reproductive Medicine in Belgium from 1996 to 1998. Major polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were quantified by chemical analysis using gas chromatography with electron-capture detection, and the chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX) bioassay was used to determine the total dioxin-like toxic equivalence (TEQ) of mixtures of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons present in body fluids, such as serum and follicular fluid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to determine TEQ values by the CALUX bioassay in follicular fluid. The TEQ levels in both matrices are well correlated (r = 0.83, p = 0.02). As the chemical and bioassay analysis executed in this study do not cover the same span of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, we did not expect totally correlated results. Moreover, the sample workup and quantification of the analytes differed completely. Nonetheless, the TEQ values in human extracts correlated well with the sum of four major PCB congeners chemically determined in both serum and follicular fluid. These results indicate that the CALUX bioassay may serve as a simple, relatively inexpensive prescreening tool for exposure assessment in epidemiologic surveys.
6278153	The effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the development of several intestinal and serum marker enzymes have been studied. The three congeners 4-monochloro (1-CB), 3, 4, 3',4'-tetrachloro (4-CB), and 2, 4, 5, 2', 4, 5'-hexachloro (6-CB) biphenyl were administered orally to pregnant rats on d 8, 11, 13, 15, and 18 or gestation. 1-CB and 6-CB were intubated at doses of 30 mg/kg.d (total dose, 150, mg/kg) and 4-CB was administered at 3 mg/kg-d (total dose, 15 mg/kg). Levels of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, monoamine oxidase, and Na+, K+-adenosin-5'-etriphosphatase and levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were measured in the dams after weaning and in their offspring at -1, 6, 20, and 55 d of age. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity was elevated at the later postnatal stages in the 1-CB group and depressed at 55 d in the 4-CB group, whereas serum alkaline phosphatase levels were markedly depressed prenatally and postnatally in the 4-CB and 6-CB groups, respectively, Intestinal monoamine oxidase levels were markedly increased in the 6-CB group at -1, 6, and 20 d of age and significantly depressed in the 4-CB animals at -1 and 55 d of age. There was an increase in monoamine oxidase activity in the 4-CB group at 6 d. The 1-CB group exhibited depression of monoamine oxidase levels at 6 and elevation at 20 and 55 d. Intestinal Na+, K+-ATPase levels were elevated throughout development in the 1-CB animals and at -1 and 6 d in the 4-CB group. The 6-CB animals showed elevated levels of Na+, K+-ATPase only at 6 d. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase were induced prenatally in the 4-CB animals but enzyme activities decreased to normal by 55 d of age. Significant depression of activity was evident in the 1-CB and 6-CB groups at -1 d in both enzymes. Dams in the 1-CB group showed significant changes in intestinal monoamine oxidase, serum sorbitol dehydrogenase, and serum alkaline phosphatase. Serum levels were elevated in the 4-CB group. Activities of intestinal enzymes remained unchanged in the 4-CB group. All maternal enzyme levels monitored were not significantly changed in the 6-CB group.
10028686	An analytical method is presented for precise identification and quantitation of 29 specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 15 chlorinated pesticides in human serum. Analyte surrogates PCB 30, PCB 204, 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromo-biphenyl, perthane, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, and dichlorobenzophenone were added to each sample. The serum was extracted with an organic solvent and separated by adsorption chromatography into 3 elution fractions for high-resolution gas chromatographic analysis. Each fraction was analyzed by dual-column capillary chromatography followed by electron capture detection. Two capillary columns, DB-5 and DB-1701, with different polarities were used to increase selectivity for each analyte. Quantitation was performed by selecting 2 sets of calibration standard mixtures and 1,2-dichloronaphthalene as an internal standard. Mean recoveries ranged from 39 to 126% for selected analytes and from 31 to 88% for surrogates. Detection limits for specific congeners and pesticides are reported. Typical chromatographic profiles of calibration standard mixtures, as well as a human sample, are illustrated. Verification of each analyte is assessed, and results of analyses of selected human samples and quality control criteria used to ensure data validity also are presented.
23036451	We investigated whether prenatal exposure from the maternal diet to the toxicants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins is associated with the development of immune-related diseases in childhood. Children participating in BraMat, a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), were followed in the three first years of life using annual questionnaires (0-3years; n=162, 2-3years; n=180), and blood parameters were examined at three years of age (n=114). The maternal intake of the toxicants was calculated using a validated food frequency questionnaire from MoBa. Maternal exposure to PCBs and dioxins was found to be associated with an increased risk of wheeze and more frequent upper respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, maternal exposure to PCBs and dioxins was found to be associated with reduced antibody response to a measles vaccine. No associations were found between prenatal exposure and immunophenotype data, allergic sensitization and vaccine-induced antibody responses other than measles. Our results suggest that prenatal dietary exposure to PCBs and dioxins may increase the risk of wheeze and the susceptibility to infectious diseases in early childhood.
8843553	The New York State Department of Health is performing an investigation of Mohawk men, women, and infants who live at the Akwesasne Reserve along the St. Lawrence River in New York, Ontario, and Quebec Three large industrial facilities bordering the Akwesasne Reserve have seriously contaminated the soil and the sediments and fish of the adjacent St. Lawrence River with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The main study goals are to investigate the associations among the consumption of locally caught fish, residential exposure, body burdens of PCBs, and liver enzyme induction. Contamination with PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE) and other chemicals has been documented in locally caught fish, ducks, and other wildlife. The contamination of fish and wildlife is a major concern of the Mohawk people, since their tradition and culture emphasize the interdependence of man and his environment and because many residents formerly depended heavily on local fish and waterfowl for food. The focus of this research from 1986-1992 was on nursing women and infants. The major purpose of the current project is to determine if there are associations between dietary, residential, and occupational exposures to PCBs and DDE and individual body burdens in Mohawk men, specifically the husbands, partners, fathers, brothers, or other male relatives of the women in our other studies. In other fish-eating populations, adult men have tended to demonstrate higher PCB and DDE body burdens than women and children. Exposure estimates based on the reported consumption of locally caught fish and wildlife and residential histories will be correlated with the specific pattern of PCB congeners found in serum, thereby establishing a direct relationship between two potential sources of exposure and body burdens. Liver function will be examined through the caffeine breath test (CBT), a sensitive, noninvasive method of assessment of enzyme induction, one of the earliest detectable biological responses to PCBs in laboratory animals. This test appears promising as a method to detect subtle subclinical effects before the onset of overt clinical symptoms. The project is among the first to explore differences in dietary and other exposures, body burdens, and potential adverse health effects due to specific PCB congeners in men and women from the same source population.
10903613	In this study, we identified the main hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and other chlorinated phenolic compounds and we determined their relative concentrations in whole blood from 13 male and 17 female Inuit from northern Quebec, Canada, and from a pooled whole blood sample from southern Quebec. We also determined concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Total OH-PCB concentrations were variable among the Inuit samples, ranging over 2 orders of magnitude (0.117-11.6 ng/g whole blood wet weight). These concentrations were equal to and up to 70 times those found for the southern Quebec pooled whole blood sample. Geometric mean concentrations of total OH-PCBs were 1.73 and 1.01 ng/g whole blood for Inuit men and women, respectively, and 0.161 ng/g whole blood for the southern population pool. There are limited data available for comparison, but the levels of OH-PCBs in Inuit are higher than those previously reported in the literature for other populations. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.005) between OH-PCBs and PCBs (r = 0.84) and both correlated significantly (p < 0.005) with age (r = 0.68 and 0.78, respectively). The ratio of OH-PCBs to PCBs was lower in Inuit (0.11) than in the southern Quebec pool (0.33). There is no apparent explanation for the difference. There was considerable variability in the congener pattern of the identified OH-PCBs. The main metabolite, 4-OH-CB109 (4-OH-2,3,3',4', 5-pentachlorobiphenyl), constituted 12-62% of the total OH-PCBs in the samples. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was the dominant phenolic compound in blood, constituting 46% (geometric mean) of the total quantitated chlorinated phenolic compounds. PCP concentrations in Inuit blood ranged from 0.558 to 7.77 ng/g on a wet weight basis. All but two Inuit samples had lower concentrations than the southern Quebec pool (6.29 ng/g). The possible role of OH-PCBs in mediating PCB-induced adverse effects needs to be investigated further.
18054906	We have investigated the relationships among the concentration of total serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), various PCB congener groupings, and three pesticides to total serum lipids in humans with and without self-reported cardiovascular disease. Blood samples were obtained from 335 adult Akwesasne Mohawks, and were analyzed for 101 PCB congeners, mirex, dichloro-diphenyl-dichloro-ethylene (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), as well as serum triglycerides and cholesterol. Structural equation modeling, following the definition of latent variables by means of confirmatory factor analysis, was used to analyze the relationships between serum lipids with PCBs and heart disease. There were significant associations among PCBs, lipids, age, and body mass index (BMI), a fact which justified the application of the structural equation model. Gender of the participant was unrelated to any of the remaining study variables. The results of this study are consistent with a model in which age is considered as both an exogenous explanatory variable and a biological driving mechanism for the acquisition of PCBs. Moreover, the results of this study are consistent with the conclusion that PCBs, acting through P450 enzymes, are directly responsible for increased synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides, substances known to be major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
21280203	SCOPE: The aim of this study was to i) characterize dietary polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin exposure in consumers of fish from the PCB contaminated Lake Mjøsa in Norway ii) examine the influence of demographic factors on blood concentrations and congener composition of dioxins and PCBs, iii) characterize dietary sources and possible exposures above tolerable intake. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples were analysed for dioxin-like (dl) compounds (PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs) and non-dl-PCBs (ndl-PCBs). Dietary exposures were calculated using food frequency questionnaires (n=64). Men had higher median intake of dl-compounds than women (1.2 and 0.85 pg TEQ/kg bw/day), but similar blood concentrations (23.3 and 25.8, pg TEQ/g lipid weight (lw)). For non-dl-PCBs, intakes (6.5 and 4.5 ng/kg bw/day) and blood concentrations (381 and 224 ng/g lw) were higher in men than in women. Blood concentrations correlated with dietary intakes in men only. Increasing BMI and age elevated blood concentrations mainly in women. Men and women had different blood congener profiles, with a higher share of PCB-126 in women, despite similar dietary congener profiles. Eleven participants exceeded the tolerable intake for dl-compounds. Fish from Lake Mjøsa was the main dietary source. CONCLUSION: The higher influence of BMI and age for women than for men may have implications for risk assessment. 
22027556	BACKGROUND: Recent experimental evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase postnatal obesity risk and that these effects may be sex or diet dependent. OBJECTIVES: We explored whether prenatal organochlorine compound (OC) concentrations [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)] were associated with overweight at 6.5 years of age and whether child sex or fat intakes modified these associations. METHODS: We studied 344 children from a Spanish birth cohort established in 1997-1998. Overweight at 6.5 years was defined as a body mass index (BMI) z-score ≥ 85th percentile of the World Health Organization reference. Cord blood OC concentrations were measured and treated as categorical variables (tertiles). Children's diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using generalized linear models. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, we found an increased RR of overweight in the third tertile of PCB exposure [RR = 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 2.64] and the second tertile of DDE exposure (RR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.55), but no association with DDT exposure in the population overall. Associations between overweight and PCB and DDE concentrations were strongest in girls (p-interaction between 0.01 and 0.28); DDT was associated with overweight only in boys. For DDT we observed stronger associations in children with fat intakes at or above compared with below the median, but this interaction was not significant (p-interaction > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that prenatal OC exposures may be associated with overweight in children and that sex and high-fat intake may influence susceptibility. 
12449328	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides, such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) are compounds widespread in the environment, highly lipophilic, and accumulate in biological systems. The newborn are exposed to these organochlorine compounds across the placenta and through breastfeeding. This study reports the levels of selected PCB congeners, p,p'-DDE and HCB in maternal blood and cord blood samples collected at delivery between November and December 1999 from 44 women living in the urban area of Antwerp, Belgium. Results show that all newborns contained detectable levels of PCBs, p,p'-DDE and HCB. The median concentration of PCBs was 450 pg/ml and ranged between 120 and 1580 pg/ml, while the median concentrations of HCB and p,p'-DDE were 70 and 490 pg/ml, respectively. Concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE in cord blood (ng/ml) were positively associated with concentrations in maternal blood (ng/ml) (coefficients=0.74 and 0.92, P<0.05). We conclude that all investigated organochlorine compounds have an efficient transplacental transfer.
14645167	BACKGROUND: Chlorinated organic chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE, the most stable daughter compound of DDT) are persistent lipophilic compounds found in a large portion of the general population. To explore the hypothesis that environmental exposure to these compounds is associated with altered DNA integrity in human sperm, a study of 212 male partners of a sub-fertile couple who presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital Andrology Laboratory was conducted. METHODS: The neutral single cell microgel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) was used to assess DNA integrity in sperm. VisComet image analysis software was used to measure total comet length, the proportion of DNA present in the comet tail, and tail distributed moment, an integrated measure of length and intensity. RESULTS: In the regression analyses, there were no statistically significant consistent associations between the comet assay parameters and any of the individual PCB congeners, sum of PCB, or p,p'-DDE. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there are not strong relationships between adult levels of these chlorinated organic compounds and sperm DNA damage as measured by the comet assay. 
11815763	OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate whether effects of exposure to environmental levels of PCBs and dioxins on development in the Dutch cohort persist until school age. STUDY DESIGN: In the Dutch PCB/dioxin study, cognitive and motor abilities were assessed with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities in children at school age. During infancy, half of this population was fully breast-fed for at least > or = 6 weeks and the other half formula fed. Prenatal exposure to PCBs was defined as the sum of PCB118, 138, 153, and 180 in maternal and cord plasma. In breast milk, additional measurements of 17 dioxins, 6 dioxin-like PCBs, and 20 nondioxin-like PCBs were done. RESULTS: Negative effects of prenatal PCB and dioxin exposure on cognitive and motor abilities were seen when parental and home characteristics were less optimal. These effects were not measurable in children raised in more optimal environments. CONCLUSIONS: Neurotoxic effects of prenatal PCB and dioxin exposure may persist into school age, resulting in subtle cognitive and motor developmental delays. More optimal intellectual stimulation provided by a more advantageous parental and home environment may counteract these effects of prenatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins on cognitive and motor abilities. 
15289169	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are still the most abundant pollutants in wildlife and humans. Hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs) are known to be formed in humans and wildlife. Studies in animals show that these metabolites cause endocrine-related toxicity. The health effects in humans have not yet been evaluated, especially the effect on the fetus and newborn. The aim of this study is to measure the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in maternal and cord blood samples in a population with background levels of PCBs. We analyzed 51 maternal and corresponding cord blood samples in the northern part of the Netherlands. The PCB concentrations in maternal plasma ranged from 2 to 293 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations from nondetectable (ND) to 0.62 ng/g fresh weight. In cord plasma, PCB concentrations were 1-277 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations, ND to 0.47 ng/g fresh weight. The cord versus maternal blood calculated ratio was 1.28 +/- 0.56 for PCBs and 2.11 +/- 1.33 for OH-PCBs, expressed per gram of lipid. When expressed per gram fresh weight, the ratios are 0.32 +/- 0.15 and 0.53 +/- 0.23 for PCBs and OH-PCBs, respectively. A significant correlation between the respective maternal and cord levels for both PCBs and OH-PCBs was found. Our results indicate that OH-PCBs and PCBs are transferred across the placenta to the fetus in concentrations resulting in levels of approximately 50 and 30%, respectively, of those in maternal plasma. More research in humans is needed to evaluate potential negative effects of these endocrine disruptors on the fetus.
20064788	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) comprise a ubiquitous class of toxic substances associated with carcinogenic and tumor-promoting effects as well as neurotoxic properties in the brain. However, the effects of PCBs on the development of tumor metastases are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the hypothesis that exposure to individual PCB congeners can facilitate the development of brain metastases in immunocompetent mice via the disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: C57/Bl6 mice were exposed to individual PCBs by oral gavage, and 48 hr later they were injected with luciferase-labeled K1735 M2 melanoma cells into the internal carotid artery. The development of metastatic nodules was monitored by bioluminescent imaging. In addition, we evaluated the functional permeability of the BBB by measuring permeability of sodium fluorescein across the brain microvessels. Expression and colocalization of tight junction (TJ) proteins were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Oral administration of coplanar PCB126, mono-ortho-substituted PCB118, and non-coplanar PCB153 (each at 150 micromol/kg body weight) differentially altered expression of the TJ proteins claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 in brain capillaries. These alterations were associated with increased permeability of the BBB. Most importantly, exposure to individual PCB congeners enhanced the rate of formation and progression of brain metastases of luciferase-tagged melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that exposure to individual PCBs can facilitate the formation of bloodborne metastases via alterations of the integrity of the brain capillary endothelium. 
12762077	The purpose of this work was to study the effects of high environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other organochlorines on the thyroid. Thyroid volume, hypoechogenicity and nodules (by ultrasound), presence of antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies, and abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in serum (by radioimmunoassay) were examined in 101 adults from the PCB-polluted area in 360 controls. Serum levels of PCBs, hexachlorobenzene, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), p,p'-DDT(1,1,1-trichloro-2,2'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane), and p,p'-DDE(1,1-dichloro-2,2'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene) were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography. Very high levels of PCBs were found in the polluted area (7300 +/- 871 ng/g lipids) compared with controls (2045 +/- 147 ng/g). Positive correlations (P < 0.001) were found between the levels of all organochlorines and their total except for hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH). In the polluted area, the highest thyroid volumes (18.7 +/- 2.32 mL; mean +/- SE) were clustered among 23 subjects (17 males and six females) with PCB levels above 10,000 ng/g (range 10,000-58,667 ng/g). In the remaining 438 subjects the thyroid volume was 14.2 +/- 0.29 mL. These data suggest that there might be a threshold serum PCB level of approximately 10,000 ng/g that may influence the thyroid volume. A two-way ANOVA showed that all thyroid volumes in the polluted area were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in the control area. In males from the polluted area, the frequencies of thyroid hypoechogenicity, thyroid nodules, positive anti-TPO, and abnormal TSH level were higher than in males from the control area, whereas such differences were not observed in females. Increased thyroid volume and indicators of potential thyroid dysfunction were associated with long-term environmental exposure to PCBs. These effects on the thyroid were confined to subjects with PCB levels above 10,000 ng/g of lipid (thyroid volume) and to males from the polluted area (thyroid hypoechogenicity, thyroid nodules, positive anti-TPO, and abnormal TSH).
15743718	Three types of tissue samples--umbilical cord (UC), umbilical cord serum (CS), and maternal serum (MS)--have often been used to assess fetal exposure to chemicals. In order to know the relationship of contamination between mothers and fetuses, we measured persistent chemicals in comparable sets of the three tissue samples. Also, we analyzed the association between the chemicals in maternal and fetal tissues to know which tissue is the best sample for fetal exposure assessment. On a wet basis, the chemical concentrations were of the order MS > CS > UC, except for some chemicals such as cis-chlordane and endosulfan. On a lipid basis, the concentrations in UC were nearly equal or often higher than in MS, but the concentrations in CS were usually lower than in others. Hexachlorocyclohexanes and penta-, hexa-, and heptachlorinated biphenyls showed an association between the concentrations in UC versus MS, and UC versus CS. These chemicals also showed high correlation coefficients between the chemical concentrations in UC of first babies and maternal age. These chemicals were closely related to each other when grouped on the basis of their concentrations using cluster analysis. In conclusion, we insist that UC is the best sample to assess fetal contamination status of persistent chemicals. There is a possibility that the assessment based on the contamination levels in CS result in an underestimation.
21208638	We studied pregnancy-related changes in serum concentrations of five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, CB 118, CB 138, CB 153, CB 156, CB 180), three hydroxylated PCB metabolites (4-OH-CB107, 4-OH-CB146, 4-OH-CB187), and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Median serum lipid content increased 2-fold between early (weeks 9-13) and late pregnancy (weeks 35-36) (N=10), whereas median PCB levels in serum lipids decreased 20-46%, suggesting a dilution of PCB concentrations in serum lipids. Nevertheless, strong positive intra-individual correlations (Spearman's r=0.61-0.99) were seen for PCBs during the whole study period. Thus, if samples have been collected within the same relative narrow time window during pregnancy, PCB results from one single sampling occasion can be used in assessment of relative differences in body burdens during the whole pregnancy period. Concentrations of OH-PCBs in blood serum tended to decline as pregnancy progressed, although among some women the concentrations increased at the end of pregnancy. Positive intra-individual correlations (r=0.66-0.99) between OH-PCB concentrations were observed during the first and second trimester, whereas correlations with third trimester concentrations were more diverging (r=-0.70-0.85). No decline in PCP concentrations was observed during pregnancy and no significant correlations were found between concentrations at different sampling periods. Our results suggest that for both OH-PCBs and PCP, sampling has to be more specifically timed depending on the time period during pregnancy that is of interest. The differences in patterns of intra- and inter-individual variability of the studied compounds may be due to a combination of factors, including lipid solubility, persistence of the compounds, distribution in blood, metabolic formation, and pregnancy-related changes in body composition and physiological processes.
1907125	A study was conducted in the community of Greater New Bedford, Massachusetts, from 1984 through 1987 to assess the prevalence of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the serum of individuals aged 18 to 64 years who had resided in the area for at least 5 years. Eight hundred and forty subjects were interviewed, examined, and tested in a cross-sectional sample of the towns of Acushnet, Dartmouth, and Fairhaven and the city of New Bedford. Serum PCBs were measured to estimate the extent of human exposure. Because of documented environmental contamination by PCBs in the New Bedford area, and the practice of recreational fishing in the harbor for food, a significant number of persons with elevated serum PCB levels were expected to be identified. Instead, the prevalence of elevated serum PCBs in the sample was found to be typical of "unexposed" urban populations in the United States. Only 1.3% of the subjects had serum PCB levels greater than 30 ppb. The same percentage was observed among males (n = 391) and females (n = 449). The geometric means of PCB levels were 4.3 ppb among males (Range = 0.50-60.9) and 4.2 ppb among females (Range = 0.38-154). We conclude that the prevalence of elevated serum PCBs is low in the population of Greater New Bedford.
3110384	The effect of ascorbic acid deficiency and excessive ascorbic acid intake on serum and liver levels of cholesterol and lipids was investigated in ODS-od/od (OD) rats fed a normal diet, a cholesterol-containing diet or a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing diet. The OD rat is a rat mutant unable to synthesize ascorbic acid. In OD rats, the dietary requirement of ascorbic acid to maintain normal growth and normal levels of cholesterol in serum and liver is about 300 mg of ascorbic acid/kg diet. In control (ODS-+/+) rats that can synthesize ascorbic acid, dietary addition of 0.5% cholesterol and 0.25% cholic acid caused elevation of cholesterol concentrations in serum and liver, elevation of total lipids in liver and reduction of the ratio of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum. Dietary addition of PCB (200 mg/kg diet) caused elevation of serum concentration of cholesterol and of the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum. In OD rats fed a normal diet, ascorbic acid deficiency slightly elevated serum concentration of cholesterol, elevated liver concentration of cholesterol and reduced the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum; and ascorbic acid excess did not affect serum and liver concentrations of cholesterol and the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum. In OD rats fed a cholesterol-containing diet, ascorbic acid deficiency elevated serum and liver concentrations of cholesterol, and did not affect the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum; and ascorbic acid excess did not affect serum and liver concentrations of cholesterol and the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
21699966	The release of PCBs from sealant material in public buildings and the resulting indoor air levels have raised growing concerns about possible human health effects connected with this exposure. Ambient monitoring of PCBs in a public building has revealed a contamination with the more volatile lower chlorinated PCB 28, PCB 52 and PCB 101. This gave reason for a large biological monitoring study in order to examine the internal exposure to PCBs in persons working in that building. Blood samples from 209 persons employed in the PCB-contaminated building were drawn. 98 persons matched for age and gender working in non-contaminated buildings served as control group. Plasma samples were analysed for the six indicator PCBs (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) and 12 dioxin-like PCBs using GC/MS (LOD: 0.01 μg/L). Significant differences between both collectives were only found for the plasma levels of the lower chlorinated PCB 28, PCB 52 and PCB 101 and for the dioxin-like congeners PCB 105 and PCB 118, which are due to inhalative exposure to these congeners via indoor air. Median plasma levels of PCB 28, PCB 52 and PCB 101 in the employees of the contaminated building were 0.087 μg/L, 0.024 μg/L and 0.012 μg/L, respectively. The concentrations of the higher chlorinated PCBs and all other dioxin-like congeners investigated were within the normal range of the general population. There was no relationship between indoor air measurements and internal exposure of the employees in the corresponding office, but estimated lifetime exposure of the employees turned out to be a significant factor for plasma levels of PCB 28. Our biomonitoring results served as a basis for individual risk communication and successful risk management.
15175172	In this nested case-control study we examined the relationship between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and organochlorine pesticide exposure. We used a data set originally collected between 1969 and 1983 in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Human Adipose Tissue Survey. Adipose samples were randomly collected from cadavers and surgical patients, and levels of organochlorine pesticide residues were determined. From the original study population, 175 NHL cases were identified and matched to 481 controls; 173 controls were selected from accident victims, and 308 from cases with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Cases and controls were mainly from cadavers (> 96%) and were matched on sex, age, region of residence within the United States, and race/ethnicity. Conditional logistic regression showed the organochlorine pesticide residue heptachlor epoxide to be significantly associated with NHL [compared with the lowest quartile: third quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-3.28; fourth quartile OR = 3.41, 95% CI, 1.89-6.16]. The highest quartile level of dieldrin was also associated with elevated NHL risk (OR = 2.70; 95% CI, 1.58-4.61), as were higher levels of oxychlordane, p,p'-DDE [p,p'-1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene], and ss-benzene hexachloride (ORs = 1.79, 1.99, and 2.47, respectively). The p-values for trends for these associations were significant. In models containing pairs of pesticides, only heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin remained significantly associated with risk of NHL. Limitations of this study include collection of samples after diagnosis and a lack of information on variables affecting organochlorine levels such as diet, occupation, and body mass index. Given the persistence of pesticides in the environment, these findings are still relevant today.
9354175	The presence of organochlorine pesticides, such as p,p'-DDT[2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethanel, and of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum and adipose tissue has been reported in many studies over the last four decades. Recently, debate has heightened concerning the link of these compounds to breast cancer. To clarify and resolve this issue, accurate analytical residue data must be obtained. Separation of the organochlorine pesticides from the PCBs in breast tissue is critical to obtaining valid residue data. Based on methods refined in the Analytical Laboratory at Colorado State University, accurate residue levels were established for nine individual PCB congeners and eight organochlorine pesticides. The breast adipose tissue method used was a modification of the Mills et al. and de Faubert Maunder et al. methods. The serum method employed was a modification of the Burse et al. method. Both breast adipose tissue and serum from 36 women were analyzed, and correlations of the residues from the two substrates were evaluated. Serum concentrations of p,p'-DDE, the primary metabolite of p,p'-DDT, were correlated (alpha = .05) with the concentrations of p,p'-DDE in human breast adipose tissue (r = .808). Serum concentrations of the PCB congener BZ 153 were also significantly correlated to the human breast adipose tissue concentrations of BZ 153 (r = .377). No significant relationship was found between serum concentrations and tissue residues for 15 of the 17 compounds analyzed. This lack of correlation between breast adipose tissue and serum, as well as an absence of the compound residues in serum, emphasized that adipose tissue should be analyzed in addition to serum to fully understand the relationship of the organochlorine compounds to breast cancer.
19932013	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental toxicants, which affect male fertility by altering the androgen and estrogen levels. PCB-induced toxic manifestations are associated with the production of reactive oxygen species. Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is a major lipophilic chain breaking antioxidant, which protects polyunsaturated fatty acids in tissues against peroxidation, a property that could be beneficial in the male reproductive biology. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of α-tocopherol on PCB (Aroclor 1254)-induced changes in androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptors (ERs) expression in Wistar rat ventral prostate. Rats were divided into 3 groups of 6 animals each. Group I rats were administered corn oil (vehicle) intraperitoneally (i.p.); Group II rats were treated with 2 mg kg(-1)day(-1) of PCB (i.p.); Group III rats were treated with 2 mg kg(-1)day(-1) of PCB (i.p.) along with simultaneous oral supplementation of 50 mg kg(-1)day(-1) of α-tocopherol. Serum testosterone and estradiol titers were assayed. Prostatic acid phosphatase activity (PAcP), citric acid concentration, generation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and lipid peroxides (LPO) were estimated. mRNA and protein expression of AR, ER-α and ER-β in ventral prostate were quantified. Serum testosterone, estradiol, PAcP, citric acid levels, AR and ER-α expressions were significantly decreased while H(2)O(2) generation, LPO, ER-β were increased in PCB-exposed animals. Simultaneous supplementation of α-tocopherol in PCB-exposed rats resulted in significant restoration of all the parameters to the control. The results suggest that α-tocopherol has definite protective effect against PCB-induced toxicity in ventral prostatic dysfunction.
8711465	Estimates of the half-lives of PCBs in humans derived from successive body burden measurements are reviewed and found to vary widely whether based on congener-specific or aggregate data. Variability due to differences in physiological processes among individuals and in congener properties is to be expected, but does not appear to be a complete explanation. Very short half-lives (i.e. < 1 year) are unlikely for those congeners most frequently found in human blood because the exposures required to sustain observed body burdens are too large to be easily explained. Very long half-lives ( > 10 years) may be artifacts of confounding by ongoing exposures (a common effect at low body burdens) and are also suspect. The loss of significant quantities of PCBs from the blood of occupationally exposed persons with half-lives of 2-6 years is comparatively well documented (i.e. has been observed in studies with relatively large numbers of subjects and high initial body burdens). Therefore, very long half-lives must be limited to subsets of congeners or of populations if they occur at all. The impact of the use of fixed estimates of half-lives drawn from the tails of the observed range on the evaluation of regulatory standards is shown to be substantial.
18550560	In this study, the authors' objective was to determine whether serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE) are associated with thyroid function during pregnancy. These compounds, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone, total thyroxine, and free thyroxine, were measured in serum samples collected between October 1999 and October 2000 from 334 pregnant women living in the Salinas Valley, California. Data were analyzed by multivariate linear regression. After adjustment for covariates, seven of the 19 PCB congeners detected in more than 75% of participants and the sum of those congeners were negatively associated with free thyroxine concentrations. PCBs 44, 52, and 183 remained significant after the exclusion of two outliers. Hexachlorobenzene concentrations were negatively associated with both free thyroxine and total thyroxine. PCB and hexachlorobenzene concentrations were strongly correlated, which hampered the authors' ability to identify their independent associations with thyroid function. None of the exposures under study were associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone. Results suggest that exposure to PCBs and/or hexachlorobenzene at background levels may affect thyroid function during pregnancy. These findings are of particular significance, since thyroid hormones of maternal origin may play an essential role in fetal neurodevelopment.
16201671	In this study, the authors investigated the associations between socioeconomic status and exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in a cohort of inner-city African-American pregnant women. Data for this study were derived from the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center subcohort of the National Collaborative Perinatal Project. African-American women from whom venous blood had been collected during their third trimester of pregnancy during the time period between 1960 and 1965 were included in the current study (n = 152). Prenatal samples were assayed for PCB and DDE concentrations. The authors used linear-regression analysis to explore the association between socioeconomic indicators and PCB and DDE concentrations. Mean concentrations of the 4 most abundant congeners (i.e., PCB4) and total DDE were 3.9 microg/l and 37.2 microg/l, respectively. In adjusted analyses, income was associated significantly with an increase in serum concentrations of PCBs, whereas education was not. Neither income nor education was associated with concentrations of DDE. The authors concluded that maternal socioeconomic indicators may influence the effects of exposure to PCBs among African-American pregnant women.
10999346	Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure has been linked to a variety of toxic effects in animal experiments and in certain human case reports and epidemiologic studies. A total of 209 individual PCB congeners are possible, based on chlorination level and ring substitution pattern. Commercial PCBs are a complex mixture of congeners, and over 75 of these have been reported to be present in human tissues at widely varying levels. Because the biologic activity of individual PCBs is a function of extent and pattern of chlorine substitution, "congener-specific" PCB analysis of human tissue has gained increasing importance in assessing possible links between PCB exposure and toxic effects. A high-sensitivity analytical method using dual-column gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detection (ECD) for determining 101 PCB congeners (83 individual, 18 as pairs/triplets) plus 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and mirex, in human serum is described. Separation is performed concurrently on parallel-configured DB-5 and Apiezon-L capillary columns. The current method is a modification of previously reported dual-column GC-ECD systems with improvements to the extraction and analytical protocols and the implementation of a comprehensive QA/QC program. The method employs two surrogate standards (PCBs IUPAC 125 and 192) and internal standard (IUPAC 104)-based quantitation, in addition to per-batch check standards and method blanks. Although optimized for serum, the method is applicable to all human, experimental animal, and environmental biota samples. The accuracy, precision, and reliability of the method were assessed using a variety of QA/QC endpoints. Finally, the use of the method in determining level and prevalence of PCB congeners in a cohort of adult Native-American individuals with historical environmental PCB exposure is reported.
19389042	Polychlorinated biphenyls are one of the environmental toxicants and neurotoxic compounds which induce the production of free radicals. Creatine kinase plays a key role in energy metabolism of nervous tissue and might be one of the targets for reactive oxygen species. Melatonin, an indoleamine, plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases as an antioxidant and neuroprotector. The objective of the present study was to investigate the protective role of melatonin on polychlorinated biphenyl (Aroclor 1254)-induced oxidative stress and the changes in creatine kinase activity in brain regions of adult rats. Group I: rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered with corn oil (vehicle) for 30 days. Group II: rats injected i.p. with Aroclor 1254 at 2 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day for 30 days. Groups III and IV: rats i.p. received melatonin (5 or 10 mg/kg bw/day) simultaneously with Aroclor 1254 for 30 days. After 30 days, rats were killed and the brain regions were dissected to cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Lipid peroxidation, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were determined. The activity of creatine kinase was assayed in serum and brain regions, and its isoenzymes in serum were separated electrophoretically. Activity of creatine kinase was decreased while an increase in H2O2, hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxidation was observed in brain regions of polychlorinated biphenyl-treated rats. Also polychlorinated biphenyl exposure showed a significant increase in serum creatine kinase level and its isoforms such as BB-creatine kinase, MB-creatine kinase, and MM-creatine kinase. Administration of melatonin prevented these alterations induced by polychlorinated biphenyl by its free radical scavenging mechanism. Thus, polychlorinated biphenyl alters creatine kinase activity by inducing oxidative stress in brain regions, which can be protected by melatonin.
10334636	OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate relationships of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with breast cancer, we conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort using the Columbia, Missouri Breast Cancer Serum Bank. METHODS: Women donated blood in 1977-87, and during up to 9.5 years follow-up, 105 donors who met the inclusion criteria for the current study were diagnosed with breast cancer. For each case, two controls matched on age and date of blood collection were selected. Five DDT [2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane] analogs, 13 other organochlorine pesticides, and 27 PCBs were measured in serum. RESULTS: Women in the upper three quartiles of hexachlorobenzene were at twice the risk of breast cancer compared to those in the lowest quartile. However, there was no evidence for a dose-response relationship, and the association was limited to women whose blood was collected close to the time of diagnosis. Women with higher serum levels of other organochlorine pesticides and PCBs showed no increased risk of breast cancer overall, although positive associations were suggested for PCB-118 and PCB-138 when blood was collected close to the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study do not support a role for organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in breast cancer etiology. 
16371417	The objective of the present study was to identify PCB-indicators of occupational exposure related to the removal of old elastic sealants. Blood samples were collected from workers involved in removing elastic sealants. Samples were also taken from age- and sex-matched controls. A majority of the exposed workers were re-sampled after 10 months. All samples were analysed for 19 PCBs. The levels in the exposed workers were twice as high as those in the controls, 575 and 267 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively, but were essentially unchanged at the second sampling. The PCB patterns also differed. Levels of many less chlorinated PCBs were much higher in the exposed workers, compared to the controls, and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that easily metabolized PCBs decreased in the exposed workers during the study. This finding indicates that elimination exceeded uptake during the study period, and that the safety information given to the workers had been effective. PCA was also used to identify exposure markers. The relatively persistent PCBs 56/60 and 66, the easily metabolized PCBs 44, 70 and 110 (with vicinal hydrogens in meta/para-positions) and the very persistent PCBs 153 and 180 were found to be good markers for occupational, recent occupational and background (dietary) exposure, respectively. A PCA model based on these markers was equally effective in differentiating between exposed individuals and controls, and between recent and less recent exposure, as a model based on all PCBs.
12883090	There are concerns that postnatal exposure to organochlorines present in breast milk could lead to adverse health effects. We reconstituted four mixtures of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists (3 non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], 6 polychlorinated dibenzodioxins [PCDDs], 7 polychlorinated dibenzofurans [PCDFs], or all 16 chemicals together [referred to as AhRM]) based on their concentrations in breast milk, and examined their effects following exposure by gavage from day 1 until day 20 of age. Female neonates received dosages of AhRM equivalent to 1, 10, 100, or 1000 times the amount consumed by an infant over the first 24 days of life. Other groups received the PCBs, the PCDDs, or the PCDFs at the 1000x level. All rats were sacrificed at 21 days of age. Changes in ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase hepatic activity, thymus and body weights, and serum thyroxin were linked to the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalents (TEQ) of the four mixtures (1000x-AhRM > PCDDs > PCBs > PCDFs). To test for AhRM antiestrogenicity, two additional groups received 1.5 microg/kg of 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE) with or without the 1000x-AhRM. The AhRM had no effect on uterine weight or EE-stimulated uterine growth. The actions of the combined EE and AhRM treatments suggest additive effects in decreasing pentoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity and spleen weight, but nonadditive/antagonistic effects on adrenal weight and serum thyroxin. In conclusion, (1) 10x-AhRM had no detectable effects, (2) TEQ values relate to observed toxicities, even when testing complex mixtures of AhR agonists, and (3) indications of tissue-specific additive and nonadditive/antagonistic effects, but no synergism, were observed when doses of AhRM were increased, or combined with EE.
9465259	Phenobarbital (PB), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlordane (CLD) increase liver tumor incidences in rodents, and all are tumor promoters. Most indirect tests for DNA reactivity, including mutagenicity and chromosomal damage, have been negative with these agents. Consequently, the modes of action for tumorigenesis by these compounds are not believed to involve direct DNA reactivity; however, only limited information from direct tests is available for the lack of DNA adduct formation. PB, PCBs, and CLD were tested for DNA adduct formation in the liver of male and female B6C3F1 mice after either single or 2-week dietary exposures. Single gavage dose levels were as follows: PB, 200 mg/kg; PCBs, 50 mg/kg; and CLD, 50 mg/kg. Dietary dose levels were as follows: PB, 1000 ppm; PCBs, 200 ppm and CLD, 200 ppm. Animals were killed 24 h following the end of test-substance administration. DNA was extracted from the liver, and DNA adduct concentrations were enriched using either 1-butanol extraction of adducted nucleotides or nuclease P1 digestion of unadducted nucleotides. Using this protocol, none of the three test compounds produced DNA adducts detected by 32P-postlabeling. Similar negative results were obtained for DNA from the livers of both male and female mice receiving either single or 2-week exposures. The two positive controls, benzidine for the 1-butanol extraction procedure and 2-acetylaminofluorene for the nuclease P1 procedure, showed the expected patterns of DNA adducts. These results support the conclusion that the carcinogenicity of PB, PCBs, and CLD in experimental animals is not the result of direct DNA reactivity, but involves epigenetic mechanisms.
3921361	Correlations of blood polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels or PCB patterns and blood pressures were studied in 59 patients with yusho (PCB poisoning) above 40 years old. In spite of the passage of 13 years from the onset, 52.5% of these patients still have PCB levels higher than the range found in the general population. The frequency of hypertension in the patients was 16.9%, a value similar to that expected on the basis of the rate for a population of the same age and sex compositions. As an independent variable, the blood pressure of patients was not associated with blood PCB levels and PCB patterns. No PCB blood pressure association was confirmed in 20 patients with PCB levels persistently higher than 5 ppb for 9 years. On the other hand, age, obesity and habitual alcohol intake, known influencing factors for hypertension, tended to be positively associated with elevated blood pressure in these yusho patients.
18569566	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), persistent environmental contaminants, may affect neurodevelopment of infants following prenatal exposure. A negative impact of prenatal PCB exposure on neurodevelopment was found in the Dusseldorf (Germany) cohort study (1993-2000). PCB levels of the sum of the three indicator congeners in breast milk were negatively associated with mental/motor development as assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) in infants. Since general exposure to PCB has decreased, a new birth cohort study was initiated in 2000 in the industrial city of Duisburg, which is located 30 km downstream from Dusseldorf on the River Rhine. A subgroup of the Duisburg birth cohort study was used to compare PCB exposure and developmental effects with results from the Dusseldorf cohort. The recruitment phase of the Duisburg cohort study occurred from 2000 to 2002. Mental and motor development was assessed by means of the BSID at the ages of 12 and 24 mo. Prenatal PCB exposure of newborns from Duisburg cohort was about two- to threefold lower than the Dusseldorf cohort. Although in the Dusseldorf birth cohort mental and motor development at ages 18 and 30 mo were negatively associated with PCB exposure, there was no association observed in the Duisburg study. Evidence indicates that exposure to PCB at current exposure levels no longer apparently impair neurodevelopment of infants.
20537684	European Union regulation has defined maximum levels for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in food from animal origin. In case of particular event where livestock is potentially exposed to a specific source of contamination, the possibility of accurate estimation of the PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB levels in edible tissues of the animals from in vivo and weakly invasive biological matrices (fast animal recovery, no major side effects) may be of clear valuable interest. This study investigated the correlations between contamination levels determined in subcutaneous adipose tissue and blood samples obtained from living animals and those measured after slaughtering in muscle and liver. The obtained results demonstrated very good correlations between these in vivo and ex vivo samples in terms of PCDD/F and PCB contamination levels. Finally, it seems to be demonstrated that a weakly invasive biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue performed on living animal (potentially completed by a blood sample) can be used in order to predict contamination levels in muscle and liver destined to human consumption.
17805422	BACKGROUND: Few data are available on polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations over critical windows of human reproduction and development inclusive of the periconception window. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to measure changes in PCB concentrations from preconception to pregnancy, through pregnancy, or after a year without becoming pregnant. METHODS: Seventy-nine women planning pregnancies were prospectively enrolled and followed for up to 12 menstrual cycles of attempting pregnancy. Blood specimens were obtained from participating women preconceptionally (n = 79), after a positive pregnancy test leading to a live birth (n = 54) or pregnancy loss (n = 10), at approximately 6 weeks postpartum (n = 53), and after 12 unsuccessful cycles (n = 9) for toxicologic analysis of 76 PCB congeners. We estimated overall and daily rate of change in PCB concentration (nanograms per gram serum) adjusting for relevant covariates, serum lipids, and baseline PCB concentration. RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.0001) decreases in the mean overall and daily rate of change in PCB concentrations were observed between the preconception and first pregnancy samples for total (-1.012 and -0.034, respectively), estrogenic (-0.444 and -0.016, respectively), and antiestrogenic (-0.106 and -0.004, respectively) PCBs among women with live births. Similar significant decreases in total (-1.452 and -0.085), estrogenic (-0.647 and -0.040), and antiestrogenic (-0.093 and -0.004) PCB concentrations were seen for women with pregnancy losses. No significant changes were observed for PCB congener 153. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PCB concentrations may change during the periconception interval, questioning the stability of persistent compounds during this critical window. 
21968773	BACKGROUND: Animal studies have demonstrated that timing of pubertal onset can be altered by prenatal exposure to dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but studies of human populations have been quite limited. METHODS: We assessed the association between maternal serum concentrations of dioxins and PCBs and the sons' age of pubertal onset in a prospective cohort of 489 mother-son pairs from Chapaevsk, Russia, a town contaminated with these chemicals during past industrial activity. The boys were recruited at ages 8 to 9 years, and 4 years of annual follow-up data were included in the analysis. Serum samples were collected at enrollment from both mothers and sons for measurement of dioxin and PCB concentrations using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The sons' pubertal onset--defined as pubertal stage 2 or higher for genitalia (G) or pubic hair (P), or testicular volume >3 mL--was assessed annually by the same physician. RESULTS: In multivariate Cox models, elevated maternal serum PCBs were associated with earlier pubertal onset defined by stage G2 or higher (4th quartile hazard ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 1.1- 2.5]), but not for stage P2 or higher or for testicular volume >3 mL. Maternal serum concentrations of dioxin toxic equivalents were not consistently associated with the sons' pubertal onset, although a dose-related delay in pubertal onset (only for G2 or higher) was seen among boys who breast-fed for 6 months or more. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal PCB serum concentrations measured 8 or 9 years after sons' births--which may reflect sons' prenatal and early-life exposures--were associated with acceleration in some, but not all, measures of pubertal onset. 
7818287	Blood samples were collected from 28 mothers and from 38 school-aged children from Michigan farms on which there were polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated silos. The samples were analyzed for PCBs and other contaminants, including polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT + p,p'-DDE) via packed column gas chromatography. The PCBs were quantified, using the Webb-McCall method, with Aroclors 1016 and 1260 used as reference standards. Approximately 42% of the children had serum PCB levels above the detection limit of 3.0 ng/ml. The values ranged from 3.1 to 23.3 ng/ml, with a mean of 6.8 ng/ml. In contrast, PCBs were detected in 86% of the mothers. The mean serum concentration was somewhat higher for the mothers (9.6 ng/ml), but the range was similar to that found for the children. PBBs were not detected in any of the children, but were present in trace amounts in 25% of the mothers. Conversely, DDT was present in 66% of the children and 93% of the mothers. As with PCBs, DDT concentrations were somewhat higher in the mothers. DDE accounted for 89% of the total DDT in serum. Various potential sources of exposure were evaluated as possible determinants of serum PCB levels, using hierarchical multiple regression. Years of residence on a silo farm and consumption of PCB-contaminated Great Lakes fish both accounted for significant portions of the variance in maternal serum PCB levels. Exposure via breast-feeding explained a large and highly significant proportion of the variance in the children's serum PCB concentrations, suggesting that breast milk was the primary source of PCB exposure for these children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
22078547	Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic chemicals that are highly resistant to biodegradation and have proven adverse health effects. The objectives of this study were to determine concentrations of three selected organochlorine pesticides (p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, HCB) and three specific PCB congeners (PCB 138, 153, 180) in adipose tissue and serum samples from an urban adult population (n=112) in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and to investigate their relationships within and between the two matrices and with selected socio-demographic characteristics. The percentages of samples positive for these compounds ranged from 40% for PCB 180 to 100% for p,p'-DDE in adipose tissue, and from 21% for HCB to 93% for p,p'-DDE in serum. Median number of residues per sample was five for adipose tissue and three for serum. Geometric mean concentrations indicate a considerable historical and recent exposure to organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in this population. Adipose tissue:serum ratios ranged from 149.3 to 590.3 (wet basis) and from 0.9 to 3.5 (lipid basis). We found positive and statistically significant correlations between adipose tissue and serum concentrations only in p,p'-DDE and HCB. This novel study in Bolivia underlines the need for human biomonitoring to assess exposure to environmental pollutants in South America.
12002477	One bottle of Yusho rice oil was obtained from a Yusho family in 1998. The levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the causal oil were investigated with two different approaches and the individual concentrations of all the 17 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F and 14 coplanar PCB (Co-PCB) congeners were elucidated for the first time. The concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs were found to be 0.60 and 8.8 ppm, respectively. For PCBs, more than 130 PCB peaks were observed and a total concentration of 850 ppm including 170 ppm of Co-PCBs was obtained. The toxic equivalents (TEQs) of PCDDs, PCDFs, and Co-PCBs were calculated to be 17, 470, and 120 ppb, respectively. The relative contribution of these classes to the total TEQ in Yusho oil is 3%, 77%, and 20%, respectively, indicating that PCDFs play a major role in the toxicity of Yusho oil. Furthermore, it was confirmed that 2,3,4,7,8-penta-CDF contributes 58% to the total TEQ, supporting the view that this compound is the principal causal agent in Yusho poisoning. It is noteworthy that the most toxic 2.3,7,8-tetra-CDD was newly discovered, although it contributes only 0.1% to the total TEQ. Based on our data, the smallest TEQ intake during the latent period was estimated to be 0.067 mg for Yusho patients. This value is about 60% of that previously reported, suggesting a lower minimum threshold level for the development of the toxic symptoms of Yusho.
1906267	Children exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) while playing with parts of a capacitor had elevated serum concentrations of lower chlorinated PCBs, similar to Arochlor 1242. These levels declined over 11 months of followup to about half their initial values, from a mean of 12.9 to 6.3 ppb (parts per billion, ng/mL) among four children. In comparison, other persons in the same household and a reference group of persons seen in the same geographic area had serum levels of Aroclor 1242-like PCBs below the limit of detection (less than 5 ppb). All three groups--the children, household members, and geographic referents--also had higher chlorinated PCBs in their serum similar to Aroclor 1260 (HPCBs). HPCB concentrations were similar in these groups (approximately 2 ppb) and did not decline significantly.
19233261	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic industrial chemicals, complete carcinogens, and efficacious tumor promoters. However, the mechanism(s) of PCB-mediated carcinogenicity remains largely undefined. One likely pathway by which these agents may play a role in carcinogenesis is the generation of oxidative DNA damage by redox cycling of dihydroxylated PCB metabolites. We have now employed a new (32)P-postlabeling system to examine novel oxidative DNA lesions induced by Cu(2+)-mediated activation of PCB metabolites. (32)P postlabeling of DNA incubated with various PCB metabolites resulted in over a dozen novel polar oxidative DNA adducts that were chromatographically similar for all active agents. The most potent metabolites tested were the hydroquinones (hydroxyl groups arranged para to each other), yielding polar oxidative adduct levels ranging from 55 to 142 adducts/10(6) nucleotides. PCB catechols, or ortho-dihydroxy metabolites, were up to 40% less active than their corresponding hydroquinone congeners, whereas monohydroxylated and quinone metabolites did not produce detectable oxidative damage over that of vehicle. With the exception of 2,4,5-Cl-2',5'-dihydroxybiphenyl, this oxidative DNA damage seemed to be inversely related to chlorine content: no chlorine approximately mono->di->trichlorinated metabolites. Importantly, copper, but not iron, was essential for activation of the PCB metabolites to these polar oxidative DNA adducts, because in its absence or in the presence of the Cu(+)-specific scavenger bathocuproine, no adducts were detected. Intervention studies with known reactive oxygen species (ROS) modifiers suggested that H(2)O(2), singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide may also be involved in this PCB-mediated oxidative DNA damage. These data indicate a mechanistic role for several ROS, in addition to copper, in PCB-induced DNA damage and provide further support for oxidative DNA damage in PCB-mediated carcinogenesis.
18197307	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental toxicants, for which animal studies demonstrate immunotoxic effects, including thymic atrophy and suppressed immune responses; human investigations of similar end points are sparse. The thymus is essential for the differentiation and maturation of T-cell lymphocytes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the association between prenatal PCB exposures and estimated thymus volume in infants from eastern Slovakia, a region where PCBs were produced until 1984. METHODS: Mothers were enrolled at delivery, and maternal blood samples were collected for analysis of 15 PCB congeners, p,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], and p,p'-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene]. Each mother was interviewed to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics, past pregnancies, occupational history, medication history, and living environment. Neonatal thymus volume was estimated using ultrasound measurements on the third or fourth day after birth. Thymic index was calculated on 982 newborns from mothers with PCB measurements. We developed a predictive model of the natural log of the thymic index using multiple linear regression with covariates selected from the bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Prenatal PCB exposure was associated with a smaller thymic index at birth [beta= -36 (natural log-transformed; nanograms per gram lipids); p = 0.047]. District of residence and delivery also predicted thymic index. Male sex, later gestational age, larger birth weight z-score, and Roma ethnicity were associated with a larger thymic index, whereas respiratory illness was associated with a lower thymic index. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence to date that PCB exposure in neonates is associated with a smaller thymic volume, suggesting possible impaired immunologic development. 
17267299	An improved method for the determination of selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum was developed. The method requires low volume of serum (500 microl) and 48-96 samples per day can be prepared by one analyst without special automatic equipment. Initial extraction was performed using 96-well solid-phase extraction disk plates and was followed by a clean-up with silica gel/sulfuric acid. Different denaturation, elution and clean-up conditions were tested. Quantification was carried out by gas chromatography equipped with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) or mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Recoveries of PCB congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180 and OCPs HCB, beta-HCH, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT at two spiking levels (n=8) varied from 57 to 120%, and intra-day relative standard deviation from 1 to 11%, both depending on spiking level and compound. Inter-day relative standard deviation was <15% in all cases. Limit of quantification (LOQ) for these PCBs ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 ng/ml and for these OCPs from 0.16 to 0.40 ng/ml. The optimized method was applied to the analysis of 1000 serum samples from different places of Spain.
19439357	We are studying participants selected from the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS), a longitudinal birth cohort of over 20,000 California pregnancies between 1959 and 1967, for associations between maternal body burden of organochlorine contaminants and thyroid function. We designed a pilot study using 30 samples selected among samples with high and low PCB concentrations to evaluate the feasibility of measuring OH-PCBs in the larger study population. GC-ECD and GC-NCI/MS were used to determine PCBs and OH-PCBs as methyl derivatives, respectively. Maternal serum levels of Sigma11PCBs and Sigma8OH-PCB metabolites varied from 0.74 to 7.99 ng/mL wet wt. with a median of 3.05 ng/mL, and from 0.12 to 0.98 ng/mL wet wt. with a median of 0.39 ng/mL, respectively. Average concentrations of Sigma8OH-PCB metabolites in the high PCB group were significantly higher than those in the low PCB group (p < 0.05). The levels of OH-PCB metabolites were dependent on PCB levels (r = 0.58, p < 0.05) but approximately an order of magnitude lower (p < 0.05). The average ratio of Sigma8OH-PCBs to Sigma11PCBs was 0.14 +/- 0.08. The primary metabolite was 4-OH-CB187 followed by 4-OH-CB107. Both of these metabolites interfere with the thyroid system in in vitro, animal, and human studies. OH-PCBs were detectable in all archived sera analyzed, supporting the feasibility to measure OH-PCB metabolites in the entire cohort.
15315812	Early-life exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, increases the hearing threshold at selected frequencies in rats. Among humans from the Faroe Islands with unusually high early-life PCB exposure, exposure was directly associated with increased hearing thresholds at two frequencies, although the deficits were present in the left ear but not the right. We examined PCB levels in maternal pregnancy serum in relation with audiometrically determined hearing thresholds among offspring when they were of school age. Complete data were available for 195 children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and 615 children selected at random, all of whom were born in 1959-1966 in the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) U.S. cohort. The median exposure among those selected at random, as reflected by the mother's third trimester serum total PCB concentration, was 2.8 microg/l, about twofold higher than recent background levels in the United States. Based on the average hearing threshold across the frequencies essential for speech recognition in the "worst ear," the maternal serum PCB level was unrelated to the adjusted odds of SNHL or to adjusted mean hearing threshold. Overall, an adverse effect of early-life, background-level PCB exposure on SNHL was not supported by these data.
17365608	In laboratory experiments, planar PCBs produce immune organ atrophy in chicken embryos. To study the immunotoxic effects of PCBs in birds, the coplanar congeners 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) and 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) were injected into the air cell of fertile white leghorn chicken eggs before incubation at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 ng/g egg PCB 126 and 0.64 ng/g egg PCB 77. Mortality and deformities were assessed during incubation of the eggs, and immune function was analyzed post-hatch using phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test for T-cell mediated immunity, antibody titers to sheep red blood cells (SRBC), mitogenesis of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and immune organ mass and cellularity. Exposure to 0.25 ng/g PCB 126 elevated mortality (61% and 69%) and deformities (31% and 32%), three or more times higher than controls. Two-fold suppression of antibody titers was observed in 28 day old chicks exposed to PCB 126 or PCB 77. No consistent alterations in PHA skin response or lymphocyte proliferation were observed. In 14 day old chicks in experiment two, PCB 126 decreased thymus and bursa cellularity by 33% and 35%, respectively. Immune organ atrophy was transient, recovering to control levels by 42 days of age. These experiments demonstrate that PCB 126 and 77 suppress antibody responses in juvenile chickens following an in ovo PCB exposure. Results reinforce the need for measuring multiple immune endpoints to detect immunotoxicity.
17938741	BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may alter neurodevelopment in both humans and animals. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to some PCB congeners and commercial mixtures has been shown to decrease free and total thyroxine (T(4)) blood levels in animals. Because thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for normal neurologic development, it has been suggested that the deleterious neurodevelopmental effect of PCBs may occur through TH disruption. PCBs may in turn affect TH levels by inducing the microsomal enzyme uridinediphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT), which is involved in TH elimination. OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to group PCB congeners based on their potential to induce microsomal enzymes in animals, and to examine the relationship between neonatal TSH levels and prenatal exposure to PCB congeners grouped according to their structure and potential mechanisms of action. METHODS: We measured the concentration of 34 PCB congeners in serum samples collected from 285 pregnant women and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in their children's blood collected shortly after birth. RESULTS: We found no association between the sum of PCB congeners, the toxic equivalents, or structure-based groupings (mono- or di-ortho substituted congeners), and TSH blood concentration. However, we found a positive association between the sum of congeners suspected to be UDP-GT inducers (more specifically cytochrome P450 2B inducers) in animals and neonatal TSH levels. In individual congener analyses, PCBs 99, 138, 153, 180, 183, 187, 194, and 199 were positively associated with neonatal TSH levels after adjustment for covariates. PCBs 194 and 199 remained significant after adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support grouping PCB congeners based on their potential mechanism of action of enzyme induction when investigating associations with TH. Findings also suggest that PCBs affect TH homeostasis even at the low background level of exposure found in the CHAMA-COS (Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas) population. 
21152889	The aim of this work was to evaluate contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls and mercury in soil, and to assess exposure level to both contaminants in children living in San Felipe, Nuevo Mercurio, Zacatecas, Mexico. We found soil levels of total polychlorinated biphenyls ranging from non detectable (nd) to 190 μg/kg. Mercury soil levels ranged from 8.9 to 10215.0 mg/kg. Exposure levels of total polychlorinated biphenyls assessed in blood and urinary mercury in children living in the studied community were 1,600 ± 8,800 ng/g lipid and 4.2 ± 7.1 μg/g creatinine, respectively.
15589248	Analysis of blood samples is an effective way of evaluating contamination by persistent pollutants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin/furans (PCDD/Fs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human population. Concentrations of PBDEs, PCDD/Fs and PCBs were measured in the blood of laborers (n = 13) working full time in two different municipal waste incinerator (MWI) plants and residents from the general population (n = 22) living in areas near MWIs in Korea. The concentrations of PBDEs were found to be slightly higher in the blood of incineration workers (8.61-46.05 ng/g lipid; mean, 19.33 ng/g lipid; median, 15.94 ng/g lipid) in comparison to that of residents from the general population (7.24-28.89 ng/g lipid; mean, 15.06 ng/g lipid; median, 14.34 ng/g lipid). The total average PCDD/Fs and PCB TEQ concentration was 20.11 pg/g lipid, averaged over incineration workers (17.73 pg/g lipid) and the general population (21.52 pg/g lipid). In addition, the average total crude concentration of PCDD/Fs was 7.40 ng/g lipids, which was 4.1 times greater than for PBDEs. Congener specific analysis confirmed that BDE 47 was a predictive indicator for total PBDE concentration (correlation coefficient r = 0.912), and that PCB 153 was a predictive indicator for total PCB concentration (r = 0.967). The PBDE levels in human blood in Korea are much higher than those reported in other countries. The presence of the BDE 183 congener was characteristic in the blood of workers from an electronic dismantling facility in MWIs.
12362388	A screening method using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in the single ion monitoring (SIM) mode for the routine congener-specific analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum has been developed and validated. A fast procedure incorporating both liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction was used for clean up and enrichment. Interday and intraday precision and accuracy were assessed for the 12 congeners having dioxin-like activity and PCBs #180 and #170 by analyzing spiked samples on three subsequent days and using (13)C(12)-labelled analogues as internal standards. Furthermore, the relative errors for six non-dioxin-like congeners (PCBs #28, #52, #101, #138, #153 and #180) were measured by using certified reference materials, providing good accuracy at two different concentration levels. The limits of quantification and of detection were 0.5 and 0.2 micro g/L in serum for each congener, respectively. The method allows the chromatographic separation of at least 35 congeners and can therefore be applied to the routine monitoring of the general population for both dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCB congeners.
22334129	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) manufactured in Anniston, Alabama, from 1929 to 1971 caused significant environmental contamination. The Anniston population remains one of the most highly exposed in the world. OBJECTIVES: Reports of increased diabetes in PCB-exposed populations led us to examine possible associations in Anniston residents. METHODS: Volunteers (n = 774) from a cross-sectional study of randomly selected households and adults who completed the Anniston Community Health Survey also underwent measurements of height, weight, fasting glucose, lipid, and PCB congener levels and verification of medications. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the relationships between PCBs and diabetes, adjusting for diabetes risk factors. Participants with prediabetes were excluded from the logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Participants were 47% African American, 70% female, with a mean age of 54.8 years. The prevalence of diabetes was 27% in the study population, corresponding to an estimated prevalence of 16% for Anniston overall; the PCB body burden of 35 major congeners ranged from 0.11 to 170.42 ppb, wet weight. The adjusted OR comparing the prevalence of diabetes in the fifth versus first quintile of serum PCB was 2.78 (95% CI: 1.00, 7.73), with similar associations estimated for second through fourth quintiles. In participants < 55 years of age, the adjusted OR for diabetes for the highest versus lowest quintile was 4.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 20.6), whereas in those ≥ 55 years of age, we observed no significant associations with PCBs. Elevated diabetes prevalence was observed with a 1 SD increase in log PCB levels in women (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.28); a decreased prevalence was observed in men (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.33, 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant associations between elevated PCB levels and diabetes mostly due to associations in women and in individuals < 55 years of age. 
16823400	We analyzed the weighted 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to assess potential differences in mean total 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) TEQ between various groups of individuals and to determine serum reference concentrations for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the general US population. Differences appeared to exist between female smokers and non-smokers and between non-Hispanic groups and all other races. Potential differences were also observed among the four age groups with an increasing trend in mean total TCDD TEQ with increasing age. Both age and gender appeared to confound the association between smoking status and total TCDD TEQ, dictating the need for further analysis. As anticipated, PCBs contributed appreciably to the total TCDD TEQ levels in the referent population and accounted for 38% to 41% of the total TEQ depending on age. Nearly 80% of the mean total TCDD TEQ was attributable to four PCDD/F congeners and three PCB congeners. In this analysis, two methods were used to assess samples where the concentrations were below the limits of detection (LODs), and this did not have significant impact on the mean total TCDD TEQ at the higher percentiles and for older individuals. Comparison of our results to those from a recent PCDD/F biomonitoring study indicates that the mean TCDD TEQ serum concentration of the individuals studied does not appear to be different from typical levels found in the general US population. Additionally, an assessment of data from the National Human Adipose Tissue Survey using our referent statistics shows that levels of these chemicals have been declining in the general population for at least two decades. The reference TEQs presented in this paper provide relevant, current data that can be used to evaluate biomonitoring results of individuals or groups exposed or potentially exposed to PCDD/Fs and PCBs above referent levels.
22150420	In animal studies, exposure to dioxins has been associated with disrupted development of the male reproductive system, including testicular maldescent. Some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also dioxin-like effects. In addition, one previous case-control study has reported an association between congenital cryptorchidism and colostrum PCB levels. We performed a case-control study to evaluate whether congenital cryptorchidism in boys was associated with increased levels of dioxins or PCBs in placenta reflecting foetal exposure. In addition, associations between placenta levels of these chemicals and reproductive hormone levels in boys at 3 months were studied. Placentas were collected in a Danish-Finnish joint prospective cohort study on cryptorchidism (1997-2001). The boys were examined for cryptorchidism at birth and at 3 months. Altogether, 280 placentas [112 Finnish (56 cases, 56 controls) and 168 Danish (39 cases, 129 controls)] were analysed for 17 toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and 37 PCBs (including 12 dioxin-like PCBs). Infant serum samples taken at 3 months were analysed for reproductive hormones. No significant differences between cases and controls were observed in either country in dioxin WHO-TEq levels (median 9.78 vs. 8.47 pg/g fat, respectively, in Finland, and 11.75 vs. 10.88 pg/g fat in Denmark) or PCB WHO-TEq levels (median 2.12 vs. 2.15 pg/g fat in Finland, 2.34 vs. 2.10 pg/g fat in Denmark) or total-TEq levels (median 11.66 vs. 10.58 pg/g fat in Finland, 13.94 vs. 13.00 pg/g fat in Denmark). Placenta WHO-TEq levels of dioxins were not associated with infant reproductive hormone levels at 3 months. In Finland, PCB WHO-TEq levels in placenta associated positively with infant LH levels. WHO-TEq levels of dioxins and PCBs and total-TEq levels were higher in Danish than Finnish samples. In conclusion, no association between placenta levels of dioxins or PCBs and congenital cryptorchidism was found. Significant country differences in chemical levels were observed.
12417482	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) reduce tissue dopamine (DA) concentrations and increase media DA concentrations in both in vitro preparations of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells and adult rat striatal tissue. To determine whether these changes also occur in the intact animal, we used in vivo microdialysis to determine changes in concentrations of DA in striatal dialysates from freely moving adult male rats after exposure to 25 mg/kg/day Aroclor 1254 for varying periods of time. We also determined DA concentrations in striatal tissue obtained postmortem from similarly treated animals. The effects of PCBs on dialysate DA concentrations depended on the length of exposure; DA concentrations were significantly elevated after 3 days of exposure and were significantly reduced after exposure for periods of 1 week or longer. On the other hand, striatal tissue concentrations of DA, determined postmortem in rats exposed to PCBs for the same periods of time, were not significantly altered. We suggest that these time-dependent alterations in dialysate DA concentrations a) reflect PCB-induced alterations of both plasma membrane and vesicular DA transporter function; b) provide a more sensitive index of altered central DA function after exposure to PCBs than does measurement of postmortem tissue DA concentrations; and c) play an important role in mediating some PCB-mediated changes in behavior.
20384379	Human exposure to mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may result in the formation of different profiles of hydroxylated PCBs (HO-PCBs), as a consequence of different exposures or dissimilar metabolism of parent compounds. Therefore, we investigated the levels and profiles of PCBs and HO-PCBs in human serum samples collected from two European countries with different degrees of pollution. There was no significant difference between the levels of sum PCBs measured in each set of samples, with a median concentration of 3100 pg/mL for Romanian samples (n = 53) and 3380 pg/mL for Belgian samples (n = 22). However, the median concentrations recorded for sum HO-PCBs were almost double in Belgian (310 pg/mL) compared to Romanian (175 pg/mL) samples. The detection frequency recorded for HO-PCBs in Belgian samples was also significantly higher compared to Romanian samples. The main contributors to the sum HO-PCBs in the Belgian samples were 4HO-CB107 > 4HO-CB146 > 4HO-CB187 (76% from the sum HO-PCBs) and 4HO-CB187 > 4HO-CB146 > 3'HO-CB138 (66% from the sum of HO-PCBs) in the Romanian samples. The HO-PCB profile showed that the higher chlorinated HO-PCBs had a higher contribution in the Romanian samples compared to the Belgian ones. This suggests that differences in the PCB profiles between populations can lead to the formation of different HO-PCB metabolite profiles presenting thus different risks for populations. No clear preferential mechanism of HO-PCB metabolite formation (HO-direct insertion vs. 1,2-shift of a chlorine atom) could be highlighted for investigated samples. The main chlorinated phenolic compound found in the Belgian samples was pentachlorophenol (PCP) which accounted for up to 85% of the total quantified phenolics, whereas in the Romanian samples, PCP accounted for only 35%.
7850376	Analysis of the kinetics and congener selectivities for PCB metabolism in occupationally exposed workers shows that the lipid PCB concentrations required for the induction of P4502B cytochromes must be > 20 mg/kg; for inducing P4501A and the associated toxic effects, > 600 mg/kg. The observed kinetic behavior indicates that the reported statistical associations between serum PCB levels and certain disease states in the general population (lipid PCBs generally 0-2 mg/kg) probably arise from correlations with the factors that control steady-state xenobiotic levels in human serum (notably, P450 activity and serum lipids) rather than from novel toxic activities of the PCBs.
17023223	An analytical method comprised of automated solid-phase extraction and determination using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (single quadrupole) has been developed for the determination of 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 26 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), two organochlorine compounds (OCs) (hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene) and two brominated phenols (pentabromophenol, and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A)). The analytes were extracted using a sorbent of polystyrene-divinylbenzene and an additional clean-up was performed on a sulphuric acid-silica column to remove lipids. The method has been validated by spiking horse serum at five levels. The mean accuracy given as recovery relative to internal standards was 95%, 99%, 93% and 109% for the PBDEs PCBs, OCs and brominated phenols, respectively. The mean repeatability given as RSDs was respectively 6.9%, 8.7%, 7.5% and 15%. Estimated limits of detection (S/N=3) were in the range 0.2-1.8 pg/g serum for the PBDEs and phenols, and from 0.1 pg/g to 56 pg/g serum for the PCBs and OCs. The validated method has been used to investigate the levels of PBDEs and PCBs in 21 pooled serum samples from the general Norwegian population. In serum from men (age 40-50 years) the sum of seven PBDE congeners (IUPAC No. 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183) increased from 1977 (0.5 ng/g lipids) to 1998 (4.8 ng/g lipids). From 1999 to 2003 the concentration of PBDEs seems to have stabilised. On the other hand, the sum of five PCBs (IUPAC No. 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) in these samples decreased steadily from 1977 (666 ng/g lipids) to 2003 (176 ng/g lipids). Tetrabromobisphenol-A and BDE-209 were detected in almost all samples, but no similar temporal trends to that seen for the PBDEs were observed for these compounds, which might be due to the short half-lives of these brominated flame retardants (FR) in humans.
8433185	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) continue to be of great environmental and occupational health interest. This review summarizes the major clinical findings reported in individuals incurring the greatest PCB exposure--those persons working in the manufacture or repair of electrical capacitors or transformers. The potential target organs addressed in the studies reviewed include the liver, lungs, skin, cardiovascular system, nervous system, certain endocrine systems, the blood/immune system, and the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. After careful analysis, the weight of evidence suggests the only adverse health effects attributable to high, occupational PCB exposures are dermal. This review confirms and extends the observations of others, ie, that the collective occupational experience with PCB fluids provides no evidence for adverse PCB effects on any other organ systems.
21684540	BACKGROUND: Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organochlorine compounds bioaccumulating in human tissues. Body burden of organochlorines may be influenced by individual characteristics such as age, weight variations, breastfeeding, dietary habits and place of residence. OBJECTIVES: To assess the current serum concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), the main DDT breakdown product, and of PCBs in women from two French administrative areas (Ille-et-Vilaine and Côte d'Or). To identify determinants of the current serum levels among individual characteristics related to intake, metabolism, and excretion of organochlorines. METHODS: We measured serum p,p'-DDE and PCB levels in 1055 general population women who were recruited in 2005-2007 to serve as controls in a case-control study on breast cancer. Associations between organochlorine levels and age, current body mass index (BMI), BMI change during the last 10 years, dietary habits, breastfeeding history, residence area and education were assessed in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Median concentrations of p,p'-DDE and total PCBs were 85 and 240ng/g lipid, respectively. Based on multivariate analyses, the main predictors of high p,p'-DDE levels included age and frequent consumption of saltwater fish in women below 50 years, and high BMI in older women. Total PCB levels increased markedly with age. Among older women, other important predictors of high PCB levels included frequent consumption of saltwater fish and low BMI. Our results are also suggestive of an inverse association between PCB levels and BMI gain during the last ten years. Women in Côte d'Or had significantly higher PCB levels than women in Ille-et-Vilaine. CONCLUSION: The patterns of associations between determinants and serum organochlorine concentrations suggest that human PCB contamination is still ongoing in France. The most important predictors of serum p,p'-DDE and PCB concentrations among French women include age, body mass index, dietary habits, and place of residence. 
18288320	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may accelerate the cognitive and motor dysfunction found in normal aging, but few studies have examined these outcomes and PCB exposure among older adults. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated neuropsychological status and low-level PCB exposure among older adults living along contaminated portions of the upper Hudson River in New York. METHODS: A total of 253 persons between 55 and 74 years of age were recruited and interviewed, and provided blood samples for congener-specific PCB analysis. Participants also underwent a neuropsychological battery consisting of 34 tests capable of detecting subtle deficits in cognition, motor function, affective state, and olfactory function. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, the results indicated that an increase in serum total PCB concentration from 250 to 500 ppb (lipid basis) was associated with a 6.2% decrease in verbal learning, as measured by California Verbal Learning Test trial 1 score (p = 0.035), and with a 19.2% increase in depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that exposure to PCBs may be associated with some measures of memory and learning and depression among adults 55-74 years of age whose current body burdens are similar to those of the general population. Although the results are useful in delineating the neuropsychological effects of low-level exposure to PCBs, further studies of whether older men and women are a sensitive subpopulation are needed. 
15289166	Human hair as a biologic measure of exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has some advantages over the more commonly used blood and adipose tissue samples. However, one of the primary limitations is the difficulty in distinguishing between exogenous and endogenous contamination. In addition, there are currently no standardized methods for hair sample collection, washing, and chemical analysis. There is also very limited information describing the correlation between levels of organic contaminants in hair and other body compartments. To explore levels of POPs in blood and hair, samples from 10 volunteers were collected and analyzed for select organochlorine pesticides and 57 individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. We demonstrated that the method for analyzing organic contaminants in human hair was reliable and reproducible. Washing hair with shampoo decreased levels of PCBs, pesticides, and lipids by 25-33% on average and up to 62% for low-chlorinated congeners. The percentage of lipids and the levels of organochlorines in hair were higher than in serum. We found strong correlation (r = 0.8) between p,p -DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) levels in hair and blood and moderate correlations for the more persistent PCB congeners, but no correlations or weak correlations for other organochlorines. The present study provides preliminary evidence on the utility of hair analysis for POPs; however, further larger studies are recommended before hair analysis can be successfully applied in epidemiologic studies on POPs.
8144231	The association between blood polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentration and serum triglyceride level was investigated in 259 "Yusho" patients (PCB poisoning) who underwent health examinations for Yusho in 1988. Geometric means of PCB and triglyceride were 3.84 ppb (95% confidence interval: 3.54-4.17) and 114.3 mg/dl (106.6-122.6), respectively. Both correlation and multiple regression analyses showed a weak but statistically significant correlation between these two variables. The mean triglyceride level adjusted for age and sex was then calculated for comparison among four PCB levels, using analysis of covariance. This indicated a progressive increase with increasing PCB: 98.36, 117.78, 117.84, and 127.65 mg/dl at < 2.7, 2.7+, 4.1+, and 6.1+ ppb, respectively (F = 2.01, P = 0.113). Comparing PCB levels, the difference in adjusted mean triglyceride levels was marginally significant between the first and second (P = 0.088), and the first and third quartiles (P = 0.066), and reached significance between the first and fourth quartiles (P = 0.021). Thus, a weak but significant association between blood PCB and serum triglyceride was observed in the patients 20 years after exposure, although their blood PCB and serum triglyceride were relatively close to the normal levels.
20455569	Blood plasma samples (n = 43) collected retrospectively from New York State employees and National Guard personnel who had been assigned to work in the vicinity of the World Trade Center (WTC) during the week after the collapse of the buildings were analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs). On the basis of algorithms developed to rank individual exposures to dust and debris and to smoke, we categorized the samples as: more smoke exposure (MSE), more dust exposure (MDE), less smoke exposure (LSE), and less dust exposure (LDE). Mean concentrations of PCDDs were 1070, 223, 3690, and 732 pg/g lipid wt, and mean concentrations of PCDFs were 910, 1520, 230, and 117 pg/g lipid wt, for the MSE, MDE, LSE, and LDE groups, respectively. The concentrations of PCDFs were higher in the two "more exposure" groups than in the two "less exposure" groups. Calculated TEQ concentrations of coplanar PCBs and PCDD/Fs in plasma samples were, on average, 1.12 and 41.2 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid wt, respectively. TEQ concentrations of PCDFs were higher than those of PCDDs in both "more exposure" groups but lower than those of PCDDs in "less exposure" groups. This result is suggestive of exposure of the WTC responders to PCDFs after the WTC collapse. PCDFs contributed the majority of TEQs and are therefore the critical dioxin-like compounds in MSE/MDE groups, whereas PCDDs are the critical compounds in the LSE/LDE groups.
11543949	Several reports have indicated that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) altered development of biogenic amine systems in the brain, impaired behavioral performances, and disrupted maturation of the thyroid axis. The current study examines whether these developmental effects of PCB are correlated. Timed-pregnant Long-Evans rats were gavaged with the PCB mixture Aroclor 1016 (A-1016, 10 mg/kg) from gestation day (GD) 6 to parturition. Some pups continued to receive daily oral administration of PCB (10 mg/kg) until weaning at postnatal day (PD) 21. Another group of pregnant rats was given Aroclor 1254 (A-1254, 8 mg/kg) daily from GD 6 to weaning. At various age intervals, rats were sacrificed and six brain regions (prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, diencephalon, cerebellum, midbrain + brain stem) were removed and analyzed for dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, transmitter turnover rates were determined after an acute treatment of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. Serum samples were collected and analyzed for triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) by radioimmunoassay. Behaviorally, rats were evaluated for spatial learning and memory by means of T-maze delayed alternation and Morris maze tasks on PD 23 and PD 70, respectively. A-1016 treatment produced only small and transient reductions in body weight gain, and generally did not alter the thyroid status of the developing rats. It did not cause any significant changes in DA or NE level, or turnover rate in any of the brain regions examined, nor did it affect behavioral measures of cognitive development. In contrast, perinatal exposure to A-1254 led to marked deficits of growth, and sharply reduced serum T(4), although T(3) remained largely unaffected. Accompanying this hormonal imbalance, brain NE contents in the A-1254-exposed pups were reduced, although brain DA was not significantly affected; no demonstrable neurobehavioral deficits were seen in the T-maze or Morris maze tests. These results indicated that development of central noradrenergic neurons was compromised by perinatal exposure to A-1254 but not A-1016, and both PCB mixtures failed to alter behavioral performances.
18426515	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were widely used for industrial purposes and consumer products, but because of their toxicity, production was banned by most industrialised countries in the late 1970s. In eastern Slovakia, they were produced until 1985. During 2002-04, a birth cohort of mothers (n = 1057) residing in two Slovak districts was enrolled at delivery, and their specimens and information were collected after birth. Congeners of PCBs were measured in maternal serum by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. In this study, we used multiple linear regression to examine the effects of prenatal PCB exposure on birthweight adjusted for gestational age, controlling for inter-pregnancy interval, and maternal smoking, age, education, ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index and height. The association between total maternal serum PCB levels and birthweight was not statistically significant. However, an interaction model indicated that maternal PCB concentrations were associated with lower birthweight in Romani boys. Based on the fitted regression model, the predicted birthweight of Romani boys at the 90th percentile of maternal PCBs (12.8 ng/mL) was 133 g lower than the predicted birthweight at the 10th percentile of maternal PCBs (1.6 ng/mL). This is a similar magnitude of effect to that observed for maternal smoking and birthweight. These results suggest that higher levels of PCBs in maternal blood sera may inhibit growth in boys, particularly in those already affected by social factors related to ethnicity. This study is consistent with previous findings that boys are more susceptible than girls to growth restriction induced by in utero organochlorine exposures, and further indicates that high PCBs may magnify the influence of social disadvantage in this vulnerable group of boys.
20384378	Human exposure to individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and dichloro-diphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) through food (duplicate diets) and indoor dust ingestion was assessed for 19 Belgian students. The serum concentrations of the persistent PCB congeners in serum (PCB 118, 138, 153, 170, and 180) have been correlated with the individual intake through food and dust. Dietary intakes of SigmaPCBs ranged between 40 and 204 ng/day (median 133). PCB exposure through dust ingestion ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ng/day (median 0.3) or 0.3 and 1.7 ng/day (median 0.8), assuming average dust ingestion (20 mg/day) and high dust ingestion rates (50 mg/day), respectively. Dietary intake of p,p'-DDE was comparable to that of PCBs with a range from 21 to 214 ng/day (median 92). The exposure to p,p'-DDE via dust ingestion ranged between 0.02 and 0.43 ng/day (median 0.17) or 0.05 and 1.09 ng/day (median 0.43), assuming average and high dust ingestion rates, respectively. Concentrations measured in blood serum were 28-153 ng/g lipid weight (lw) (median 74) and 32-264 ng/g lw (median 45) for SigmaPCBs and p,p'-DDE, respectively. Serum concentrations in the studied population are slightly lower compared to other European populations. In spite of the uncertainty associated with the dust ingestion rates, food was the predominant exposure pathway for each PCB congener and for p,p'-DDE in the studied population. Food intake contributed more than 99% of the combined PCB intake from food and dust. No significant positive correlations (p > 0.05) were observed between the serum concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE and the total intake through food and dust for each participant. Instead, it is hypothesized that past and episodic higher current intakes are more important determinants of body burden than continuous background exposures at low levels.
17537484	We examined 2,046 adults (834 males and 1,212 females aged 20-75 years) from polluted district in East Slovakia (POLL) and two neighboring upstream and upwind located districts of background pollution (BCGR). By ultrasound we estimated the thyroid volume (ThV), hypoechogenicity (HYE), nodules and cysts. Serum levels of thyrotropin (TSH), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) and thyroglobulin were estimated by electrochemiluminiscent assay and these of 15 PCB congeners, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and hexachlorocyclohexane by high-resolution gas chromatography. In 320 subjects also selected hydroxylated and methylsulfonated PCB metabolites, polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs), -furans (PCDFs), five dioxin-like coplanar and eight mono-ortho PCB congeners were estimated. Urinary iodine was measured by automatic microplate method. Reciprocal positive association was found between three major POPs (PCBs, DDE and HCB), the levels of these and also PCDDs plus PCDFs in polluted area being considerably higher than in background pollution area. ThV in groups of males and females from POLL with high PCBs level was significantly higher (p<0.001 by t-test) then in age and sex matched groups from BCGR with low PCBs level. In 1,048 males and females aged <60 years with serum PCBs level >1,000 ng g(-1) lipid (median=1,756 ng g(-1)) a significant effect of age on ThV was found (p<0.01 by ANOVA), while in 921 respective subjects with PCBs level <1,000 ng g(-1) (median=661 ng g(-1)) it was not. These findings supported the view on the additional effect of PCBs on ThV other than that of age. Since the urinary iodine in both districts showed optimal range, any interfering effect of unsatisfactory iodine intake on ThV may be excluded. The frequency of autoimmune thyroiditis signs such as HYE, increased serum level of TPOab and TSH resulting in subclinical or overt thyroid hypofunction was positively associated with sex, age and organochlorine levels. The increase of such frequency in males with POPs levels was much more abrupt than that in females. No considerable differences in the frequency of thyroid nodules as related to PCBs level were found.
12162858	1. After an oral dose of (14)C-labelled 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (CB-77), the conventional germ-free and bile-duct cannulated male Sprague-Dawley rat excreted approximately 80% of the dose in faeces and/or bile within 3 days. 2. For the germ-free and conventional rat, 15% of the dose was excreted via the faeces as metabolites covalently bound to lipids. Bile-duct-cannulated rats excreted similar amounts of lipid-bound metabolites in the bile. The lipid-bound metabolites appear to be formed in the liver and excreted via the bile, and the microflora did not seem essential for the formation of lipid-bound metabolites. 3. The novel CB-77 metabolites had chemical and physical properties similar to those of lipids with regard to solubility and polarity, as determined by partition characteristics on various chromatographic systems. 4. In addition to identification of hydroxylated CB-77 metabolites, several fatty acid esters of hydroxy-chlorobiphenyls were indicated and one hydroxy-tetrachlorobiphenylol palmitoate was identified, but fatty acid esters were minor metabolites. 5. Approximately 70% of the lipid-bound metabolites were present in the fraction that contained phospholipids. The formation of lipid-bound CB-77 metabolites seems a spontaneous reaction rather than an enzymatically catalysed reaction, as indicated by the large number of different lipid-bound metabolites.
22001220	No nationwide study has ever measured polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and organochlorine pesticide (OCP) body burden in Canadians aged 65 years and over. The objective of this study was to determine plasma concentrations of PCB congeners and OCPs in participants from a sub-cohort of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging and to examine the effects of socio-demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics on selected organochlorine concentrations. Archived plasma samples collected from 2023 subjects were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using negative chemical ionization for 15 PCB congeners and 11 OCPs. Descriptive statistics were used to report PCB congeners and OCP plasma concentrations. Multivariate models were used to study whether age at blood collection, sex, education, body mass index, rural residence, geographic region, smoking status and alcohol intake influences PCB 153, the most abundant congener, and the major OCP (beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor, p,p'-DDE) plasma concentrations. Statistical analyses were restricted to 1979 subjects and 17 organochlorine compounds for which at least 50% of the samples had concentrations above the limit of detection. Of these, 775 were men (mean age: 82.2 years) and 1204 were women (mean age: 84.6 years). The median concentrations (ng/g lipid) of PCB 153 in the plasma of men and women were 70.9 and 75.4, respectively. The levels of the sum of PCBs and the sum of dioxin-like PCBs were 276 and 31.3 for men, and 300 and 45.5 for women, respectively. The median concentrations (ng/g lipid) of p,p'-DDE, the most abundant OCP, were 565 for men and 828 for women. All compounds were positively and significantly intercorrelated (rs=0.39-0.99; p<0.001). Except for trans-nonachlor, the multivariate models revealed that age and male sex were the determining characteristics that showed, respectively, strongly positive and negative associations with selected organochlorine concentrations. These plasma concentrations from a large population based study can be considered as baseline data for body burdens of older Canadians.
12204824	In the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic, the traditional diet includes pilot whale meat and blubber and other marine food. Fatty fish and blubber of mammals may contain high concentrations of organohalogen substances (OHSs). Elevated levels of OHSs have been reported from the Faroe Islands, first documented in breast milk samples obtained in 1987. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples from pregnant Faroese women known to differ in their dietary habits. High concentrations of OH-PCBs and PCBs were found in part of the human serum samples analyzed, and the relative OH-PCB and PCB congener distributions were similar to those observed elsewhere. There was a wide span between the lowest and highest OH-PCB and PCB concentrations in the serum samples analyzed, with ranges of 19-1,800 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and 150-22,000 ng/g lw, respectively. The ratio of sigmaOH-PCB/sigmaPCB averaged about 10% and varied little. 4-Hydroxy-2,2,3,4,5,5,6-heptachlorobiphenyl was the most abundant OH-PCB metabolite in all samples analyzed, with four other OH-PCB congeners as dominating metabolites in the serum. More than 25 additional OH-PCBs were indicated. This study confirms the presence of high concentrations of organohalogen substances in populations or areas far removed from their sources.
18614165	The concentrations of dichlorodiphenytrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), dieldrin, and 20 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in 237 human breast milk samples collected from 12 locations in Tunisia. Gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was used to identify and quantify residue levels on a lipid basis of organochlorine compounds (OCs). The predominant OCs in human breast milk were PCBs, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, HCHs, and HCB. Concentrations of DDTs in human breast milk from rural areas were significantly higher than those from urban locations (p<0.05). With regard to PCBs, we observed the predominance of mid-chlorinated congeners due to the presence of PCBs with high K(ow) such as PCB 153, 138, and 180. Positive correlations were found between concentrations of OCs in human breast milk and age of mothers and number of parities, suggesting the influence of such factors on OC burdens in lactating mothers. The comparison of daily intakes of PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, and HCB to infants through human breast milk with guidelines proposed by WHO and Health Canada shows that some individuals accumulated OCs in breast milk close to or higher than these guidelines.
12012187	The chemicals endosulfan-alpha, endosulfan-beta, endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan ether, endosulfan lactone, PCB-21, PCB-48, PCB-61, and PCB-136 have been determined in 100 serum samples from women living in agricultural areas of Almería (Spain). The study includes a surgically treated breast cancer patient and a matching group of women with no sign of estrogenic-dependent disease. The determination was performed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS-MS). Recovery, precision, linear range, detection limit (LOD), and quantification limit (LOQ) were calculated for each pesticide as was the expanded uncertainty (U). The method was evaluated for our laboratory and could be applied to subsequent results with relevant quality-control data. Comparison of the results was performed. The advantage of MS-MS over ECD for determination of endocrine-disrupting compounds in complex matrices is presented. The most commonly encountered pesticide was endosulfan-alpha. Endosulfan-beta and the PCB-48 congener were detected at concentrations lower than their LOQ. Endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan ether, endosulfan lactone, PCB-21, PCB-61 and PCB-136 were not found in any of the serum samples analysed.
16765419	In an attempt to evaluate the background levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho, mono-ortho and indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in people living in an urban (Athens) and a rural (Kozani) area of Greece, blood serum and mother milk samples were analyzed. Analytical results are reported in this study. Statistically significantly differences were observed between regions, sexes and ages. Contamination levels in blood and human milk from Greece reported here are low compared to the previously reported dioxin data from other European countries and give no indication of particular health risk.
15006510	Concentrations of 23 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-DDT and two of its metabolites, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-TDE have been measured in serum samples of up to 1 ml of Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) gathered from five populations in Spain. SigmaPCB concentrations were found to be in the range 3.2-97 ng/ml, while those of SigmaDDTs ranged from 0.93 to 38 ng/ml. p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE ratios higher than one were only found in the Segovia population, which could be an indication of recent use of p,p'-DDT in the area. In all cases, PCB profiles were dominated by congeners 52, 132 + 105, 138, 153 and 180. However, some differences among the five populations studied became evident when their profiles were compared with those of technical PCB mixtures by principal components analysis. The DDT and PCB levels detected in the serums analysed were lower than those previously reported for similar avian species and those reported to have deleterious effects on survival or reproduction of birds.
12661184	This analysis represents a 5-year update of our mortality study of 7075 PCB exposed capacitor workers that now includes 1654 deaths and 235,984 person-years of observation with follow-up through 1998. In hourly males and females the observed number of deaths from all-cancers and all-causes were similar to the expected numbers. In salaried males all-cause and all-cancer mortality were significantly below the expected. In salaried females, all-cause mortality was significantly below the expected and all-cancer mortality was below the expected, but not significantly. We again failed to find any significant excess mortality in the a priori cancers of concern or in any other cancers in the total cohort or in the highly exposed portion of the cohort. These results expand on our previous observations and as before the data fail to demonstrate any causal association between occupational PCB exposure and excess cancer mortality or any other causes of death.
23044514	Evidence suggests possible Parkinson's disease (PD)-relevant neural effects of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Limited epidemiological evidence suggests that polychlorinated biphenyl exposure may increase PD risk, but no studies have involved biomarkers of polychlorinated biphenyl exposure before PD onset. We examined the prospective association between serum polychlorinated biphenyls and PD. We conducted a nested case-control study within the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey with serum samples collected during 1968-1972 and analyzed in 2005-2007 for polychlorinated biphenyls. Incident PD cases were identified through the Social Insurance Institution's registry and were confirmed by medical record review (n = 101). Controls (n = 349) were matched on age, sex, municipality, and vital status. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios. There was no evidence of increasing risk of PD with increasing polychlorinated biphenyl exposure in adjusted analyses. Instead, there was a trend toward lower odds of PD with increasing serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations, which was most pronounced for the sum of all measured polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and the sum of dioxin-like congeners. Compared with that of those in the lowest quintile, the odds ratio of PD among those in the highest quintile of total polychlorinated biphenyls was 0.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.70; P trend = .02) and for dioxin-like congeners was 0.34 (95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.90; P trend = .05). These results do not support an increased risk of PD from polychlorinated biphenyl exposure and instead suggest a possible protective effect of polychlorinated biphenyl exposure.
19850319	We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and non-dioxin-like PCBs in paired samples of blood and breast milk collected from 89 primiparous mothers in Sapporo City, Japan, and studied the relationships of these compounds between blood and breast milk for these women plus 30 primiparous mothers in whom these data had been previously reported. The present study is one of the few studies in which the concentration distributions of PCDDs, PCDFs, dioxin-like PCBs, and non-dioxin-like PCBs have been investigated in blood and breast milk collected from the same mothers. The arithmetic mean TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of these 119 subjects were 8.2, 2.9, 5.1, and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1)lipid, respectively, and 4.8, 2.0, 4.0, and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1)lipid, respectively, with the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds being 7.0-36 (mean: 17, median: 14) and 5.7-41 (mean: 11, median: 10) pg TEQ g(-1)lipid, respectively. The sums of the concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners that were measured in the subjects' blood and breast milk were 43-445 (mean: 120, median: 106) and 34-366 (mean: 90, median: 81) ng g(-1)lipid, respectively, indicating that the total TEQ concentration and the total concentration of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the maternal blood were notably higher than those in the breast milk. Statistically significant correlations were observed between maternal age and the total TEQ concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs or the total concentration of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in maternal blood, and significant correlations were also observed between maternal age and the total TEQ concentration of these dioxin-like compounds or the total concentration of 56 PCB congeners in breast milk. The total TEQ concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs in maternal blood showed a close correlation to that in subjects' breast milk, and there was also good correlation between the total concentration of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in maternal blood and that in subjects' breast milk. Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses showed a relationship between the total TEQ concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs and the total concentration of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in maternal blood, and also showed an association between the total TEQ concentration of these dioxin-like compounds and the total concentration of 56 PCB congeners in breast milk. The concentration of hexaCB-153 in maternal blood showed significant correlations to the total TEQ concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs or the total concentration of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs in that sample. Moreover, the concentration of hexaCB-153 in breast milk also showed significant correlations to the total TEQ concentration of these dioxin-like compounds or the total concentration of 56 PCB congeners in that sample. These findings suggested that hexaCB-153 may be an indicator of total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs and total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in blood and breast milk of primiparous mothers.
20104234	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To assess biomarkers and frequency questions as measures of fish consumption. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants in the Fishermen substudy numbered 125 men and 139 women (aged 22-74), and in the Health 2000 substudy, 577 men and 712 women (aged 45-74) participated. The aim of the Fishermen study was to examine the overall health effect of fish consumption in a high-consumption population, whereas the aim of the Health 2000 substudy was to obtain in-depth information on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Fish consumption was measured by the same validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in both the studies, with a further two separate frequency questions used in the Fishermen substudy. Dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and methyl mercury (MeHg) (in the Fishermen substudy alone), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) (in both studies) were analyzed from fasting serum/blood samples. RESULTS: The Spearman's correlation coefficients between FFQ fish consumption and dioxins, PCBs, MeHg and omega-3 PUFAs were respectively 0.46, 0.48, 0.43 and 0.38 among the Fishermen substudy men, and 0.28, 0.36, 0.45 and 0.31 among women. Similar correlation coefficients were observed between FFQ fish consumption and serum omega-3 PUFAs in the Health 2000 substudy, and also between FFQ fish consumption and the frequency questions on fish consumption in the Fishermen substudy. According to multiple regression modeling and LMG metrics, the most important fish consumption biomarkers were dioxins and PCBs among the men and MeHg among the women. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental contaminants seemed to be slightly better fish consumption biomarkers than omega-3 PUFAs in the Baltic Sea area. The separate frequency questions measured fish consumption equally well when compared with the FFQ. 
16942395	BACKGROUND: Developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been implicated as a possible cause of deficient immune function in children. This study was designed to assess whether prenatal and postnatal exposure to PCBs impacts on antibody response to childhood immunizations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two birth cohorts were formed in the Faroe Islands, where exposures vary widely, because traditional diets may include whale blubber contaminated with PCBs. Prenatal exposure was determined from maternal concentrations of PCBs in pregnancy serum and milk. Following routine childhood vaccinations against tetanus and diphtheria, 119 children were examined at 18 mo and 129 children at 7 y of age, and their serum samples were analyzed for tetanus and diphtheria toxoid antibodies and for PCBs. The antibody response to diphtheria toxoid decreased at age 18 mo by 24.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-41.9; p = 0.04) for each doubling of the cumulative PCB exposure at the time of examination. The diphtheria response was lower at age 7 y and was not associated with the exposure. However, the tetanus toxoid antibody response was affected mainly at age 7 y, decreasing by 16.5% (95% CI, 1.51-29.3; p = 0.03) for each doubling of the prenatal exposure. Structural equation analysis showed that the early postnatal exposure was the most important predictor of a decreased vaccination response. CONCLUSIONS: Increased perinatal exposure to PCBs may adversely impact on immune responses to childhood vaccinations. The clinical implications of insufficient antibody production emphasize the need for prevention of immunotoxicant exposures. 
7581897	A method was developed for the transfer of fat, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), naphthalenes (PCNs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) from blood plasma into the lipophilic gel Lipidex 5000. Subsequent elution of the gel separated about 70% of the fat from the analytes. Different adsorbents and activated charcoal were applied for further purification of the sample and separation of analytes. Identification and determination of the chlorinated compounds were made by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection (GC-ECD) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Recoveries were studied by addition of Halowax 1014 and different congeners of PCBs, PCNs, PCDDs and PCDFs to 50 ml of plasma. The mean recoveries of the individual compounds studied were 72-99%. By using the liquid-gel partitioning technique emulsions were avoided. Concentrations of lipids in plasma obtained by the present method agreed well with the concentrations obtained using liquid-liquid partitioning with chloroform-methanol.
12842782	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are food-chain contaminants that have been shown to induce adverse developmental effects in humans. In the course of an epidemiologic study established to investigate neurodevelopmental deficits induced by environmental PCB exposure in the Inuit population of northern Québec (Nunavik, Canada), we compared three biomarkers of prenatal exposure and models to predict PCB plasma concentration at 6 months postpartum. Concentrations of 14 PCB congeners were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection in lipids extracted from maternal plasma, cord plasma, breast milk (collected at approximately 1 month postpartum), and 6-month-old infant plasma samples. Similar congener profiles were observed in all biologic samples, and PCB-153, the most abundant and persistent PCB congener, was strongly correlated with other frequently detected PCB congeners in all biologic media. When expressed on a lipid basis, maternal plasma, cord plasma, and milk concentrations of this congener were strongly intercorrelated, indicating that PCB concentration in any of these biologic media is a good indicator of prenatal exposure to PCBs. A multivariate model that included maternal PCB-153 plasma lipid concentration, breast-feeding duration, and the sum of two skin-fold thicknesses (an index of infant body fat mass) explained 72% of PCB-153 plasma concentration variance at 6 months postpartum (p < 0.001). By contrast, based on the product of breast-feeding duration times the concentration of PCBs in plasma lipids, which was used as an index of postnatal PCB exposure in several studies, only 36% of infant plasma concentration was explained.
18831733	BACKGROUND: The Yusho poisoning incident, which was caused by rice bran oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated quarterphenyls (PCQs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) generated by heat denaturation of PCB, occurred in 1968 in western Japan. Annual physical, dermatological, dental, ophthalmological and laboratory examinations were conducted for Yusho patients after the incident. From 2001, blood levels of individual PCDF congeners were also measured. The blood levels of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF), PCBs and PCQs in Yusho patients were found to be significantly higher than those of the general population. We investigated the relationships between blood concentrations of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCBs and PCQs in Yusho patients and the items measured in the annual medical examination. METHODS: Medical and laboratory examination data from 501 Yusho patients enrolled in the study from 2001 to 2004 were analyzed. The relationships between blood 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB and PCQ concentrations and medical/laboratory examination data were investigated using principal components and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Serum Concentrations of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCBs and PCQs in blood tended to correlate with either acneform eruptions, black comedones, cutaneous and mucosal pigmentation, and hypersecretion of meibomian glands as well as general fatigue, headaches, cough/sputum, abdominal pain, arthralgia, increased blood sugar, increased serum gamma-GTP and decreased total bilirubin. The majority of these signs and symptoms are included in the diagnostic criteria for Yusho. CONCLUSION: After Yusho patients had suffered chronic exposure to these chlorinated compounds for more than 35 years, the serum concentration of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF in blood was significantly related to arthralgia and decreased albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio; the serum concentration of PCBs was significantly related to ophthalmologic symptoms; and the serum concentration of PCQ to increased total cholesterol. These findings suggest that the co-contaminants may affect other functions than those originally associated with Yusho. 
14527849	The present study reports the association between prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the corpus callosum, and response inhibition in children who are 4.5 years old. Children (n = 189) enrolled in the Oswego study were tested using a continuous performance test. We measured (square millimeters) the splenium of the corpus callosum, a pathway implicated in the regulation of response inhibition, using magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated a dose-dependent association between cord blood PCBs and errors of commission. Splenium size but not other brain areas predicted errors of commission (r(2) = 0.20), with smaller size associated with more errors of commission. There was an interaction between splenium size and PCB exposure. The smaller the splenium, the larger the association between PCBs and errors of commission. If the association between PCBs and response inhibition is indeed causal, then children with suboptimal development of the splenium are particularly vulnerable to these effects. These data await replication.
16987543	We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (non-ortho PCBs) and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (mono-ortho PCBs) in blood collected from 279 Yusho patients living in Japan, 92 Yusho-suspected persons living in Japan and 127 normal controls living in Fukuoka Prefecture, and compared among the groups in terms the concentrations of these compounds. The total toxic equivalents (TEQ) concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in the bloods of Yusho patients and Yusho-suspected persons were 161.4 and 51.2 pg TEQ/g lipid, respectively and were about 3.5 and 1.1 times higher than those of normal controls, respectively. Although the TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs among Yusho patients, Yusho-suspected persons and normal controls were nearly the same, the PCDFs levels of Yusho patients were significantly higher than those of Yusho-suspected persons and about 10.3 times higher than those of normal controls. In Yusho patients, PCDFs contributed about 65% to the total TEQ concentration. Among the PCDFs congeners for Yusho patients, the concentration of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) was about 11.3 times higher than that of normal controls. These findings indicated that Yusho patients even now, more than 34 years after the outbreak of Yusho, have much higher blood levels of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF in general than do unaffected persons.
7780723	A new congener specific method has been developed for extraction and quantitative determination of PCB contaminants of serum. After liquid-liquid extraction and chromatographic fractionation with Carbopack-C/florisil column, the analytes were identified and quantified utilizing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MSD) using selected ion monitoring (SIM) technique. Recoveries of 35 non-planar PCB congeners (#18, 28, 31, 44, 49, 52, 60, 66, 74, 82, 87, 99, 101, 105, 110, 114, 118, 128, 138, 141, 146, 151, 153, 156, 157, 158, 167, 170, 171, 180, 183, 185, 187, 189 and 194) and 5 non-ortho (coplanar) congeners (#37, 77, 81, 126 and 169) from spiked serum were between 55-115%.
9399126	A methodology is presented for the routine determination of specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in serum and milk samples. The procedures include standardized extraction, cleanup and quantitation by high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and comprehensive quality assurance program to minimize systematic and erratic errors. The analyses of 68 PCB congeners and three pesticides, p,p1-dichloro diphenyl dichloro ethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and Mirex, at part-per-billion levels include the addition of surrogate congener standards (IUPAC isomers #46 and #142), extraction with hexane after protein precipitation, cleanup with Florisil, and analysis by GC with capillary column and electron capture detection. Quantitation is based on calibration standards and response factors using isomers #30 and #204 as internal standards. The quality control activities consist of analyses of samples in batches of 6 to 10 simultaneously with quality control (QC) samples. The quality assurance program checks that the procedures are under control by the use of control charts and set the criteria for data acceptability. The detection limits for the congeners and pesticides associated with the analyses of 500 serum samples and of 100 milk samples are reported. In addition, typical profiles of congener distribution in both matrices are illustrated.
10972996	A sensitive, selective and reliable procedure was developed and validated to determine organochlorinated compounds, which have endocrine-disrupting effects, in human serum. Target compounds were selected between polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorinated pesticides. Sample workup consisted of (1) extraction of serum with organic solvents, (2) clean-up of the organic extract using acid treatment with H(2)SO(4), (3) elution of the cleaned-up extract through a liquid column chromatographic system and (4) analysis of the fraction eluted by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (ECD) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection. Performance characteristics, such as linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy and recovery, of both chromatographic methods were studied. The proposed analytical methodology was applied to determine the target compounds in serum samples from women living in agricultural areas of Almería (Spain). The results show the advantage of MS/MS over ECD in the analysis of real human serum samples where matrix interferences can be confused with target pesticides.
17207843	In 2003, concentrations of altogether 17 PCDD/Fs congeners and 12 non-ortho and mono-ortho dioxin-like PCBs were measured in the blood of 60 randomly selected adults who lived in three settlements surrounding a chemical plant that had been producing chlorinated herbicides (mainly HCHs, HCB, pentachlorophenole, 2,4,5-T) in the 1960's; subjects consuming home-produced animal foods were chosen. Twenty blood donors with similar characteristics from the locality with about 80 km distance were used as control subjects. The factors that influenced the dioxin levels were investigated on the basis of a questionnaire. The aim of our study was to find out whether the residents living in the surroundings of the chemical plant are at a greater exposure risk than the controls. To calculate TEQ values, WHO-TEFs were used. The concentrations of four PCDD and six PCDF congeners were below the LOD in more than 50% of samples. Significantly higher WHO-TEQ levels (p<0.05) were found for PCDDs, PCDFs, or PCBs in all three followed up groups compared with controls. The geometric means of the total TEQ values for PCDD/F/PCBs were 43.8, 50.2, and 40.0 pg/g fat compared to 23.2 pg/g fat in the control. The percentages of TEQ due to the measured congeners in exposed groups were 9-10.3% for PCDDs, 20.5-26.9% for PCDFs, 19.2-23.1% for coplanar and 43.6-47.2% for mono-ortho PCBs. In control, the percentage of TEQ was 11.6, 26.7, 24.1, and 37.5%. PCBs, predominantly PCB156, followed by PCB126 contributed 60 to 70% of the total TEQ value. Positive correlation of the PCDD/PCDF/PCB blood levels with age and with consumption of locally produced eggs was found.
12670000	A method for the determination of seven polychlorinated biphenyl residues in plasma by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed. The analytes were isolated from human plasma by liquid-liquid extraction, followed by solid-phase extraction, and separation on an HP5 Trace column. Ionization mode was electronic impact, and selected ion storage was used for isolation and quantitation of the compounds. The method was evaluated for its analytical performances and therefore applied to monitor the prevalence of these seven polychlorinated biphenyl residues in a female population. Eighty samples were analyzed, and 82.5% presented detectable amounts of at least one residue. For the population study, results were reported on a lipid-adjusted basis. Because the proposed method is satisfying and seems to be suitable for the quantitation of PCB congeners in a general population, epidemiological studies to evaluate the widespread contamination with these environmental compounds can be proposed.
11013405	It is known that lower-chlorinated biphenyls are metabolically activated to electrophilic quinoid species capable of binding to DNA. Also, certain metabolites are capable of redox cycling, thereby increasing oxidative stress in biological systems. In the present study, we tested mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and heptachlorinated biphenyls for their ability to bind with DNA and to induce oxidative DNA damage. We present additional evidence that several PCB congeners form DNA adducts after metabolic activation, which can be detected by the nuclease P1- or butanol-enrichment procedures of the (32)P-postlabeling technique. Butanol and nuclease P1 enrichments showed different adduct recoveries, depending on the level of chlorination of the biphenyls. Application of the nuclease P1 enrichment showed that the incubation of 2-chloro-; 3, 4-dichloro-; 2,4,4'-trichloro-; 3,4,5-trichloro-; and 2,2',5, 5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl with calf thymus DNA and liver microsomes from rats treated with phenobarbital, followed by oxidation with a peroxidase, produced five to eight different DNA adducts. For these lower-chlorinated biphenyls, butanol enrichment generally showed a lower recovery. For some higher substituted congeners (3,3',4,4', 5-pentachloro-, 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexachloro-, 2,2',4,4',5, 5'-hexachloro-, and 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl), after butanol enrichment a single dominant spot was observed, which was absent in the nuclease P1 procedure. After incubation of calf thymus DNA with either higher- or lower-chlorinated PCB congeners, we were not able to detect significantly increased levels of oxidative DNA damage above background levels, measured as 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'deoxyguanosine. In view of the carcinogenicity of PCB mixtures in animals and the ability of PCB metabolites to bind covalently to DNA, rats were orally treated with a mixture of PCBs (Aroclor 1242). PCB-DNA adduct levels were analyzed in PCB target organs: liver, thymus, glandular stomach, spleen, testes, seminal vesicles and prostate DNA. In vivo PCB-DNA adducts could not be detected by either the butanol- or by the NP1-enrichment procedure in rat target tissue DNA. Also, no differences in oxidative DNA damage could be observed between PCB-treated rats and controls. These results indicate a lack of DNA reactivity of PCB mixtures in vivo.
20952519	In this study, we compared cross-bred dairy cows in the Susa Valley (Piedmont, northern Italy), reared either near a high-temperature steel production plant (Farms A and B) or in an industry-free area (control). Exposed cows (n = 36) were selected based on mean bulk milk toxic equivalent values of polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and dioxin-like (DL) polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs) equal to 18.56 pg/g fat and 8.56 pg/g of fat in dairy cows from Farms A and B, respectively, exceeding both those permitted by the legislation in force (6 pg/g fat PCDDs and DL-PCDFs/PCBs), and those measured in dairy cows (n = 19) of the farm used as control (1.75 pg/g of fat PCDDs and DL-PCDFs/PCBs). Two types of peripheral blood cell cultures were performed: without (normal cultures for the chromosome abnormality (CA)-test: gaps, chromatid breaks, chromosome breaks and fragments) and with addition of bromodeoxyuridine [for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE)-test]. Both tests revealed a significant (P ≤ 0.05) higher chromosome fragility in the exposed cattle compared to controls: CA/cell mean values (without gaps) were 0.65 ± 0.91, 0.51 ± 0.81 and 0.13 ± 0.39 in Farms A, B and controls, respectively, while SCE/cell mean values were 7.00 ± 2.88, 6.39 ± 2.80 and 5.29 ± 2.51. Although the role of other pollutants (e.g. heavy metals) in the genesis of the recorded chromosome alterations cannot be ruled out, our results confirm the findings of previous research into dioxin-exposed sheep.
23828374	The objective of this study is to compare meconium and maternal serum as biomarkers of fetal exposure to organochlorines (OCs). A subset of 40 meconium samples and complementary maternal sera from the Northern Norway Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study (MISA) were selected. Meconium samples were collected at the earliest opportunity (median 9.0 hours postpartum, range 0-61) and maternal serum in the 2nd trimester (median 19.0 gestational weeks, range 13-34) and analysed for OC contaminants selected from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme's (AMAP) suite of OCs and selected hydroxylated metabolites. Eight compounds with detection frequencies ≥70% in both media (criterion for inclusion) were included in the statistical analyses. Median concentration ratios for p,p'-DDE, HCB, trans-nonachlor and cis-nonachlor favoured meconium, and PCB 138 and 153 and OH-PCB 146 and 172 were higher in maternal serum. All inter-media correlations were significant (Spearman's rho) for wet-weight concentrations and improved when concentrations in a small subset of 15 meconium and serum samples were both lipid-adjusted; only OH-PCB 146 slightly favoured maternal serum. Multivariable linear regression modelling confirmed that maternal serum was the most consistent predictor of meconium concentrations, with gestational age and time of meconium sampling improving the models. Although more challenging to analyse, the lipid-adjusted OC concentration in meconium is viewed as a sensitive and informative fetal exposure index when taking into account the gestational age and its postpartum sampling time. 
12842777	We determined methylsulfonyl metabolites of chlorinated biphenyls (MeSO2-CBs) and 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE) in human adipose, liver, brain, and lung tissues obtained from 11 Belgian individuals (9-62 years of age). The total concentration of MeSO2-CBs (lipid weight basis) decreased in the following order: liver (mean, 9.30 ng/g; range, 1.68-27.03 ng/g lipid) > lung [mean, 2.72 ng/g; range, not detected (ND) to 11.54 ng/g lipid] > adipose tissue (mean, 1.57 ng/g; range, 0.33-4.33 ng/g lipid) > brain (mean, 0.24 ng/g; range, ND-0.56 ng/g lipid). The profiles of MeSO2-CBs and MeSO2-DDE in each tissue were similar for all 11 subjects. In adipose, brain, and lung tissues, 4'-MeSO2-CB87, 4'-MeSO2-CB101, and 3-MeSO2-CB149 (except brain) occurred at higher concentrations than did other MeSO2-CBs. However, 3'-MeSO2-CB132 was by far the most abundant congener in liver, contributing on average to approximately 60% of the sum of MeSO2-CBs. The concentrations of 3-MeSO2-DDE in different tissues were at the same or lower levels than the total concentrations of MeSO2-CBs. This study suggests that the distribution patterns of MeSO2-CBs and MeSO2-DDE in humans differ between liver and other tissues. Moreover, these profiles differ from those found in other mammals, such as polar bears, porpoises, and otters.
19058852	To assess occupational exposure, we determined the concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in human serum samples from 26 incinerator workers (10 industrial waste and 16 municipal solid waste incinerator workers), 38 residents near the facilities and 7 inhabitants (as control subjects) living over 10 km away from any incinerator facilities in Korea. The mean TEQ(WHO) levels of PCDD/Fs in the industrial and MSWI workers were 41.57 and 9.86 pg TEQ(WHO) g(-1) lipid, respectively. For the residents, the mean TEQ(WHO) was 13.47 pg TEQ(WHO) g(-1) lipid (residents near IWI, MSWI, and control subjects: 17.64, 13.31, and 6.91 pg TEQ(WHO) g(-1) lipid). Higher levels of certain PCDD/F congeners, mainly PCDFs, were detected in the serum of industrial incinerator workers in comparison to the levels measured in the residents. Significant differences were observed for PCDFs, the major compounds were OCDF, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF, and the minor components 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF, and 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF (p<0.01). The PCDD/F congener patterns and concentrations measured in the 71 serum samples examined suggest that the industrial incinerator workers were exposed to PCDD/Fs in the workplace, possibly through inhalation and/or skin contact. In contrast, the levels and congener patterns of PCBs measured were similar in all subjects, indicating that workers from the incinerator facilities examined were not subjected to additional exposure to these compounds.
6270054	An analytical method was developed to quantitate polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls (PCBs and PBBs, respectively) in human serum. The method includes denaturation of the proteins in serum, extraction, adsorption chromatography, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The coefficients of variation for determining the in vivo bound PCBs and PBBs ranged from 11.7 to 29.8% and 7.1 to 14.0%, respectively. The method is capable of measuring 10 ng PCBs and PBBs/mL in 4 mL serum.
19750116	BACKGROUND: The etiologies of the male urogenital anomalies cryptorchidism and hypospadias are poorly understood. It has been suggested, however, that in utero hormone levels may be related to risk. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds, may alter hormone levels and thereby affect the fetus. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether in utero PCB exposure is related to cryptorchidism and hypospadias, we examined PCB levels among pregnant women enrolled in the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). METHODS: The CPP enrolled pregnant women at 12 U.S. medical centers between 1959 and 1965. For the present research, we analyzed third-trimester serum samples from the mothers of 230 sons with cryptorchidism, 201 sons with hypospadias, and 593 sons with neither condition. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression and examined the associations of each anomaly with individual PCB congener levels, sum of PCBs, and several functional groupings of PCBs. RESULTS: In general, the ORs for cryptorchidism or hypospadias showed no notable associations with individual PCB congener levels or functional groupings of PCBs. However, the ORs and 95% CIs for the sum of PCBs associated with hypospadias were as follows: 0-1.9 microg/L, reference group; 2-2.9 microg/L, OR = 1.57, 95% CI, 1.05-2.34; 3-3.9 microg/L, OR = 1.45, 95% CI, 0.90-2.34; and > or = 4.0 microg/L, OR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.06-2.68; p-value for trend = 0.08. CONCLUSIONS: Given the large number of associations examined, these findings do not strongly support the hypothesis that PCBs are associated with cryptorchidism or hypospadias. Because population serum PCB levels at the time of sample collection were considerably higher than levels at present, it is unlikely that current PCB exposure is related to the development of either anomaly. 
11936688	Screening assessment methods have been developed for semi- and non-volatile persistent organic pollutants (POPs) for human blood and solid environmental media. The specific methodology is developed for measuring the presence of "native" compounds, specifically, a variety of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), and for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The method is demonstrated on anonymous Red Cross blood samples as well as two potential environmental sources, tracked in soil and dog hair. This work is based on previously developed methods for semi-volatile hydrocarbon exposure from fuels usage and similarly employs liquid solvent extraction, evaporative volume reduction. and subsequent specialized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS). Standard curves, estimates of recovery efficiency, and specific GC-MS SIM quantification methods were developed for common pesticides including diazinon. aldrin, chlorpyrifos, malathion, dieldrin, DDT, permethrin, cyhalothrin, and cypermethrin, and for seven selected PCBs. Trace levels of certain PCBs and pesticides such as permethrin, dieldrin, malathion, lindane, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos were tentatively identified in anonymous blood samples as well as in two potential environmental sources. tracked in soil and dog hair. The method provides a simple screening procedure for various media and a variety of common organic pollutants without extensive sample preparation. It is meant to complement and augment data from more specific or complex methodology, to provide initial broad spectrum guidance for designing targeted experiments, and to provide confirmatory evidence for the usual metabolic biomarker measurements made to assess human exposure.
17583774	The composition of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in serum samples is compared between a cohort previously exposed to PCBs from working at a capacitor plant (n=180) and a cohort of Great Lakes sport-caught fish eaters (n=217). Fourteen congeners were measured in both samples. A multiple logistic regression model differentiating the two groups as a function of relative proportions amongst congeners 74, 138, 153, 180, and 201 correctly classifies more than 99% of the people (395/397); higher proportions of congeners 74, 153, and 201 characterize capacitor plant workers, while higher proportions of congeners 138 and 180 characterize fish eaters. The pattern is driven by the relative amounts of 74+153+201 compared to 138+180; all of the fish eaters, but only 5% of the capacitor plant workers, have a greater percent of 138+180 than 74+153+201. Consideration of combinations of congener levels and their relative proportions is relevant to tracking route of exposure and may also be relevant to modeling effects on health outcomes.
9241822	Coplanar PCBs in human serum were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution mess spectrometry in 46 pulp and paper mill workers and 16 community residents with no specific known source of PCB exposure. The relative contribution of coplanar PCBs, PCDDs, and PCDFs to the total 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalents (TEQs) were compared using the toxic equivalency factors proposed by Safe [1] and the factors recently proposed by WHO [2]. The mean concentrations of PCB-126 and PCB-169 were higher in paper mill workers than in community residents. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Serum PCB-126, but not PCB-169, was correlated with body mass index (Spearman's r = 0.40, p = 0.002). Serum PCB-169, but not PCB-126, was correlated with age (Spearman's r = 0.54, p = 0.0001). Multiple linear regression analysis for log-transformed combined PCBs showed that age (p = 0.008), body mass index (p = 0.031), and eating locally caught fish (p = 0.019) were statistically significant predictors. The majority of the total TEQ in serum is due to PCDDs (63%), whereas PCDFs account for 21% and coplanar PCBs account for 15% when calculated using the TEFs proposed by Safe. The percent contributions from PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs were 66%, 24%, and 10% respectively when calculated based on the TEFs proposed by WHO. Age, body mass index, and consumption of locally caught fish are significant predictors for coplanar PCB levels in human serum. Serum PCDDs were the major contributors to the total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent toxicity in this study.
17382313	The upper Hudson River has been heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) due to discharges from former electrical capacitor plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, NY. An epidemiologic study was conducted to assess the impact of dietary and residential exposure on PCB body burden among older, long-term, non-occupationally exposed adults living in the vicinity of these former capacitor plants. The study population consisted of 133 persons 55-74 years of age who had lived in Hudson Falls or Fort Edward for 25 years or more. The comparison group consisted of 120 persons from Glens Falls, which is upriver. Both groups were interviewed, and blood samples were obtained for congener-specific PCB analysis. Persons from the study area reported greater past consumption of Hudson River fish than did the comparison area, but current rates were very low in both areas. The geometric mean serum PCB concentrations for the study and comparison populations did not differ significantly (3.07 ppb wet weight and 3.23 ppb, respectively, for total PCB). Serum PCB concentrations increased with cumulative lifetime exposure to PCBs from Hudson River fish consumption (p<0.10). Persons who lived within 800 m of the river did not have significantly greater serum PCB concentrations than the control population, nor did persons who lived downwind and within 800 m of a PCB-contaminated site. The results indicate no detectable differences in serum PCB levels according to proximity or wind direction relative to local point sources, but lifetime consumption of Hudson River fish was positively associated with serum PCB concentrations.
3921971	The uptake and vascular transport of ingested Aroclor 1242, an isomeric mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), was investigated in experimental animals. High concentrations of ingested PCB were found in the chylomicron fraction of thoracic duct lymph. When the lymph flow was exteriorized PCB were not subsequently found in the vascular circulation. When lymph was not exteriorized plasma PCB concentrations reached maximal levels 6 hr after ingestion. Less than 1% of total plasma PCB was detected in cellular fractions of blood over a 10-hr period following ingestion. Chylomicrons contained 31% of total plasma PCB 30 min after ingestion, decreasing to less than 6% at 4 hr. A maximum of 10% of plasma PCB at 1 hr, and less than 5% at 6 hr, after ingestion was associated with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL). Although PCB enter the vascular circulation with the chylomicron fractions of lymph, delipoproteinated plasma contained 52% of the total PCB in blood collected 30 min after ingestion. This level increased to 78% after 2 hr, and remained constant at about 80% for an additional 8-hr period. High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) examinations of delipoproteinated plasma from blood taken 6 hr after PCB ingestion showed elution of greater than 95% of plasma PCB to coincide with the albumin peak. Electrophoretic examinations of delipoproteinated plasma showed the association of PCB with albumin to be noncovalent. The results suggest that apolar PCB are absorbed into intestinal epithelial cells from which they are secreted into the lymphatic drainage sequestered within the apolar core of chylomicrons, that these PCB transit the thoracic duct and enter the vascular circulation within chylomicrons and are metabolized or otherwise released from chylomicrons during hepatic chylomicron clearance, and that resulting PCB or PCB derivatives circulate in association with plasma albumins.
18974082	A 40-year follow-up study was conducted to examine mortality among 1,664 patients in Japan suffering from "Yusho," a disease caused by ingestion of rice oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. To evaluate the effects of exposure on mortality, the authors calculated standardized mortality ratios. National mortality rates for major causes of death were used as reference points. A total of 1,596 Yusho patients (95.9%) were followed until death or the end of the study (December 31, 2007). The standardized mortality ratios for most major causes of death were not significantly elevated, with the exceptions of all types of cancer (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.66), liver cancer (SMR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.91), and lung cancer (SMR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.57) in males. In addition, the standardized mortality ratios for all cancers, liver cancer, and lung cancer among males tended to decrease over time. Results from this study suggest that the carcinogenicity of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans must be taken into account when evaluating mortality risk.
16780830	The secondary sex ratio is the ratio of male to female live births and historically has ranged from 102 to 106 males to 100 females. Temporal declines have been reported in many countries prompting authors to hypothesize an environmental etiology. Blood specimens were obtained from 99 women aged 24-34 prior to attempting pregnancy and quantified for 76 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners using dual column gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Women were prospectively followed until pregnancy or 12 cycles of trying. The odds of a male birth for three PCB groupings (total, estrogenic, anti-estrogenic) controlling for maternal characteristics were estimated using logistic regression. Among the 50 women with live births and PCB data, 26 female and 24 male infants were born (ratio 0.92). After adjusting for age and body mass index, odds of a male birth were elevated among women in the second (OR=1.29) and third (OR=1.48) tertiles of estrogenic PCBs; odds (OR=0.70) were reduced among women in the highest tertile of anti-estrogenic PCBs. All confidence intervals included one. The direction of the odds ratios in this preliminary study varied by PCB groupings, supporting the need to study specific PCB patterns when assessing environmental influences on the secondary sex ratio.
15910784	The major determinants of human polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) body burden include the source and route of exposure and the toxicokinetic processes occurring after uptake. However, the relative importance of each factor for individual subjects cannot currently be determined. The present study characterizes levels and patterns of PCB congeners in a large cohort of adult Akwesasne Mohawks with historical PCB exposure. Total serum PCB ranged from 0.29 to 48.32 ng/g and was higher in adult men than in women (median of 3.81 vs. 2.94 ng/g). The mean serum congener profile for the full cohort was dominated by persistent penta- to hepta-chlorinated biphenyls; several labile congeners were also prominent. In order to provide additional information on individual body burden determinants, multivariate exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to the congener-specific serum PCB data. A self-training receptor model, polytopic vector analysis (PVA), was employed to determine the number, composition, and relative proportions of independent congener patterns that contributed to the overall serum PCB profile for each Mohawk subject. PVA identified five such patterns, each of which was characterized by a unique mix of congeners. One pattern observed in a limited number of Mohawks was similar to those reported for air sampled near contaminated sediment deposits at Akwesasne and for volatilized Aroclor 1248 and is hypothesized to reflect recent inhalation exposure in these subjects. A second pattern was consistent with unaltered Aroclor 1254. A third pattern, resembling Aroclor 1262 but without labile congeners, was correlated with age and is interpreted as representing a lifetime PCB accumulation profile. The final two patterns were dominated by subsets of major persistent congeners and are hypothesized to reflect intermediate bioaccumulation profiles and/or differences in individual toxicokinetics. The results confirm the utility of a multivariate exploratory analysis approach to congener-specific PCB data and provide additional insight into the exposure and individual factors that determine PCB body burden in this population.
3097280	In order to assess the extent of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and potential health effects, a clinical-epidemiologic survey was initiated among 205 workers at a capacitor manufacturing plant. The geometric mean serum PCB level for workers was 18.2 ppb (SD 2.88), with a range of 0 to 424 ppb. Multiple regression analysis found duration of employment, cumulative occupational exposure, cumulative fish consumption, and cholesterol level to be significant predictors of log serum PCB levels. Of these predictors, duration of employment and cumulative occupational exposure were the strongest contributors to the regression model, indicating the dual importance of opportunity for dermal contact and respiratory exposure level in contributing to workers' serum PCB levels.
20573785	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are known to reduce serum thyroxine (T(4)) in rats, but the relative effects of individual PCB congeners on thyroid hormones are not known. Thus, male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered Aroclor 1254, Aroclor 1242 (4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg/day), PCB 95 (2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl), PCB 99 (2,2',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), PCB 118 (2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl) (2, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day), PCB 126 (3,3'4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl) (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 microg/kg/day), TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) (0.14, 0.43, 1.3, or 3.9 microg/kg/day), or corn oil via oral gavage for 7 days. Rats were necropsied 24 h after the last dose. Serum thyroid hormone levels were evaluated by radioimmunoassay, and induction of hepatic Cyp1a (a TCDD-inducible protein) and Cyp2b (a phenobarbital [PB]-inducible protein) activity was determined by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase assays, respectively. Significant increases in Cyp1a activity occurred in response to PCBs, except PCB 95 and PCB 99. Aroclor 1254, PCB 99, and PCB 118 significantly induced Cyp2b activity. Serum total T(4) and free T(4) were dramatically reduced in response to each of the seven treatments in a dose-dependent manner. The marked T(4) reductions occurred in response to Aroclor 1254, PCB 99 (a PB-type congener), and PCB 118 (a mixed-type congener). In contrast, reductions in serum triiodothyronine (total and free) were variable and mild, and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was not significantly affected by any of the compounds. These data indicate that the PB and mixed-type PCB congeners are more effective than the TCDD-type PCB congeners at reducing serum T(4).
11695625	An improved synthesis of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which are structurally related to the major hydroxy PCB congeners identified in human plasma is described. The coupling of (chlorinated) aryl boronic acids with bromochloro anisoles using the standard conditions of the Suzuki coupling gave the desired hydroxylated PCB metabolites in good to excellent yields. The approach offers the advantage of high selectivity and good yields compared to conventional methods such as the Cadogan reaction and allows the use of less toxic starting materials.
14587909	The development of second-generation nestling American kestrels (Falco sparverius) was altered by in ovo exposure of only one parent to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Polychlorinated biphenyls appear to alter nestling development through both maternally and paternally mediated effects. In 1998, F0 parent kestrels consumed approximately 5 to 7 microg total PCBs/g bird/d (Aroclors 1248:1254: 1260) for approximately 100 d prior to eggs hatching; these eggs, containing total PCB concentrations of 34.1 microg/g, produced 13 F1 offspring, which were then paired in 1999 with unexposed kestrels to examine developmental effects of maternal or paternal in ovo PCB exposure. Using a toxicokinetics model, eggs from the maternally exposed group had predicted PCB levels of 0.03 to 0.34 microg/g, with enriched higher chlorinated congeners. Polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations in eggs of all generations have recently been found in eggs and nestlings of free-ranging eagles. Consistent with the first generation, maternally exposed F2 females generally were larger, had altered growth rates, and delayed maximal growth and fledging compared with control females. Maternally exposed F2 males were heavier but had shorter bones, grew more quickly and earlier, and fledged 2 d later than control males. In the maternally exposed group, concentrations of plasma triiodothyronine were elevated in F2 females but suppressed in F2 males. Paternally exposed F2 hatchlings of both sexes were comparable in size to controls with the exception of having longer tarsi bones, but subsequently showed slower, delayed growth (both sexes) and fledging (females) and lower thyroxine concentrations (males). The alterations in thyroid hormones in the F2 generation are discussed in light of the enrichment of higher chlorinated PCB congeners and hydroxylated PCB congeners. The developmental changes in the kestrel nestlings are likely a function of several possible mechanisms involving maternal PCB deposition, parental behavior, and neurobehavioral and endocrine-thyroid function in nestlings.
3132898	To evaluate the potential for using domestic animals in the surveillance of environmental exposures, we collected serum samples for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) analysis from nine dogs in Monroe County, Indiana, where people had been shown to have been exposed to PCBs. Nine dogs in Atlanta, Georgia, served as comparisons. Results indicated that canine serum PCB levels in contaminated areas (median = 3.0 ppb) tend to be greater than those in uncontaminated areas (median = 1.7 ppb [p = .06, Mann-Whitney U test]). This finding suggests that pet dogs may serve as sentinels of human exposure to environmental PCB contamination.
6813209	In 1979, a mass outbreak of poisoning occurred in Central Taiwan due to the ingestion of rice-bran oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The major PCB isomers and congeners in the toxic rice oil and in the blood of PCB-poisoned patients were characterized by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using a highly efficient glass capillary column. The elimination of some major individual PCBs from blood of these patients was studied. The results indicate that tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls with adjacent unsubstituted carbon atoms at meta-para positions are rapidly eliminated from the blood of patients, while PCBs with the same degree of chlorination but with adjacent unsubstituted carbon atoms at ortho-meta positions are eliminated more slowly. The results also indicate that most of the hexa- and heptachlorobiphenyls, with adjacent unsubstituted carbon atoms at ortho-meta positions of the biphenyl ring, are eliminated very slowly. Laboratory-animal studies have indicated that PCB excretion depends primarily on the rate of metabolism; therefore these differences in rates of elimination of PCBs should reflect the differences in their rates of metabolism.
3021964	Twelve serum analytes [triglycerides, cholesterol, total and conjugated bilirubin, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), alkaline phosphatase (AP), gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), beta-glucuronidase (beta-glu), alanine aminopeptidase (AAP), and 5'-nucleotidase (5'nuc)] were measured to investigate their correlation with exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT). The relationship between serum lipids, lipophilic toxicants, and the analytes was also evaluated. The beta-glu, 5'nuc, triglycerides, cholesterol, and total bilirubin correlated positively and significantly with log concentrations of serum total PCBs and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a metabolite of DDT. The more highly chlorinated PCBs (Aroclor 1260) had significant, positive correlations with several serum analytes, but the less chlorinated PCBs (Aroclor 1242) correlated significantly and negatively only with HDL-cholesterol. Triglyceride- and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins were added to serum to determine the effects of lipids on these assays. Several were spuriously elevated. AP and beta-glu were not affected by lipoprotein addition with the methods used in this study. AAP was increased significantly only at triglyceride concentrations exceeding 400 mg/dl. Lipoproteins may be elevated because of deranged lipid metabolism in response to PCBs, or PCBs may be elevated because elevated lipoproteins are present, as in familial triglyceridemia, a relatively common dyslipoproteinemia. Because this relationship is not well understood with respect to cause and effect, we propose the further use in epidemiological investigations of assay methods that are little affected by blood lipids yet are correlated with PCB concentrations. Congener-specific quantification of PCBs would help elucidate the effects of PCBs on assays used to monitor health effects.
21138777	The association between dietary patterns and blood dioxin levels has not been fully investigated. The present study population consisted of 755 men and 901 women (aged 15-73years) living in 90 different areas of 30 prefectures of Japan. Dietary habits were assessed by inquiring about the consumption frequency of 28 foods, food groups and beverages. In addition, the blood levels of 29 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (DL-PCBs) congeners were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The median total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) in the blood, which was calculated on the basis of the toxicity equivalency factors of WHO (2005), was 16 pg TEQg(-1) lipid. Principal component analysis identified five dietary patterns: Healthy diet (high intake of vegetables and fruits); Meat/High fat intake (high intake of meat, meat products, and eggs); Seafood and Alcohol (high intake of fish, shellfish, and alcoholic beverages); Miscellaneous; and Milk products and Alcohol intake (high intake of milk, Milk products, and alcoholic beverages). After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, and smoking habits, the Seafood and Alcohol pattern scores were significantly related to higher blood levels of total TEQ and PCDDs/PCDFs/DL-PCBs, and the Milk products and Alcohol pattern scores were correlated with higher blood levels of DL-PCBs. More detailed analysis showed that the intake frequencies for alcoholic beverages and seafood were independently and positively associated with total TEQ and the TEQ of PCDFs and DL-PCBs. The association between alcoholic beverage intake and PCDDs was also significant. Analysis of dietary patterns may be useful for identifying the dietary characteristics of individuals with a high dioxin body burden.
14718345	Worker exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in renovation of prefabricated houses was assessed by biological monitoring of 24 PCB congeners including the 10 most abundant PCBs in elastic polysulphide sealants. Serum samples from 22 exposed and 21 non-exposed men were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization. Total PCB concentration of 24 PCB congeners in workers' serum varied between 0.6 and 17.8 microg/l (mean 3.9 microg/l, median 1.9 microg/l). The Finnish upper reference limit for occupationally non-exposed persons (3 microg/l) was exceeded in the serum samples of 10 workers. Concentrations for non-exposed persons were 0.3-3.0 microg/l (mean 1.7 microg/l, median 1.5 microg/l). The concentration for the sum of the 10 most abundant PCB congeners in elastic polysulphide sealants in serum samples taken in autumn after the renovation season was 2-10 times higher than in samples from the same workers (n=5) taken in the previous spring. The concentrations of PCB congeners PCB 28, 52, 77, 101, 138, 153 and 180 in hygienic samples taken from the breathing zone of the workers were low, ranging from not detected to 3.1 microg/m3. The concentrations of PCB 28 and 52 in sera were positively correlated with the concentrations in air samples taken from the breathing zone of six workers (r=0.70 and 0.80).
22406104	A quantitative method that requires only a small volume (50μL) of blood has been developed for the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Target analytes in both plasma sample (DBSV) and dried blood spot (DBS) were analyzed by a gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometer (GC/HRMS). Measurements of standard reference materials by the developed method were in agreement with those certified values. Linear correlation coefficients were found to be 0.9984 and 0.9965 for DBS and DBSV analysis, respectively. Other analytical criteria, such as limits of detection, recoveries, precision, accuracy and linearity of the proposed method are also reported. From recovery studies, the addition of formic acid to the extraction solvent was found to be effective in extracting PBDEs and PCBs from filter paper. The PBDE and PCB levels in spiked DBS were monitored at room temperature for up to 30 days and the variations of target analytes were found to be insignificant. Our results suggest that DBS sampling technique is feasible for PBDE and PCBs biomonitoring in human population.
8903761	The neurological optimality of 418 Dutch children was evaluated at the age of 18 months, in order to determine whether prenatal and breast milk mediated exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins affected neurological development. Half of the infants were breast-fed, the other half were formula-fed. PCB concentrations in cord and maternal plasma were used as a measure of prenatal exposure to PCBs. To measure postnatal exposure, PCB and dioxin congeners were determined in human milk and in formula milk. After adjusting for covariates, transplacental PCB exposure was negatively related to the neurological condition at 18 months. Although greater amounts of PCBs and dioxins are transferred via nursing than via placental passage, an effect of lactational exposure to PCBs and dioxins could not be detected. We even found a beneficial effect of breast-feeding on the fluency of movements. We conclude that transplacental PCB passage has a small negative effect on the neurological condition in 18-month-old toddlers.
20542073	Vitellogenin (Vtg) is a phospho-lipo-glycoprotein produced by oviparous animals in response to estrogen receptor (ER) binding. The presence of Vtg in juvenile and male fish liver and plasma has been used as biomarker to evaluate levels of environmental contaminants as dioxin and PCBs. Interaction of dioxins and PCBs with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) may affect reproduction by recruitment of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PCB-126, a co-planar PCB prototypical AhR agonist, and of PCB-153, a non-coplanar PCB lacking dioxine-like activity, on Vtg expression in young fish (Spaurus aurata) after a 12 or 24h exposure to PCBs as well as 48h following PCBs removal. Vtg expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and by Western-blot analysis. Our results showed an increased Vtg expression following PCBs administration, with a maximum level after 12h of exposure to either PCB-126, PCB-153 or a mixture of both PCBs. Following this estrogenic activity, an anti-estrogenic activity was detected after 24h of incubation with PCB-126 (alone or mixed with PCB-153), suggested by a decrease in Vtg expression likely through AhR, as a consequence of a hypothetic defence mechanism to endogenous or exogenous ligands.
17574648	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were commercially produced between 1959 and 1984 in eastern Slovakia. Improper handling led to a highly contaminated local environment and high levels of PCBs in humans and wildlife in the Michalovce area. The aim of this study was to analyse serum for methylsulfonyl metabolites of PCB (MeSO(2)-PCBs) and DDE (3-MeSO(2)-DDE) in serum samples from pregnant women and in a selected number of paired cord blood samples to assess maternal sulfone levels and patterns, and transplacental transfer of these metabolites. The donating women were from two districts in eastern Slovakia. A liquid-liquid extraction method together with separation of substance groups and further clean-up on silica gel columns were applied prior to analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 3-MeSO(2)-DDE was the major methyl sulfone in most of the samples followed by a yet not identified MeSO(2)-hexaCB, 4'-MeSO(2)-CB101, 4'-MeSO(2)-CB87 and 4-MeSO(2)-CB149. The women from the contaminated area had three times higher concentrations of the MeSO(2)-PCBs than women from the reference area. This is the first report on methyl sulfone metabolites of PCB and DDE in human cord serum. It is shown that these metabolites are transported through the placenta. The levels of MeSO(2)-PCBs in the maternal serum were about 1.5 times higher than in the corresponding cord serum on a lipid weight basis. For 3-MeSO(2)-DDE, the levels were about the same in maternal and cord serum. The difference in the maternal:cord ratio, comparing MeSO(2)-PCBs with 3-MeSO(2)-DDE might be due to differences in transport through the placenta caused by their different affinities for lipoproteins and plasma proteins.
21299357	Animal data indicate that developmental tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure alters immune function; however, the potential immunotoxicity of dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the developing infant is an understudied area. The aim of the current study is to examine the association between maternal and early postnatal PCB concentrations in relation to total infant serum immunoglobulin concentrations determined at 6-months-of-age. We selected 384 mother-infant pairs participating in a birth cohort study in Eastern Slovakia. PCB concentrations of several congeners were determined in maternal and cord serum samples and in infant serum samples collected at 6-months-of-age using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Total immunoglobulin (Ig) G, A, and M concentrations were determined by nephelometry, and IgE concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Linear regression models with adjustment for potential confounding factors were used to estimate the associations between maternal, cord, and 6-month infant PCB concentrations and total serum immunoglobulins. The median maternal serum concentration of PCB-153 was 140?ng/g lipid, ?10-fold higher than concentrations in childbearing-age women in the United States during the same period. Maternal, cord, or 6-month infant PCB concentrations were not associated with total serum immunoglobulin levels at 6 months, regardless of the timing of PCB exposure, PCB congener, or specific immunoglobulin. In this population, which has high PCB concentrations relative to most populations in the world today, we did not observe any association between maternal and early postnatal PCB concentrations and total immunoglobulin measures of IgG, IgA, IgM, or IgE.
16963131	Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are characterized by extended fasting during which they rely entirely on their own body reserves. During fasts, lipids are mobilized from blubber to match the energy requirements of the animal. This transfer frees toxic fat-soluble pollutants into the blood circulation, which may exert adverse health effects, especially in young and developing animals. We investigated the dynamics of mobilization of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the blubber of northern elephant seal pups during the post-weaning fast. Longitudinal samples of blubber and serum were collected from free-ranging animals throughout the fast at Año Nuevo, California. Blubber biopsies were separated into inner and outer layers. The PCB profiles of blubber and serum consisted mainly of penta- (PCB-101, -110, -118), hexa- (PCB-138, -153) and hepta- (PCB-180, -183, -187) chlorobiphenyls, which accounted for almost 90% of the total PCB burden. Total PCB concentrations in inner blubber increased significantly between early and late fasting (563.6+/-162.0 microg/kg lipids at early versus 911.6+/-513.1 microg/kg lipids at late fasting) whereas they remained fairly constant in outer blubber (572.6+/-134.8 microg/kg lipids at early versus 659.2+/-158.8 microg/kg lipids at late fasting). A corresponding rise of PCB concentrations was observed in serum during the second half of the fast (3.8+/-1.1 microg/l serum at early versus 7.2+/-0.9 microg/l at late fasting). The longitudinal changes in circulating total PCBs could not be explained by the changes in serum lipid fractions (cholesterol, phospholipids, triacylglycerols and free fatty acids). The increases in total PCB concentrations in inner blubber and serum were more pronounced in leaner animals, which suggests that they might be more at risk to potential toxic effects.
12151633	Numerous mechanisms have been postulated to explain how polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons alter thyroid homeostasis with almost all data derived from studies using the rat. This study compared the sensitivity of rats and mice to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-induced hypothyroxemia. Male and female C57BL/6J mice and Long-Evans rats were dosed orally for 4 consecutive days with either PCB126 (0.03-300.0 microg/kg/day) or PCB153 (0.3-300.0 mg/kg/day). Trunk blood and livers were collected 24 h after the last dose and used to determine total serum thyroxine (T(4)) and hepatic microsomal T(4) glucuronidation activity. Hepatic microsomal ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD) activities were also determined as markers for Ah receptor or phenobarbital response unit activation, respectively. PCB126 did not affect T(4) in the mouse but decreased T(4) (up to 50%) in the rat. PCB153 decreased T(4) (up to 80%) in both the rat and the mouse. PCB126 increased EROD in both rats (12- to 22-fold) and mice (15- to 20-fold). PCB153 induced hepatic PROD activity in both rats (30-fold) and mice (4-fold). T(4) glucuronidation was increased approximately 2- to 3-fold in both rats and mice treated with PCB153. PCB126 increased T(4) glucuronidation 13-fold in rats but only marginally (20%) in mice at the highest doses. Western blot analysis confirmed the PCB126-induced changes in expression of UGT1A in rats and the minimal increase in mice. These data suggest that species differences in response to chemicals that induce hypothyroxinemia are due to differential induction of hepatic UGT enzymes.
12842779	The aim of this study was to determine human prenatal and postnatal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (polychlorobiphenylols; OH-PCBs), and pentachlorophenol (PCP). The median PBDE fresh-weight concentrations in maternal and cord blood plasma and in breast milk were 24, 4.3, and 75 pg/g, respectively. The PCB concentrations were approximately 60 times higher in each compartment (1,560, 277, and 4,310 pg/g, respectively). Calculated on a lipid weight basis, the levels were comparable in maternal blood plasma and breast milk. In contrast to PCBs, differences were found between PBDE congener distribution in maternal and cord blood plasma. The OH-PCBs constituted up to 26% of the PCB levels in maternal blood plasma and 53% in cord blood plasma, with levels of 120 and 88 pg/g fresh weight, respectively, and in breast milk 3 pg/g. The corresponding concentrations for PCP were 2,830, 1,960, and 20 pg/g. The ratios of PCB to OH-PCB were 13, 3, and 1,400 in maternal, cord plasma, and breast milk, respectively. It is evident that prenatal exposures occur for all the analytes. Moreover, the exposure continues after birth via breast milk. However, levels of OH-PCBs and PCP in breast milk are low compared with levels in blood plasma. Exposures to both PCBs and PBDEs, and in particular to the endocrine-active halogenated phenolic compounds, are of concern and implicate a potential risk for developmental disturbances.
9681980	As a consequence of contamination by effluents from local electronics manufacturing facilities, the New Bedford Harbor and estuary in southeastern Massachusetts is among the sites in the United States that are considered the most highly contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Since 1993, measures of intrauterine PCB exposure have been obtained for a sample of New Bedford area infants. Among 122 mother-infant pairs, we identified four milk samples with total PCB levels that were significantly higher than the rest, with estimated total PCBs ranging from 1,100 to 2,400 ng/g milk fat compared with an overall mean of 320 ng/g milk fat for the 122 women. The congener profile and history of one case was consistent with past occupational PCB exposures. Otherwise, the source of PCB exposures in these cases was difficult to specify. Environmental exposures including those from fish consumption were likely, whereas residence adjacent to a PCB-contaminated site was considered an unlikely exposure source. In all four cases, the infants were full-term, healthy newborns. Because the developing nervous system is believed to be particularly susceptible to PCBs (for example, prenatal PCB exposures have been associated with prematurity, decrements in birth weight and gestation time, and behavioral and developmental deficits in later infancy and childhood, including decrements in IQ), it is critical to ascertain if breast-feeding is a health risk for the women's infants. Despite the potential for large postnatal PCB exposures via breast milk, there is limited evidence of significant developmental toxicity associated with the transmission of moderate PCB concentrations through breast milk. Breast-feeding is associated with substantial health benefits including better cognitive skills among breast-fed compared with formula-fed infants. We conclude, based on evidence from other studies, that the benefits of breast-feeding probably outweigh any risk from PCB exposures via breast milk among the four New Bedford infants. In this case report, PCB analysis of breast milk and infant cord serum was a research tool. PCB analysis of milk is rarely done clinically, in part because it is difficult to use the results of such analyses to predict health risks. Substantial effort is needed to achieve a better understanding of the clinical and public health significance of PCB exposures, particularly among potentially susceptible groups such as infants and children. Such efforts are critical to improving the clinical and public health management of widespread and ongoing population exposures to PCBs.
3930756	The effect of a single oral gavage with a mixture of Aroclors 1254 and 1260 on 24-h production of urinary homovanillic acid was determined in the laboratory rat. Adult male Wistar-derived rats were exposed to a single dose of corn oil, either alone or containing equal amounts of Aroclors 1254 and 1260 at a dosage of 500 or 1000 mg/kg. Urinary homovanillic acid concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The 500-mg/kg group showed a transient increase in homovanillic acid production, while the 1000-mg/kg group showed a biphasic response-an initial decrease (due to decreased food consumption) followed by a prolonged elevation. Only transient changes in body weight, food and water consumption, and urine output were observed. The results demonstrate that peripheral measurement of a dopamine metabolite may provide a means of monitoring changes in an important neurotransmitter system after exposure to a putative neurotoxin.
16223788	BACKGROUND: Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POP), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE), are widely found in the environment and considered potential endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDC). Their impact on male fertility is still unknown. METHODS: To explore the hypothesis that POP is associated with altered sperm chromatin integrity, a cross-sectional study involving 707 adult males (193 Inuits from Greenland, 178 Swedish fishermen, 141 men from Warsaw, Poland, and 195 men from Kharkiv, Ukraine) was carried out. Serum levels of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), as a proxy of the total PCB burden, and of p,p'-DDE were determined. Sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) was used to assess sperm DNA/chromatin integrity. RESULTS: We found a strong and monotonically increasing DNA fragmentation index with increasing serum levels of CB-153 among European but not Inuit men, reaching a 60% higher average level in the highest exposure group. No significant associations were found between SCSA-derived parameters and p, p'-DDE serum concentrations. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that human dietary PCB exposure might have a negative impact on the sperm chromatin integrity of adult males but additional issues, including differences in the genetic background and lifestyle habits, still need to be elucidated. 
17204274	A fast extraction and clean-up method for the simultaneous determination of PCBs and PBDEs has been developed. The procedure consisted of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the analytes on an Oasis HLB cartridge and the subsequent on-line fat elimination by directly dropping the eluate from the SPE cartridge onto a second cartridge containing layers of activated neutral silica gel and sulphuric acid modified silica gel. Detection limits using a gas chromatography coupled with an ion trap detector in the tandem mass spectrometry mode were from 0.03 to 0.3 pg/microL for PCBs and from 0.07 to 1.3 pg/microL for PBDEs. Repeatability (lower than 11%) and reproducibility (lower than 17%), expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD, n=4), were satisfactory. The feasibility of the method developed for the determination of the target compounds was evaluated by participation in several rounds of interlaboratory exercises involving human serum with a wide range of PBDE and PCB concentrations. The method has been applied to the evaluation of PBDEs and PCBs in human serum samples of up to 1 mL.
19328048	Optimization of analytical instrumentation is essential when analyses of persistent organic pollutants in human serum are performed at ultra-trace levels. This research describes the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum using gas chromatography coupled with a mass selective detector (GC/MSD) in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. We selected PCB-58 and PCB-186 as internal standards (ISs) for the method development, and newborn calf serum (NCS) was chosen as the matrix. The matrix was fortified with PCB congeners and extracted by an automated solid phase extraction system using C18 sorbent. The extracts were analyzed at two ion source temperatures, 230 and 300 degrees C. The use of high ion source temperature increased the abundances of high-mass ions, and the response factors in SIM mode for PCBs. An excellent linearity from 0.5 to 100 ng/ml at ion source temperature of 300 degrees C was demonstrated, with a calculated detection limit of 0.1 ng/g serum. Seven replicate fortifications of newborn calf serum, at three spiking levels of 1, 10, and 50 ng/g of serum, gave mean recoveries of 110%, 85%, and 98%, with average relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 5.4%, 7.3%, and 4.7%, respectively.
20204343	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and their derivatives, hydroxylated (OH) and methoxylated (MeO) PBDEs and methylsulfonylated (MeSO(2)) PCBs, were measured in sera of eight bird species collected from an e-waste recycling region in South China. Concentrations of summation operatorPCBs, ranging from 38 to 1700 ng/g lipid weight (lw), were one to two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of summation operatorPBDEs (0.64-580 ng/g lw). The significantly positive relationship between PCB and PBDE concentrations suggested a similar pathway of exposure to these compounds. Compared with muscle in birds, serum might prefer to accumulate and/or retain less brominated/chlorinated congeners. 3-OH-BDE47 and 2'-OH-BDE68 were detected in more than 80% of the collected bird serum samples (range: not detectable (nd) to 13 and nd to 7.8 ng/g lw, respectively). The other three OH-PBDE congeners (4'-OH-BDE-17, 6-OH-BDE47, and 4'-OH-BDE-49) and two MeO-PBDE congeners (3-MeO-BDE47 and 6-MeO-BDE47) were occasionally detected in bird sera at concentrations ranging from nd to 2.5 ng/g lw. Both natural sources and metabolic transformation of PBDEs could contribute to the presence of these PBDE derivatives in the birds. The two MeSO(2)-PCB congeners (4-MeSO(2)-CB49 and 4-MeSO(2)-CB101) under investigation were detected at respective concentration ranges of nd to 12 and nd to 0.68 ng/g lw. 4-MeSO(2)-CB101 exhibited the highest concentration among the nine PCB and PBDE derivatives studied, indicating that biotransformation via the mercapturic acid pathway of PCBs might have occurred in the studied bird species.
9339742	Earlier studies have shown that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) do not prevent ovulation, fertilization and implantation, but exposure of female mink during gestation caused fetal death. To understand this phenomenon, 30 PCB-exposed female mink and 30 controls were mated or induced to ovulate without fertilization by treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and correlations were measured between reproductive, morphological and endocrine parameters. The exposure to PCB (Aroclor 1254) started before ovulation. Equal numbers of animals from each group were killed on days 10, 17 and 26 post-coitum or on GnRH-injection days. Plasma concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol-17beta and oestrone sulphate in sampled blood were then measured. Ovaries, uteri and placentae were examined histologically. Compared with controls, exposure to PCB during the reproductive season resulted in significantly smaller uterine glandular diameters before implantation or at the end of the experiment in both mated and GnRH-treated mink. The GnRH treatment increased the sizes of the ovarian corpora lutea and oesterone sulphate 10 days after treatment but the increase in uterine glandular diameter was significant only in GnRH-treated control animals. Both GnRH-treated and mated PCB-exposed groups displayed a peak in oesterone sulphate concentration that was not observed in any of the control groups. Possible actions of PCB are discussed. The observed histological and hormonal changes in the mated PCB-exposed group did not prevent implantation. Exposure to PCB increased fetal mortality. This effect was associated with an effect on placental development.
15608140	The present study was performed to compare the metabolite profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the liver and serum of rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs after exposure to a PCB mixture, Kanechlor 500 (100 mg/kg, i.p.). The percentage of contribution of major PCB residues in the liver 5 days after exposure indicated that nonplanar PCBs with 2,4- or 2,3,4-chlorine substitution were more abundant in the liver in the order rats (43% of total PCBs) > hamsters (20%) > guinea pigs (11%), whereas coplanar PCBs with 4-, 3,4-, or 3,4,5-chlorine substitution were predominant in guinea pigs (61%), followed by hamsters and rats (both 26%). The hepatic concentrations of methylsulfonyl metabolites (MeSO(2)-CBs) were higher in the order guinea pigs > rats > hamsters. Whereas hamsters formed minute amounts of MeSO(2)-CBs from 2,5-dichloro-substituted PCBs, guinea pigs formed higher levels of meta-MeSO(2)-CBs derived from 2,3,6-trichloro-substituted PCBs. In contrast, the serum concentrations of phenolic PCBs were higher in the order hamsters > rats > guinea pigs. Metabolites were predominated by 4-OH-2,3,5,3',4'-pentaCB (89% contribution) for rats, 3-OH-2,4,5,2',4'-pentaCB (56%) for guinea pigs, and dihydroxylated metabolites (39%) for hamsters. The reduced elimination of coplanar PCBs and the specific distribution of MeSO(2)- and phenolic PCBs may have implications for the differences in sensitivity to PCB toxicity among rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters.
15346180	A trace analytical method is presented for the analysis of hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites (HO-PCBs) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in human plasma. The described methodology is a modification of a previously validated method used for PCB and organochlorine pesticide analysis. The modified method enables the combined analysis of phenolic and neutral halogenated compounds. A tandem Florisil column is used for separating the HO-PCBs and PCP from the neutral fraction, instead of the more common chemical partitioning. In the same step the neutral fraction is purified for GC analysis. The extraction of the HO-PCBs and PCP was found to be highly dependent on sufficient acidification of the sample and the polarity of the extracting solvent. Analysis of plasma samples gave recovery rates for (13)C(6)-PCP and (13)C(12)-4-HO-CB 187 of 64 and 72%, respectively. The limit of detection ranged between 2-20 pg g(-1) plasma for the HO-PCBs and 5 pg g(-1) plasma for PCP. No matrix interferences were observed in the chromatograms. In plasma samples (n = 15) from the native Chukchi people in Uelen (Russian Arctic), a population with high PCB exposure, the median ratio of sum HO-PCBs to sum PCBs was as high as 0.4 and the sum HO-PCBs and PCBs were significantly correlated (r(2) > 0.7, p < 0.01). The median sum HO-PCBs (10 congeners) was 5920 pg g(-1) plasma with 4-HO-CB 107 as the dominating congener (median: 1670 pg g(-1) plasma). The median PCP level was measured at 642 pg g(-1) plasma.
14587904	Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) blubber (n = 20) and plasma (n = 19) samples were collected during the 1997 to 2000 Inuit subsistence harvests in Barrow, Alaska, USA, to quantify the concentrations of methylsulfone (MeSO2)-containing and hydroxylated (OH) polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) metabolites in this cetacean. The distribution of MeSO2-PCBs in blubber was dominated by 4-MeSO2-substituted congeners, the most abundant being 4-MeSO2-CB-70, 3'-MeSO2-CB-132, and 4-MeSO2-CB-64. Mean (+/- 1 standard error) sum (sigma) MeSO2-PCBs concentrations in blubber were low (6.23 +/- 0.81 ng g(-1) lipid normalized) compared to concentrations previously reported in other marine mammals. However, similar ratios of MeSO2-PCB metabolites to parent PCB congeners among marine mammals suggest that cytochrome P450 2B-like biotransformation and other necessary enzyme-mediated processes and mechanisms that influence the formation and clearance of MeSO2-PCBs exist in the bowhead whale. Pentachlorophenol was the most abundant halogenated phenolic compound quantified in bowhead plasma (1.55 +/- 0.19 ng g(-1) wet wt). Despite indirect evidence for arene epoxidation of the biphenyl moiety inferred from MeSO2-PCB formation, sumOH-PCB concentrations in bowhead plasma were low (1.52 +/- 0.31 ng g(-1) wet wt) compared to humans and marine mammals and were comprised of only two detectable OH-PCB congeners (4'-OH-CB-130 and 4-OH-CB-187). Further research is required to elucidate the toxicokinetics and distribution of OH-PCBs in this cetacean.
9773843	Lower birth weight and growth retardation has been found in studies with laboratory animals, in children born of mothers exposed to accidental high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and related compounds, and in children born of mothers who consumed PCB-contaminated fish. The effect of background exposure to PCBs and dioxins on birth size and growth in human newborns, however, is still unknown. This study examined birth size and postnatal growth of term newborns in relation to their background PCB and dioxin exposure. Birth weight and weight, length, and head circumference were measured at 10 d and 3, 7, 18, and 42 mo of age in 207 children, of whom 105 were breast-fed and 102 were formula-fed during infancy. The effect of in utero exposure to PCBs on birth size, assessed by cord and maternal plasma PCB levels, was investigated in the whole group. The effect of prenatal PCB exposure on postnatal growth was studied in the formula-fed group, whereas the effect of prenatal as well as lactational exposure to PCBs and dioxins on postnatal growth was studied in the breast-fed group. After adjustment for covariates, cord and maternal plasma PCB levels where both negatively associated with birth weight. Infants with high cord plasma PCB levels (P90 = 0.80 microL) weighed 165 g less compared with infants with low cord plasma PCB levels (P10 = 0.20 microg/L). Cord and maternal plasma PCB levels where both significantly associated with lower growth rate, defined as change in SD score (SDS) of weight, length, and head circumference from birth to 3 mo in the formula-fed group (all p values <0.05). No negative effects of prenatal PCB exposure on growth rate were found from 3 to 42 months of age. Postnatal PCB and dioxin exposure was not negatively associated with growth rate in the breast-fed group. In utero exposure to environmental levels of PCBs is negatively associated with birth weight and postnatal growth until 3 mo of age. Although this growth delay was described in healthy term born infants, intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation are potentially harmful to the developing human and should be avoided by reducing maternal PCB and dioxin body burden, and consequently fetal exposure to these pollutants.
16414171	Considering the presence of polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) in human milk and cord blood, and the estrogenic activity of some congeners, it is conceivable that PBDEs may interact with developing neuroendocrine systems. We investigated effects of 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromo-DE (PBDE 99), a major congener in human milk, on development of brain and reproductive organs, with focus on estrogen target gene expression. Time-pregnant Long Evans rats were subcutaneously injected with PBDE 99 (1 or 10 mg/kg/day), the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (10 mg/kg/day), known to interfere with sexual development, or vehicle, from gestational day (GD) 10 to GD 18. In female offspring, anogenital distance was unaffected by PBDE 99 but increased by Aroclor; puberty (vaginal opening) was not significantly changed. Adult PBDE 99-exposed offspring exhibited unchanged uterine weight but increased ovarian weight. Uterine mRNA levels of estrogen target genes were determined by real-time PCR. Progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA was down-regulated at both PBDE 99 doses, estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), ER beta and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were up-regulated at the lower dose. Aroclor induced different effect patterns. In order to investigate possible changes in sensitivity of target genes to estrogen, some offspring were ovariectomized at 10 weeks of age, s.c. injected with estradiol-17beta (E2, 10 microg/kg) or vehicle at 12 weeks, and sacrificed 6 h later. PBDE 99 dose-dependently reduced the magnitude of IGF-I mRNA induction by E2, and increased the magnitude of ER beta repression. PBDE 99 also influenced baseline levels of PR, IGF-I and ER beta mRNAs in ovariectomized, vehicle-injected controls. These data indicate that developmental exposure to PBDE 99 at doses devoid of general toxicity, affects the regulation of estrogen target genes in uterus. Since PBDE 99 was detected in blood and adipose tissue of adult offspring, these effects may result from interactions with developmental processes, adult functions, or a combination of both.
10784239	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrially produced environmentally persistent compounds. In developed countries all humans have detectable levels in blood and other tissues. PCBs alter thyroid hormone metabolism in animal experiments, and human data suggest background-level exposure may have similar effects in neonates. We evaluated this possible effect among 160 North Carolina children whose in utero PCB exposure was estimated on the basis of the mother's PCB levels in milk and blood, in 1978-1982 (estimated median PCB level in milk at birth, 1.8 mg/kg lipid). Their umbilical cord sera were thawed in 1998 and assayed for total thyroxine, free thyroxine, and thyroid stimulating hormone. We found that PCB exposure was not strongly related to any of the thyroid measures. For example, for a one unit change in milk PCB concentration (mg/kg lipid), the associated multivariate-adjusted increase in thyroid stimulating hormone level was 7% (95% confidence limits (CL) = -6, 21). Despite the possibility of sample degradation, these data suggest that within the range of background-level exposure in the United States, in utero PCB exposure is only slightly related to serum concentration of total thyroxine, free thyroxine, and thyroid stimulating hormone at birth.
8476311	A previously characterized cohort of 115 Great Lakes fish eaters and 95 non-fish-eating regional controls was reexamined in 1989. Levels of blood lead and cadmium and serum PCB and DDT were measured. Lifestyle characteristics, including recent and historic fish consumption, were evaluated as predictors of contaminant levels using multivariate regression analysis. Significantly elevated serum PCB and DDT levels were observed in fish eaters, compared with controls. Historic fish consumption, rather than recent consumption, was identified as the primary predictor of current serum levels. Mean blood lead and cadmium were also significantly higher in fish eaters than in controls. However, the primary predictors of lead and cadmium were behavioral exposures--specifically smoking and self-reported occupational and recreational exposure-rather than fish consumption. These findings illustrate the importance of evaluating a variety of possible sources when investigating human exposure to environmental contaminants.
6415871	High pressure liquid chromatography and graphite tube atomizing atomic absorption spectrometry were used to quantify monomethyl arsonic acid (MMA), dimethyl arsinic acid (DMA), and inorganic arsenic (IA: arsenite plus arsenate) in the urine and feces of male and female hamsters pretreated with a single ip injection of PCB (100 mg/kg) and 4 days later given a single po dose of arsenite (10 mg As/kg). Approximately 17 to 23% and 35 to 63% of the arsenic given was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively, during the 5 days after the administration of arsenic. Both DMA and MMA were found in the urine but only MMA was detected in the feces, as methylated metabolite. Fecal excretion of arsenic was significantly larger in female than in males. PCB influenced the metabolism of arsenic by significantly increasing the proportion of DMA excreted into the urine of female hamsters during the 5 days after the arsenic administration, but did not alter the total amount of arsenic metabolites in any group of male or female hamsters. PCB did not affect the cumulative amounts of fecal arsenic in any group, although the excretion in the PCB-treated group of females reached the maximum level 1 day earlier than in the controls. These results suggest that the metabolism of arsenic may be regulated by certain sex-relating factors which are influenced by PCB.
19054541	An analytical method was developed to measure tri- to octa-chlorinated OH-PCBs and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in the whole blood. Further, baseline data on the levels and profiles of these phenolic compounds in Japanese mammals (human, cat, dog, raccoon dog, and northern fur seal) and birds (black-tailed gull, common cormorant, and jungle crow) were obtained. Eighteen identifiable and fifty unknown peaks of OH-PCBs were detected and the major congeners identified were 4'OH-CB101/120, 4OH-CB107/4'OH-CB108, 4OH-CB146, 4OH-CB178, 4OH-CB187, 4'OH-CB172, 4OH-CB202, and 4'OH-CB199. Relatively higher concentrations of OH-PCBs were found in animal species than humans; OH-PCB levels in dog, raccoon dog, black-tailed gull, and common cormorant blood were one order of magnitude higher than in humans. Penta- to hepta-chlorinated OH-PCB congeners were predominant in human blood, but profiles of OH-PCBs in other animals widely varied by species. Elevated composition of tri- and tetra-chlorinated OH-PCBs in cat blood and octa-chlorinated OH-PCBs in dog and raccoon dog blood were observed. In cat blood, elevated PCP concentration was also found. When concentration ratios of OH-PCBs to PCBs were calculated in all the animal blood, the ratios in dog, raccoon dog, and cat were notably higher than in other species. These results indicate that animals other than humans, especially cat and canine species such as dog and raccoon dog, might be at risk from OH-PCBs.
16009653	This study aimed to develop a physiologically based model for simulating the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in tissue and plasma lipids of rats exposed to PCB mixtures. The model was based on the assumption that the neutral lipid fraction is the only critical determinant of the tissue distribution of PCBs, and that the solubility/retention in other tissue components is negligible. The volumes of the model compartments reflected the volumes of neutral lipids, whereas the flow rates corresponded to those of the neutral lipids in blood. Since the equilibrium ratio of PCB concentrations in neutral lipids of tissues and plasma equals 1, the present modeling approach does not require the use of tissue:blood partition coefficients. Metabolism rates were derived from the best visual fit of the model to the PCB concentrations in hepatic lipids determined on d 41 and 90 in rats exposed to a mixture containing 5, 50, or 500 microg PCBs (118, 138, 153, 170, 180 and 187) per kilogram body weight according to various protocols: (a) every-day dosing, (b) once-a-week dosing, (c) consecutive dosing for 13 d with no further treatment, and (d) 13 irregularly spaced doses. The resulting model consistently simulated the concentrations of PCBs in adipose tissue and plasma lipids of rats exposed according to the four described protocols. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed in this study should be useful as a basis for interpretating blood or plasma lipid concentration data on PCBs collected during biomonitoring studies.
12888206	To increase our analytical throughput for measuring polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides without sacrificing data quality, we have developed and validated a combined PCB/OC pesticide gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) analysis. In a single GC-HRMS analysis, both selected PCBs and OC pesticides are detected and quantified. Previously, this has been difficult, if not impossible, because of the major difference in masses of the most abundant electron-impact ions. However, we have identified slightly less abundant ions to monitor that allow us to successfully combine these analytes into a single analysis without sacrificing any analytical sensitivity or instrument reliability. Consequently, we have been able to double our analytical throughput by modification of mass spectrometric parameters alone. Our new methodology has been validated against our current GC-HRMS method, which entails using two separate injections, one for PCB analysis and one for OC pesticide analysis. The two methods differ by less than 4% overall, with no systematic bias. We used this method to analyze approximately 350 serum samples over a period of several months. We found that our new method was as reliable in automated, overnight runs as our current method.
18599107	As part of a longitudinal cohort study, now in its second decade, we determined PCDDs/Fs dl-PCBs and PBDEs in serum of adolescents with known perinatal PCDD/F exposure. Of the original cohort, 33 adolescents aged 14-19 years, who had been studied previously during their neonatal (n=60), toddler and pre-pubertal period (n=41) agreed to participate in the current follow-up. PCDD/F-, dl-PCB- and PBDE congeners were measured using GC/MS. Current serum levels of PCDD/Fs determined in our cohort were relatively low (mean of 2.2 pg/g) compared to the perinatal exposure. No correlation between perinatal exposure and current serum PCDD/F was found. Planar PCB TEQ levels were 2.2 pg/g. Current summation operatorPBDE levels were 8.7 ng/g lipid. There was one outlier with a summation operatorPBDE of 74 ng/g lipid. The presence of this high value indicates that the exposure pathway is different from PCDD/F and PCB, most likely by dust and food contaminated with dust. Concluding we can say that current PCDD/F levels are quite low compared to the perinatal PCDD/F exposure of the cohort. PBDE levels however are relatively high compared to other European countries, more research on possible health effects of these levels, especially for subjects with outlier concentrations, should be performed.
12586743	Breast-feeding has been linked to slowed postnatal growth. Although the basis for this "weanling's dilemma" is unclear, environmental contaminants in human milk may be of relevance. We studied a Faroese birth cohort of 182 singleton children, born at term in 1994-95. Concentrations of mercury in cord blood and of polychlorinated biphenyls in maternal milk were measured, and duration of breast-feeding was recorded. At 18 months, children who had been exclusively breast-fed for at least 6 months weighed 0.59 kg less [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.03, 1.16 kg] and were 1.50 cm [95% CI = 0.52, 2.47 cm] shorter than those not breast-fed. However, calculated transfer of contaminants from human milk fully explained the attenuated growth. Irrespective of duration of breast-feeding, a doubling of the mercury concentration in cord blood was associated with a decrease in weight at 18 months by 0.19 kg (95% CI = 0.03, 0.35 kg) and in height by 0.26 cm (95% CI = -0.02, 0.55 cm). Weight and height at 42 months showed the same tendencies, but the main effect occurred before 18 months of age. Thus, in communities with increased contaminant exposures, risks associated with lactational transfer of toxicants to the infant must be considered when judging the benefits of prolonged breast-feeding.
20047000	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental contaminants found in the serum of human populations across the globe. A small set of sentinel PCB congeners (IUPAC# 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) commonly sought in human serum are often used as markers of exposure. The Chicago Great Lakes cohort of pregnant African American women was developed to study organochlorine exposure through Great Lakes resources in a pregnant African American population and their children. Comparison of PCB serum concentrations in women reporting mixed race/ethnicity within the cohort shows significant elevations of serum PCB 101 and 118 in women reporting exclusive African American ancestry.Incubations were performed using pooled human liver microsomes followed by individual recombinant human CYP isoform microsomes to identify whether the other sentinel congeners are metabolized by human CYP 450. In human liver microsome metabolism experiments with the sentinel PCB congeners (IUPAC# 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180), only PCB 101 metabolism produced an identifiable metabolite. However, a significant loss of parent compound was observed for PCB 118 incubations with human liver microsomes. The loss of PCB 101 and PCB 118 in microsome experiments indicates they are likely metabolized in human liver. Therefore, CYP 450 mediated metabolic differences may contribute to differences in serum concentrations by race/ethnicity.PCB metabolism has an important impact on toxicity. PCB metabolites have been shown to differ significantly in toxicity profiles relative to parent compounds. Biomonitoring studies of PCB serum levels have correlated with toxicity for the metabolizeable congeners such as PCB 101 and PCB 118. However, measureable amounts of metabolizeable parent congeners such as PCB 101 may not be detectable in the serum of study participants. Because PCB 118 is metabolized, but is also readily found in human serum, it may be a better marker of metabolism related PCB toxicity. Human specific PCB metabolism is difficult to characterize but has important pathophysiological ramifications and deserves further study.
11212945	Previous studies have shown that chicken (Gallus domesticus) embryos are sensitive to the immunotoxic effects of Ah receptor agonists. These chemicals cause atrophy of the thymus gland and bursa of Fabricius, the sites of T- and B-lymphocyte maturation, respectively. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the effects of 3,3,4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) on thymocyte phenotypes (CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8-, CD4-CD8+, TCRalphabeta+, and TCRgammadelta) in chicken embryos, and (2) to compare phenotype alterations with masses and cellularity of lymphoid organs. To simulate exposure in wild avian embryos, chicken eggs were injected with PCB 126 (sunflower oil carrier) into the air cell before incubation. Doses ranged from 0.051 to 0.8 ng/g egg with carrier-injected and noninjected control groups. The thymus and bursa were removed, weighed, and homogenized on d 20 of egg incubation (1 d before hatch). Thymocyte phenotypes were quantified by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies for CD4, CD8, TCRalphabeta (Vbeta1), and TCRgammadelta. Right thymus mass declined with dose, decreasing significantly between 0.32 and 0.8 ng/g to a size 28% lower than controls. Live lymphoid cell numbers in the right thymus dropped markedly (21% lower than controls) between 0.051 and 0.13 ng/g, with a further decrease (35% lower than controls) at higher doses. There was no significant change in the percentage of thymocytes expressing TCRalphabeta. The total number of TCRalphabeta+ thymocytes decreased with dose as a function of the declines in TCRalphabeta+ percentages and total thymocyte numbers. The percentages of all other measured phenotypes were unaltered by PCB 126. The total number of CD4+CD8+ cells, and to a lesser degree CD4-CD8+ cells, decreased in a dose-dependent manner following the pattern of total live thymocytes. The number of viable lymphoid cells in the bursa decreased to 45% lower than controls at 0.13 ng/g and fell to 76% lower than controls at 0.8 ng/g. Lymphoid atrophy occurred at doses that were 8- to 12-fold lower with full-term incubation as compared to exposure only during later stages of incubation, and the lymphoid atrophy was associated with decreased TCRalphabeta+ thymocytes at higher doses. These immunological effects were observed at concentrations of PCB 126 comparable to those found in Great Lakes herring gull eggs, after correcting for interspecies differences in sensitivity to PCB 126.
18093869	Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) can affect neurobehavioral development of infants and children. This effect may be mediated through disruption of thyroid hormone homeostasis. However, epidemiological studies reveal no consistent influence of PCDD/Fs and PCBs on thyroid status and neurodevelopment at environmental background levels. The effects may resolve with time of further decreasing exposure to these compounds. The aim of this study was to find out if there are still effects related to prenatal PCDD/F and PCB observable at the meanwhile decreased levels of exposure by using the same methods which have been applied in similar studies during the last 10 years in Europe. The birth cohort study was initiated in the year 2000 in the industrialized city of Duisburg, Germany. 232 healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited between 2000 and 2002. Dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and six indicator PCBs were analyzed in maternal blood during pregnancy and in maternal milk following extraction and sample clean-up by HRGC/HRMS. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were measured in serum samples of the pregnant women and in cord serum samples by chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Neurological examinations were performed at ages 2 weeks and 18 months using the neurological optimality score (NOS), mental and motor development were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at ages 12 and 24 months. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to describe the association of PCDD/F and PCB in maternal blood or milk with the outcome measurements after adjustment for confounding. Blood levels (n=182) of WHO 2005 toxic equivalents (TEQ) (PCDD/F+PCB) were in the range of 3.8-58.4 pg/glipid base (median: 19.3 pg/glipid base). The corresponding data for human milk (n=149) were 2.6-52.4 pg/glipid base (median: 19.7 pg/glipid base). Multiple regression analysis showed no decrease of thyroid hormones related to WHO 2005 TEQ in blood and milk of mothers and their newborns. Furthermore, no associations between exposure and neurological and developmental measures were observed. This study supports the view that the current decreased exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs does not impair thyroid function of newborns and neurodevelopment of infants until the age of 24 months.
12798172	A sensitive and selective method for the determination of 24 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization (GC-MS-NCI) was applied for the recent needs of occupational exposure in waste incineration. The three most abundant ions were used in determining compounds with at least five chlorine atoms in the PCB molecule. Selecting ions Cl(35) and Cl(37) for di-, tri-, and tetrachlorinated PCBs resulted in reliable quantification of these compounds. The detection limits for the 24 individual compounds varied from 0.01 to 0.08 microg/l. The recovery of the method was 113+/-16%. Stability tests showed no degradation of the compounds studied during 6 weeks. The sum of 24 PCB compounds measured from the sera of workers in a disposal plant was 1.9-10.9 microg/l, and 0.3-3.0 microg/l for controls, respectively. The mean proportion of the low chlorinated PCB compounds (with four or less chlorine atoms) was 20% for workers in the disposal plant and 14% for the controls.
9284533	Subchronic exposure to the PCB congener 77 (PCB 77) and 28 (PCB 28) was previously shown to induce histological changes in the thyroid and in the brain biogenic amines levels, suggesting possible effects on thyroid and reproductive hormone levels. Thus, the effects of a 90-day dietary exposure to PCB 28 or 77 on luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone concentrations were studied in male rats, as well as the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine (T4) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronyl transferase (UDP-GT) activity in both genders. Weanling Sprague Dawley rats were randomly distributed into groups of 10 rats and were fed, for the next 13 weeks, purina lab chow containing 50, 500, 5,000 or 50 000 ppb of PCB 28 or 10, 100, 1000, or 10 000 ppb of PCB 77. The serum concentrations of T4 were decreased in rats of both sexes receiving 1000 ppb or more of PCB 77, and was associated with an increased activity of UDP-GT which reached significance only in the females. There was a tendency for the highest dose of PCB 28 also to decrease serum T4 concentrations in the female rats. None of the PCB treatments significantly altered gonadotropin, TSH, or testosterone concentrations. These results suggest that thyroid functions may be more susceptible or adapt less readily than the pituitary gland and the testes to endocrine disruption caused by PCB congeners.
1398354	Two groups of weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a diet supplemented with either 0.6 or 6 retinol equivalents/g diet were each separated into three further groups receiving 300 mumol 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl/kg body weight, 300 mumol 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl kg/body weight or vehicle only (corn oil). Only the coplanar (3,4)2Cl congener caused a slight reduction in food intake, thymic atrophy and led to a significant decrease in the liver vitamin A storage. The vitamin A lost by the liver was approximately the same in both dietary groups; however an increased renal accumulation of vitamin A was observed in the high vitamin A group. Serum retinol was reduced by (3,4)2Cl treatment but remained unchanged by (2,4,5)2Cl exposure. Total amounts of ascorbic acid and its oxidation products were increased in the liver and in the kidney by both xenobiotics while niacin and thiamine concentrations were lowered by (3,4)2Cl only. Microsomes from vitamin A-deficient rats exhibited a marked decrease in the anisotropy parameter. After (2,4,5)2Cl exposure, an increase in membrane fluidity was observed linked to a decrease in cholesterol/phospholipid (C/P) ratio. Treatment with (3,4)2Cl caused a significant decrease in the index of fluorescence polarization only in the low vitamin A group even if the C/P ratio was enhanced in both dietary groups. This study shows that the polychlorinated biphenyl with the 3-methylcholanthrene-type pattern of induction of cytochrome P-450 has more profound effects on B group vitamins and particularly vitamin A homeostasis than does the phenobarbital-type inducer. Moreover, this situation, which has been found to be similar to that in vitamin A deficiency, is not ameliorated by a high dietary vitamin A intake.
22266287	3,3',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist and most potent dioxin-like PCB congener, significantly alters gene expression, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress in the liver. PON1, an antioxidant and anti-atherogenic enzyme, is produced in the liver and secreted into the blood where it is incorporated into high density lipoprotein (HDL) and protects LDL and cellular membranes against lipid peroxidation. To explore the regulation of PON1, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ip injections of corn oil or 1 μmol/kg or 5 μmol/kg PCB 126 and euthanized up to two weeks afterwards. Serum total and HDL-cholesterol were increased by low dose and decreased by high dose exposure, while LDL-cholesterol was unchanged. PCB 126 significantly increased hepatic PON1 gene expression and liver and serum PON1 activities. Liver and serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels were not elevated except for high dose and long exposure times. Serum antioxidant capacity was unchanged across all exposure doses and time points. This study, the first describing the regulation of gene expression of PON1 by a PCB congener, raises interesting questions whether elevated PON1 is able to ameliorate PCB 126-induced lipid peroxidation and whether serum PON1 levels may serve as a new biomarker of exposure to dioxin-like compounds.
10023802	There is evidence that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners have differential effects on endpoints of neurotoxicity depending on their chemical structure: specifically, that ortho-substituted congeners are neurotoxic whereas coplanar (dioxin-like) congeners are relatively inactive in producing neurotoxic effects. The effects of the coplanar congener 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) on developmental endpoints, hematology, serum biochemistry, and performance on a spatial delayed alternation task were assessed in Long-Evans rats. Dams were dosed with 0, 0.25, or 1.0 microg/kg/day Monday to Friday beginning 5 weeks before and continuing through gestation and lactation. The first 2-week breeding period produced 10, 8, and 13 litters in the three dose groups, respectively. Breeding females from the control and low-dose group that did not conceive were rebred after 76 days of dosing, producing 7 and 6 litters, respectively. Reduction in weight gain from birth to weaning at 21 days of age (DOA) was observed in both dose groups of Cohort 1 but not in Cohort 2. Males in Cohort 1 exhibited a slight decrease in anogenital distance normalized for weight. Changes in hematological and some serum biochemical parameters were observed in the pups at DOA 21 and/or 60. PCB 126 was detected in fat sampled at both DOA 21 and 60. PCB 126 was not detected in brain samples at 60 DOA in any group; analysis of Cohort 2 at DOA 21 revealed levels in the treated group about 1/100 of those in fat. On the spatial delayed alternation task, there was no convincing evidence for impairment as a result of PCB exposure, as assessed by overall accuracy of performance and measures of perseverative and other types of inappropriate responding. These data provide further evidence for the lack of neurotoxicity of dioxin-like PCB congeners. However, assessment of performance on additional behavioral indices is required before definitive conclusions may be drawn.
7850380	Fifty samples of human blood collected in 1992 from the general human population living in five selected areas of the Slovak Republic (the Michalovce, Velký Krtís and Nitra District, Myjava area and Bratislava) were analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (IUPAC Nos. 28, 52, 77, 101, 105, 114, 118, 123, 126, 138 (+163), 153, 156, 157, 167, 169, 180 and 189) and some organochlorine pesticides (HCB, gamma-HCH, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT). PCB levels (the sum of the congeners analysed) in serum lipids averaged for all the samples analysed were 1.79 micrograms.g-1 (range: 0.53-9.20 micrograms.g-1, median: 1.33 micrograms.g-1), HCB 5.38 micrograms.g-1 (0.16-23.20 micrograms.g-1, 4.27 micrograms.g-1), gamma-HCH 0.012 microgram.g-1 (< 0.01-0.18 microgram.g-1), p,p'-DDE 6.05 micrograms.g-1 (1.30-34.80 micrograms.g-1, 4.39 micrograms.g-1) and p,p'-DDT 0.27 microgram.g-1 (< 0.01-0.79 microgram.g-1, 0.23 microgram.g-1). About three times higher levels of PCBs were found in the samples from the district where PCB formulations had been produced (the Michalovce District).
12600866	BACKGROUND: Seafood is an important source of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs), which are essential for normal growth and development. However, the nutritional benefits could be limited by polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination. In particular, inhibition of desaturase activities by PCBs may affect the maintenance of arachidonic acid (AA) status during development. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate AA status in a birth cohort from a fishing community with a high seafood intake and a wide range of PCB exposures. DESIGN: We measured LCP concentrations in paired mother and umbilical cord serum samples obtained from 182 consecutive births in the Faroe Islands, where PCB-contaminated whale blubber forms part of the diet. PCB exposure was determined from maternal concentrations. RESULTS: Serum phospholipid AA concentrations averaged 9.14% and 16.5% (by wt) in maternal and cord serum, respectively. After adjustment for gestational age and concentrations of linoleic, alpha-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids, a decrease in AA concentrations of 0.17% (by wt) (95% CI: 0.03%, 0.31%) and 0.31% (by wt) (95% CI: 0.10%, 0.52%) was seen in maternal and cord serum, respectively, for each doubling of PCB exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Increased PCB exposure was associated with a modest decrease in serum AA concentrations, which is in accordance with the experimental evidence of desaturase inhibition by PCBs. Such interference with LCP utilization could attenuate the beneficial effects of the essential lipids contained in seafood. Because AA is of key importance for growth and development, these results suggest that this possible mechanism for PCB toxicity deserves to be explored. 
11233749	A sample of infants was examined at conceptual age 67 weeks (6-month testing, N=230), and again at conceptual age 92 weeks (12-month testing, N=216) using the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII). Analysis of the results revealed a dose-dependent relationship between total umbilical cord-blood PCB levels and poorer FTII performance at both ages. A similar relationship was observed using a subset of the persistent and heavily chlorinated PCB congeners associated with Lake Ontario fish consumption (septa-, octa-, and nonachlorinated biphenyls) in children tested at 12-months but not at 6-months. These data replicate previous research (Jacobson et al., 1985) which demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship between prenatal PCB exposure and FTII performance in infants of Lake Michigan fisheaters. Analyses of FTII scores with cord-blood DDE and maternal hair methylmercury (MeHg) revealed no significant associations between FTII performance and either of these toxicants. The latter results replicate those of Myers et al., (1995) who found no effect of MeHg on FTII performance in Seychellois infants.
14594106	In 1999 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) released a Draft Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). In reviewing the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, ATSDR (1999) concluded that "The weight of evidence does not support a causal association for PCBs and human cancer at this time." Just 1 year later, in an updated Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), the conclusions of another analysis (ATSDR, 2000) on whether exposure to PCBs might represent a carcinogenic risk to humans had dramatically changed to "Overall, the human studies provide some evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic" and "some of these studies provide meaningful evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic in humans." Because this is a substantially different conclusion than that reached only one year previously, it raises a number of questions that must be considered particularly since "weight of evidence" has a precise meaning in the context of evaluating a body of epidemiological data. The present review addresses the additional scientific data that became available between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations that was of a magnitude to offset the weight of evidence from numerous epidemiological studies that exposure to PCBs was not causally associated with human cancer to a conclusion only 1 year later that there was now "meaningful evidence" that PCBs posed a carcinogenic risk to humans. Also of interest are the criteria upon which this conclusion is based and the distinction between "weight of evidence" and the newer descriptors of "some evidence" and "meaningful evidence." However, as shown in this review, only one relevant study was published between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations and the results of this study were unequivocally supportive of the 1999 conclusion. Because of the continuing controversy surrounding this issue, in this review, all relevant epidemiological data on PCBs are summarized and subjected to another weight of evidence evaluation. This critical review is based on the most recent guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1999a, 2003) for conducting weight-of-evidence evaluations on a body of epidemiological data. Applying a weight-of-evidence evaluation to the PCB epidemiological studies can only lead to the conclusion that there is no causal relationship between PCB exposure and any form of cancer, thereby confirming the conclusions of ATSDR (1999). Also considered is the methodology and logic used by ATSDR (2000) that resulted in overturning the weight of evidence conclusions concerning the human carcinogenicity of PCBs in ATSDR (1999). This issue may have public health and policy implications. It seems appropriate that unbiased evaluations of a body of data, even of controversial issues such as the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, be conducted in a transparent manner following applicable guidelines. The dramatic differences between the conclusions of ATSDR (1999) and ATSDR (2000) do not appear to be consistent with this process.
18547604	In 2006, levels of seven indicator polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) in blood serum of 202 blood donors residing for more than 2 years in five urban areas included in the Czech Human Biomonitoring project were measured by GC/MS/MS method. PCB congeners 138, 153 and 180 accounted for about 97% of the sum of the indicator congeners analyzed. Overall, the median and 95th percentile of the most abundant congener PCB 153 were 438 ng/g lipid and 1079 ng/g lipid, respectively. The highest median levels were found in Uherské Hradiste (669 ng/g lipid) and Ostrava (672 ng/g lipid in males compared to 341 ng/g lipid in females). Serum PCB concentrations were significantly associated with age, gender, place of residence and smoking habit, but not with body mass index and education. The results suggest the importance of PCB body burden in the Czech general population and the existence of hot spots.
23500661	Accumulating evidence shows an association between deregulation of miRNAs and exposure to environmental chemicals; miRNAs play a unique regulatory role in gene expression. Among environmental pollutants, dioxins are a family of compounds that are known to have multiple hazardous effects. Also, in utero exposure of the fetus to dioxins has been shown to cause impaired psychomotor development, decreased immune function and skin disease. miR-191 is a microRNA that has been found to be up-regulated by dioxin in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro. Our study provides the first molecular evidence in vivo of a positive relationship between levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and miR-191 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. miR-191 expression was significantly correlated with blood concentrations of total PCB and, in particular, of 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 169, a coplanar congener). Blood concentrations of PCB 169 correlated significantly with miR-191 expression in pregnant women living in a PCB-polluted area, who underwent therapeutic abortion due to fetal malformations. These data suggest that miRNAs could be potential biomarkers to clarify the mechanisms of environmental disease.
11006359	Previous studies revealed effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other polyhalogenated hydrocarbons on steroid hormone levels and hormone-dependent functions including behavior. In the present study serum concentrations of the vitamin D(3) metabolites 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-D) and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-D) were determined in rat dams and offspring after exposure to a PCB mixture that was reconstituted according to the congener pattern found in human breast milk. Unmated females were exposed to diets adulterated with 0; 5; 20; or 40 mg PCBs/kg diet. Exposure started 50 days prior to mating and was terminated at birth. Gestational exposure reduced serum concentrations of 1,25-D in dams in a dose-dependent manner. Concentration of 25-D was also decreased at the time of delivery, but not at weaning. Determination of 1,25-D in offspring at weaning revealed reductions in both high-exposure groups. Levels of 25-D were diminished only at the highest exposure level. Internal PCB concentrations in adipose tissue and brains exhibited a linear relation to dosages in diet. Concentrations of PCBs in brains were similar in dams and offspring at birth, but decreased at the end of lactation in dams. In offspring, values increased during this period because of continued exposure via the milk. In the adipose tissue, PCB levels were much lower in offspring than in dams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PCB-induced effects on vitamin D(3) metabolites. In dams, reductions were seen even at the lowest exposure level used. Further studies are needed to evaluate the biological significance of these reductions in pregnant dams and possible consequences for the developing offspring.
12876689	A time- and cost-saving method for the congener-specific analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum has been developed and validated. After two fast extraction and clean-up steps, analyses were performed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry with single ion monitoring (GC/SIM-MS), either in electron impact (EI) or electron-capture negative ionization (ECNI) mode. For the determination of dioxin-like congeners, an improvement in EI-MS sensitivity is desirable and use of NI is thus preferred. The procedure was validated for 12 dioxin-like congeners by analyzing spiked samples on three different days and using (13)C(12)-labelled analogues as internal standards. When using an NCI source, the limit of quantification was assessed at 0.01 microg/L, except for PCBs #77 and #81, which cannot be reliably detected below 0.05 microg/L. For the lower chlorinated non-dioxin-like congeners, NI offers less selectivity because of limited fragmentation. Electron impact ionization and electron-capture negative ionization mode can therefore be considered to be complementary for the determination of PCB congeners in the general population.
3143397	A cohort of 16 municipal workers engaged in cleaning oil from old transformers was examined for possible health effects from exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In addition to the evaluation of routine clinical parameters (history, physical examination, liver function tests, serum triglycerides, serum PCB values), a new screening technique for the presence of oncogene proteins in serum using monoclonal antibodies was used to ascertain the potential carcinogenic risk from exposure in these workers. Except for one individual, serum PCB concentrations were found to be relatively low in this cohort, probably due to the observance of appropriate protective precautions. The results of liver function test were within normal limits and serum triglyceride concentrations showed no consistent relation to PCB concentrations. Six individuals, all of whom were smokers, showed abnormal banding patterns for fes oncogene related proteins. The individual with the highest serum PCB concentration also exhibited significantly raised levels of the H-ras oncogene related P21 protein in his serum. These oncogene protein findings may be indicative of an increased risk for the development of malignant disease in these individuals.
10667464	Numerous studies have examined the relationship between organochlorines and breast cancer, but the results are not consistent. In most studies, organochlorines were measured in serum, but levels in breast adipose tissue are higher and represent cumulative internal exposure at the target site for breast cancer. Therefore, a hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Ontario, Canada to evaluate the association between breast cancer risk and breast adipose tissue concentrations of several organochlorines. Women scheduled for excision biopsy of the breast were enrolled and completed a questionnaire. The biopsy tissue of 217 cases and 213 benign controls frequency matched by study site and age in 5-year groups was analyzed for 14 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, total PCBs, and 10 other organochlorines, including p,p'-1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the magnitude of risk. While adjusting for age, menopausal status, and other factors, odds ratios (ORs) were above 1.0 for almost all organochlorines except five pesticide residues. The ORs were above two in the highest concentration categories of PCB congeners 105 and 118, and the ORs for these PCBs increased linearly across categories (Ps for trend < or =0.01). Differences by menopausal status are noted especially for PCBs 105 and 118, with risks higher among premenopausal women, and for PCBs 170 and 180, with risks higher among postmenopausal women. Clear associations with breast cancer risk were demonstrated in this study for some PCBs measured in breast adipose tissue.
16291567	Pregnant does (10 goats/group) were dosed orally either with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153 (98 microg/kg body weight/d) or PCB 126 (ng/kg body weight/d) dissolved in corn oil or with corn oil only (control group) from gestation day (GD) 60 until delivery. An additional group (n = 5) of pregnant does received the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES; 0.4 microg/kg body weight/d) by intramuscular injection using the same treatment schedule as for the PCB groups. Blood samples for immune analysis were collected at wk 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 of age. The effects of perinatal PCB exposure on postnatal humoral immune responses were examined by assessing the levels of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulins to specific microbes at wk 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 of age, and immune responses following immunization of kids at 2 wk of age. PCB 153 exposure suppressed maternal and neonatal immunity, as demonstrated by reduced transfer of maternal IgG and specific antibodies to the environmental microbes Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mannheimia haemolytica, and reovirus (REO-1). Furthermore, PCB 153 reduced the level of maternal antibodies to Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and equine influenza virus (EIV-1) in the newborn kids. The antibody response against EIV-1 was significantly higher in PCB 153-exposed kids 2 wk following immunization. PCB 126 exposure reduced the levels of maternal antibodies to REO-1. In contrast, gestational exposure to PCB 126 increased the concentrations of maternal antibodies to tetanus toxoid. No differences from controls in plasma total IgG levels at birth or colostrum IgG concentrations were observed in the PCB 126-treated does. However, a significant reduction in IgG levels from GD 60 until delivery was found in this group. Gestational exposure to DES reduced the concentrations of maternal antibodies against A. pyogenes, M. haemolytica, M. avium Paratuberculosis, and REO-1. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to low doses of PCB 126 and PCB 153 affects the maternal immunity in kids. The difference in responses between PCB 126 and PCB 153 treatment groups may strengthen the hypothesis that PCBs mediate immunotoxic effects through both AhR-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The observation that the effects produced by PCB 153 resembled those produced by DES raises the question of whether this congener may modulate immunity by estrogenic mechanisms.
2109552	Serum for reference pools of in vivo polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was obtained from four goats that had received one dose (100 mg kg-1) of a selected technical Aroclor (AR) (1016, 1242, 1254 or 1260) and were allowed to recover for 30 d. These pools were used to assess the differences in an analytical method that determines and quantifies PCBs using packed-column gas chromatography (PCGC) (quantified on the basis of mean mass percent. data for grouped PCB peaks) and capillary-column gas chromatography (CCGC) (quantified on the basis of percent. composition data for specific congeners). With CCGC, results were statistically significantly different (p less than or equal to 0.0002) from results with PCGC for ARs 1016, 1242 and 1254 but not for AR 1260 (p = 0.23). When comparing these gas chromatographic methods using bovine serum spiked in vitro with the same ARs at 17-25 p.p.b., it was found that the methods were not statistically significantly different for any of the ARs (p = 0.30-0.92). Levels of serum PCB determined by the two methods for 12 persons, divided into two groups according to exposure, were compared using the paired t-test. Group 1 consisted of three persons with dietary and/or environmental exposure; one with dietary and/or environmental exposure in addition to occupational exposure dating back 20 years. Group 2 consisted of eight persons with recent occupational exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
9210724	During 1978 and 1979, an episode of poisoning from ingestion of rice oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans occurred in central Taiwan. We followed-up children who had been born between June 1978 and March 1985, as well as matched unexposed children. The mothers of exposed children had consumed contaminated oils before the children were born. In 1993, otolaryngologists examined the middle ear of each child with a pneumatic otoscope, and they measured the middle-ear pressure by tympanometry with a Rion RS20 impedance audiometer. The exposed children had a significantly higher prevalence of middle-ear diseases than their matched controls. The exposed children who had ear diseases had higher serum levels of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachloro- and 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachloro-dibenzofurans than the children who did not have similar diseases. Therefore, in this study, children exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans had a higher incidence of middle-ear diseases than their controls.
15667840	In the context of a monitoring program, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were quantified in the blood of 10 year old children at four different demographic regions in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a highly industrialised federal state in South West Germany. DDE, HCB, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180 were measured in 1996/1997, 1998/1999, 2000/2001 and 2002/2003 in individual samples of about 400 children per year. PCDD/PCDFs and some relevant coplanar PCBs were determined in pooled samples from children in seven cycles from 1993 to 2003. Blood concentrations of the investigated compounds decreased in that time period by a factor of 2-4 with the exception of most PCDFs. The concentrations of POPs in the blood of the children were distinctly lower than the concentrations reported for adults. Breast feeding was associated with about 30% higher median concentrations of DDE, HCB, PCBs and a 30% increase for mean PCDD/PCDF concentrations. Concerning demographic differences, significant lower concentrations of HCB, PCBs and PCDD/PCDFs could be seen in children from Mannheim compared to the region of Aulendorf. About 10-20% higher concentrations were found in boys compared to girls for HCB, indicator PCBs and PCDD/PCDFs. The pattern of non-ortho and mono-ortho PCBs in the blood of children was similar to the pattern reported for mother's milk, and PCB 126 and PCB 156 contributed about 70% to the toxicity of dioxin-like PCBs and about one-third to total TEQ including PCDD/PCDFs.
2560062	Guinea-pigs treated by gavage with a total dose of 100 mg polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB: Clophen A50) during Days 17-61 of gestation had higher plasma concentrations of 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin F-2 alpha, oestrone sulphate and oestradiol-17 beta during the later stages of gestation than did vehicle-treated guinea-pigs. No changes were observed in plasma progesterone concentrations. Our results provide no support for the hypothesis that an enzyme-induced decrease in progesterone concentrations is the main cause of the fetal death observed in PCB-treated guinea-pigs.
14514954	The developmental and neurobehavioral effects of gestational and lactational exposure to a mixture of 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 11 organochlorine pesticides was examined and compared against the commercial PCB mixture Aroclor 1254. The mixture was based on blood levels reported in Canadian populations living in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence basin. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed orally with 0.013, 0.13, 1.3, or 13 mg/kg of the chemical mixture or 15 mg/kg of Aroclor 1254 from gestation day (GD) 1 to postnatal day (PND) 23. The highest mixture dose decreased maternal gestation and lactation body weight, and produced high mortality rates (80% overall) and reductions in offspring weight that persisted to adulthood. Aroclor 1254 produced smaller but persistent decreases in offspring weight without affecting maternal weight or offspring mortality. Aroclor 1254 and 13 mg/kg of the mixture produced comparable decreases in maternal and offspring serum T4 levels and comparable alterations to maternal thyroid morphology. Aroclor 1254 delayed the righting reflex and ear opening, accelerated eye opening, and reduced grip strength at PNDs 10-14. The mixture at 13 mg/kg delayed negative geotaxis in addition to delaying righting reflex and ear opening and reducing grip strength but had no effect on eye opening. Lower mixture doses (0.13 and 1.3 mg/kg) also delayed ear opening but affected no other parameters. Developmental exposure to the chemical mixture was found to be more toxic than exposure to Aroclor 1254 and produced a different profile of effects on early neurodevelopment. This PCB/organochlorine pesticide mixture affects mortality, growth, thyroid function, and neurobehavioral development in rodents.
22960060	Maternal exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may result in adverse health effects in their children. In Japan in 1968, an accidental human exposure to rice oil contaminated with PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs, led to the development of Yusho disease. Yusho mothers delivered descendants with low birth weights and hyperpigmented skin and mucosa, which are characteristic of fetal Yusho disease (FYD). The Yusho cohort was used to evaluate the effect of maternal exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs on the development of FYD. Blood samples, obtained from 64 Yusho mothers (117 descendants: 10 with FYD and 107 without FYD), were analyzed for congeners of seven PCDDs, 10 PCDFs, and four coplanar PCBs. We investigated the association between the maternal estimated blood levels of dioxins at delivery and the risk of fetal Yusho disease. We also studied the differences in dioxin blood levels in 24 mother-descendant pairs (5 with FYD and 19 without FYD). The estimated levels of total PCDD TEQ, total PCDF TEQ, total coplanar PCB TEQ, and total TEQ in the maternal blood at delivery were associated with significantly increased risk of FYD. The odds ratios, which present the risk of FYD for a 10-fold increase in blood dioxin, were largest for 1,2,3,6,7,8-HexaCDD (odds ratio=28.6, 95% confidence interval=1.67-489.9, p=0.02). The levels of 1,2,3,6,7,8-HexaCDD in both the Yusho mothers and their descendants with FYD were higher than the levels in those without FYD. These findings suggest that 1,2,3,6,7,8-HexaCDD is the most important causative congener for the development of FYD.
11245392	Antibody-mediated immune function in adult and recently fledged (30 to 33 d old) American kestrels (Falco sparverius) was examined in birds exposed directly, or only in ovo, to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In 1998, 9 mature male and 9 female kestrels were fed PCBs, whereas 9 females and 10 males served as controls. A mixture of Aroclors 1248:1254:1260 suspended in safflower oil was injected into the kestrels' food items, while in control diets only the same volume of oil was added. The dosage of PCBs was approximately 7 mg/kg kestrel/d, beginning in March 1998 and continuing for 120 d. In 1998, the antibody-mediated immune response was stimulated by immunization and booster vaccinations of the kestrels using a nonpathogenic antigen, dinitrophenol-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH). In 1999, offspring from three treatment groups based upon maternal exposure to PCBs were similarly tested for their antibody response. None of these mothers was vaccinated with DNP-KLH the previous year. The maternal groups were: (1) exposed to PCBs in 1998 for 120 d, (2) exposed in ovo in 1998 (i.e., mothers were produced by PCB-exposed parents), or (3) unexposed to PCBs. Serum antibody levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In 1998, PCB-exposed adult females had a significantly higher antibody response than did controls, whereas adult males exposed to PCBs had significantly suppressed antibody production. For the nestlings produced in 1999, maternal treatment significantly affected antibody response. Generally, the antibody response in the nestlings was much lower than that seen in adult kestrels. Yet both male and female offspring from mothers that had been fed PCBs the previous year had significantly higher postbooster anti-DNP-KLH titers than control and in ovo-exposed maternal groups, thus mimicking the response seen in the adult females the previous year. These sex-specific responses in PCB-exposed birds provide further evidence of the endocrine-disrupting behavior of PCBs. Both suppression and stimulation of the antibody response are undesirable because this indicates that the immune system is not able to respond normally to challenges by infectious or other disease-causing agents.
6403003	One hundred seventeen patients had polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) poisoning. Thirty-nine patients were male; 78 were female. The primary ocular manifestations were profuse discharge from the eyes (80.5%), swelling and pigmentation of the upper lids (58.9%), abnormal pigmentation of conjunctivae (66.6%), and hypersecretion and swelling of the meibomian glands (70.1%). The severity of these changes were directly related to the PCB concentration in the blood. Particularly, heavy pigmentation of conjunctivae, abnormal cystic formation, and hypersecretion of the meibomian glands occurred in those patients whose blood PCB concentration was greater than 41 parts per billion. Ocular signs not only provide early signs for diagnosis, but also serve to indicate the severity of PCB poisoning.
20378148	Concentrations and congener specific profiles of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorine residues were measured in 22 pooled blood samples representing 66 children from both polluted areas (E-waste recycling region) and case control areas in Zhejiang province, China. To our knowledge, this is the first report on these pollutants in the blood of Chinese children. The mean concentrations of [summation operator]PCDD/Fs, [summation operator]PCBs, [summation operator]PBDEs, HCB and pp'-DDE in pooled blood samples from polluted areas (Luqiao) were 206+/-157 pg g(-1) lipid, 40.6+/-7.01 ng g(-1) lipid, 32.1+/-17.5 ng g(-1) lipid, 14.6+/-20.1 ng g(-1) lipid and 108+/-21.8 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. WHO-TEQ-2005 for PCBs and PCDD/Fs were 11.9+/-4.62 pg g(-1) lipid and 10.3+/-6.39 pg g(-1) lipid, respectively. The results showed that PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorine residues in the E-waste recycling area were significantly (P<0.001) higher than the case control areas. High levels of PCDD/Fs were detected in the case control area (Longyou), where Na-PCP had been widely sprayed to prevent snailborne schistosomiasis. The contamination levels and profiles were compared with those documented in previous publications.
21903210	We examined biomarkers of selenium status (whole blood Se; serum Se; glutathione peroxidase activity) and thyroid status (concentrations and ratios of thyroxine, T4; tri-iodothyronine, T3; albumin) in polar bears to assess variations among cohorts, and relationships to circulating concentrations of contaminants. Concentrations of total mercury (Hg) in whole blood were similar among cohorts (prime aged males and females, older animals, ages≥16 years, and young animals, ages 1-5 years; 48.44±35. 81; p=0.253). Concentrations of sum of seven polychlorinated biphenyls (∑PCB7) in whole blood were greater in females (with and without cubs, 26.44±25.82 ng/g ww) and young (26.81±10.67 ng/g ww) compared to males (8.88±5.76 ng/g ww, p<0.001), and significantly related to reduced body condition scores (p<0.001). Concentrations of Se and albumin were significantly greater in males than females (whole blood Se, males, 42.34 pmol/g ww, females, 36.25±6.27 pmol/g ww, p=0.019; albumin, males, 4.34±0.34 g/dl, females, 4.10±0.29 g/dL, p=0.018). Glutathione peroxidase activity ranged from 109.1 to 207.8 mU/mg hemoglobin, but did not differ significantly by sex or age (p>0.08). Thyroid hormones were greater in females (solitary females and females with cubs) compared to males (p<0.001). Biomarkers of Se status and concentrations of T3 were significantly positively related to Hg in all prime aged polar bears (p<0.03). Albumin concentrations were significantly positively related to total TT4, and significantly negatively related to concentrations of ∑PCB7 (p<0.003). Total thyroxine (TT4) was significantly negatively associated with blood concentrations of ∑PCB7 in solitary females (p=0.045). These data suggest that female polar bears were more susceptible to changes in blood-based biomarkers of selenium and thyroid status than males. Further classifications of the physiologic states of polar bears and repeated measures of individuals over time are needed to accurately assess the biological impact of combined toxicant exposures.
9828301	PCDD/PCDF/PCB concentrations were measured in samples from four mothers (at delivery and during lactation) and their infants (at birth and the end of first year of life). For two of these mothers it was the second delivery and breast-feeding period, and additional data were available from first lactation period and the first-born infant at the age of 11 to 12 months. Five of the six infants were fully breast-fed for at least 17 weeks. In four of them a distinct PCDD/PCDF/PCB accumulation was observed at the end of the first year of life: concentrations in blood fat were 1.5 to 3.6 times higher than maternal levels measured at the same time. Due to decreasing maternal body burdens during lactation, PCDD/PCDF concentrations at 11 to 12 months of life were only about half as high in the second infant as in the first one at the same age. During second pregnancy, no important change of the concentrations was observed in maternal blood.
23724965	BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) has been suggested to negatively affect birth weight although epidemiological evidence is still inconclusive. We investigated if prenatal exposure to PCBs and PBDEs is related to birth weight in a Swedish population with background exposure. METHODS: Breast milk was sampled during the third week after delivery from first-time mothers in Uppsala county, Sweden 1996-2010 (POPUP cohort) (N = 413). Samples were analysed for di-ortho PCBs (CB-138, 153, 180) and tetra- to hexa- brominated PBDEs (BDE-47, 99, 100, 153). Simple and multiple linear regression models were used to investigate associations between lipid-adjusted, ln-transformed PCB and PBDE concentrations, and birth weight. Covariates included in the multivariate regression model were PCB and PBDE exposure, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, education, smoking, gender of the infant and gestational length. The effect of including fish consumption was also investigated. RESULTS: In the multivariate model, prenatal exposure to di-ortho PCBs was significantly associated with increased birth weight (β = 137; p = 0.02). The result did not change when gestational length was added to the model. An inverse association between PBDE(4) (sum of BDE-47, -99, -100 and -153) and birth weight was observed in the multivariate model including gestational length (β = -106; p = 0.04). Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain during pregnancy were important confounders of the association between di-ortho PCBs and birth weight. The associations were not alleviated after adjustment for fish consumption, a major source of PCB and PBDE exposure. The observed associations were stronger for boys than for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that prenatal exposure to di-ortho PCBs and PBDE(4) may influence birth weight in different directions, i.e. PCB exposure was associated with higher birth weight and PBDE exposure with lower birth weight. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain during pregnancy were important confounders that may hide positive association between di-ortho PCB exposure and birth weight if they are not included in the statistical model. We speculate that even small PCB- and PBDE-induced shifts in the distribution of birth weight may influence future public health in populations with background exposure. 
22974126	Epidemiological and laboratory studies link polychlorinated biphenyls and their metabolites to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Several neurotoxic PCB congeners are chiral and undergo enantiomeric enrichment in mammalian species, which may modulate PCB developmental neurotoxicity. This study measures levels and enantiomeric enrichment of PCB 95 and its hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) in adult female C57Bl/6 mice following subchronic exposure to racemic PCB 95. Tissue levels of PCB 95 and OH-PCBs increased with increasing dose. Dose-dependent enantiomeric enrichment of PCB 95 was observed in brain and other tissues. OH-PCBs also displayed enantiomeric enrichment in blood and liver, but were not detected in adipose and brain. In light of data suggesting enantioselective effects of chiral PCBs on molecular targets linked to PCB developmental neurotoxicity, our observations highlight the importance of accounting for PCB and OH-PCB enantiomeric enrichment in the assessment of PCB developmental neurotoxicity.
15935445	BACKGROUND: Different PCB congeners and different mixtures of congeners have been demonstrated to have different biological actions. More complete characterization of congener profiles in exposure sources may assist in predicting health outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-six (36) polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were measured by gas chromatography isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) in 314 serum samples from Native Americans in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. Five dietary groups were established based on the quantity and species of fish consumed and the waters from which the fish were caught. Multivariate statistical methods were able to resolve gender and dietary differences in PCB homologue and PCB congener patterns. RESULTS: Females had higher proportions of lower chlorinated homologues, including a consistently higher proportion of pentaCB 118. The relative presence of the very labile and volatile PCB 18, above 1% of the total PCB in females from the minimal fish consumption and "other" groups, suggests possible exposure to PCBs in the atmosphere. The dietary group consuming predatory fishes from Lakes Michigan and Superior had the highest serum concentrations of total PCB (mean of 3.1 ng/ml) and the most distinct congener profile. The two dietary groups least dependent on fishing or fishing mostly from inland lakes (non-Great Lakes) had the lowest total PCB concentrations, both with means of 1.4 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: These serum PCB concentrations were less than those found in earlier studies of fish consumers in the Great Lakes region and may reflect the decrease in PCBs in these lakes. 
19345979	In Brescia a PCB production plant polluted soil and forage of the surrounding fields and caused a significant contamination of meat and milk of the cattle fed with local forage. This in turn induced elevated blood levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the consumers. The contamination levels and profiles measured in the perirenal fat, in the liver and in the milk of the overall 28 contaminated bovines are reported. TEQ levels varied from 30 to 81 pg WHO(2005)-TEQ g(-1) (38-103 pg WHO(1997)-TEQ) for perirenal fat, from 107 to 138 pg WHO(2005)-TEQ g(-1) fat (128-168 pg WHO(1997)-TEQ) for liver and from 45 to 50 pg WHO(2005)-TEQg(-1) fat (56-65pg WHO(1997)-TEQ) for milk; all these values are roughly tenfold higher than the European limits. Non-ortho dioxin-like (dl)PCBs are by far the largest contributors to TEQ and PCDF contribution also largely prevail over PCDD's; both these features are also present in both the contaminated forages and in the serum of consumers of contaminated food. The indicator PCB levels are in the following ranges: 226-664 ng g(-1) for perirenal fat; 929-1822 ng g(-1) fat for liver; 183-477 ng g(-1) fat for milk; their level is about 100 times higher than the regional background. The liver samples displayed an overall TEQ several times higher than the perirenal fat from either the same animal or the same pool of animals; the increase in liver concentration was significantly higher for PCDD and PCDF congeners than for dlPCBs, and it was maximum for OCCD.
15025504	In the present study, a series of 32 hydroxy- and dihydroxy-polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) and PCB-derived quinones were prepared and evaluated for their in vitro potencies to downregulate gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in well-established liver and mammary cell models. The rat liver epithelial cell line WB-F344 was used for in vitro determination of GJIC inhibition; the AhR-inducing activity was determined in the rat hepatoma H4IIE.Luc cells stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene; ER-mediated activity was measured in two breast carcinoma cell lines, MVLN and T47D.Luc, stably transfected with luciferase under the control of estrogen responsive element. Acute inhibition of GJIC, potentially associated with tumor promotion, was detected after treatment with all OH-PCBs under study, with the persistent OH-PCBs being the strongest ones. Several compounds were found to significantly induce the AhR-mediated activity, including 4'-OH-PCB 79, a metabolite of PCB 77, and 2-(4'-chloro)- and 2-(3',4'-dichloro)-1,4-benzoquinones and 1,4-hydroquinones. Low molecular weight OH-PCBs, such as 3'-hydroxy, 4'-, and 3',4'-dihydroxy-4-chlorobiphenyl, elicited significant estrogenic activity and potentiated effect of 17beta-estradiol. Antiestrogenic potencies, determined in the presence of 17beta-estradiol, were found for persistent 4-OH-PCB 187, 4-OH-PCB 146, and some low chlorinated PCB derivatives. However, no apparent association between induction of AhR activity and antiestrogenicity was observed. The majority of the OH-PCBs suppressed the 17beta-estradiol response only at cytotoxic concentrations. Spearman's rank correlations were calculated for these biological data and the physicochemical descriptors, hydrophobicity (log P), molar volume, pKa, log D, and dihedral angle. Significant correlations were found between potency to downregulate GJIC and log P and molar volume (R = -0.7, p < 0.0001). Antiestrogenic effects were also negatively correlated with hydrophobicity and molar volume. No significant correlations among other biological end points and the physicochemical descriptors were observed for the entire set of compounds. These results show that oxygenated PCB metabolites are capable of multiple adverse effects, including gap junction inhibition, AhR-mediated activity, and (anti)estrogenicity. The inhibition of GJIC by OH-PCBs represents a novel mode of action of both the lower chlorinated and the persisting high molecular weight OH-PCBs.
18087602	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported blood levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the U.S. population. Information about neonatal levels and about the relationship to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposures is limited. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to characterize levels and determinants of fetal exposure to PBDEs and PCBs among newborns from Baltimore, Maryland. METHODS: We analyzed umbilical cord blood for eight PBDEs and 35 PCBs from infants delivered at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Maternal and infant characteristics were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of cord serum samples had quantifiable levels of at least one PBDE congener, and > 99% had at least one detectable PCB congener. PBDE concentrations in cord blood were similar to those reported in other studies from North America. Strong correlations were observed within but not across PCB and PBDE classes. Multivariate models showed that many factors independently predicted exposure to BDE-47, BDE-100, and BDE-153 and CB-118, CB-138/158, CB-153, and CB-180. Generally, infants of Asian mothers had lower PBDE and PCB levels, and infants of smokers had higher levels. Increased maternal body mass index was associated with lower levels of PCBs but not PBDEs. Levels of PCBs but not PBDEs were lower in births from married and multiparous mothers. Increased maternal age was associated with higher PCB levels but lower PBDE levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the factors we investigated were independent predictors of both PBDE and PCB levels, in some cases the direction of associations was different. More research is needed to better understand the sources and pathways of PBDE exposure. 
17189629	UNLABELLED: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and some organochlorine pesticides, which continue to be measurable in a high proportion of blood samples from the general population, have been found to alter thyroid hormone levels in animals and humans. However, studies of these relationships in adult men are limited and results across studies have been inconsistent. In the present study, we measured serum levels of 57 PCB congeners, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p(')-DDE, a stable metabolite of DDT), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), as well as free T(4), total T(3), and TSH, in 341 adult men recruited from an infertility clinic from 2000 to 2003. In multivariate linear regression, there were positive associations between p,p(')-DDE and both free T(4) and total T(3), and an inverse association between p,p(')-DDE and TSH. Conversely, for PCBs there was only a suggestive inverse association between PCB 153 and total T(3) when potential confounding variables were considered. However, when results were additionally adjusted for p,p(')-DDE, inverse associations with T(3) were significant for PCB 138, PCB 153, sum of PCBs and three different PCB groupings, and HCB, while the positive associations between p,p(')-DDE and T(3) also remained. In conclusion, serum concentrations of PCBs, p,p(')-DDE, and HCB were associated with circulating thyroid hormone levels in adult men. ABBREVIATIONS: BMI, body mass index; CYP, cytochrome P450; DDT, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane; HCB, hexachlorobenzene; MDL, method detection limit; NHANES, national health and nutrition examination survey: p,p(')-DDE, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl; T(3), triiodothyronine; T(4), thryoxine; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone (thyrotrophin); US, United States. 
6401943	Reported consumption of Lake Michigan sport fish was examined in relation to the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in biological samples provided by a sample of maternity patients. Fish consumption was correlated with PCB levels in maternal serum and milk but not in cord serum. PCB levels in serum increased with age, but were unrelated to social class, parity, or weight. Women who breast fed consumed as much fish as women who did not and their maternal and cord sera PCB levels were similar.
21703328	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain ubiquitously present in human lipids despite the ban on their production and use. Their presence can be chemically monitored in peripheral blood samples of the general population. We tested whether in vitro exposure to different PCB congeners induced different gene expression profiles in peripheral blood cells. We have isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from whole blood of 8 healthy individuals and exposed these cells in vitro to individual non-dioxin-like (NDL)-PCB congeners (PCB52, 138 or 180; 10μM) or dioxin-like (DL)-PCB congener PCB126 (1μM) during 18h. Differential gene expression response was measured using Agilent whole-human genome microarrays. Two-way ANOVA analysis of the data showed that both gender and PCB exposure are important factors influencing gene expression responses in blood cells. Hierarchical cluster analysis of genes influenced by PCB exposure, revealed that DL-PCB126 induced a different gene expression response compared to the NDL-PCBs. Biological interpretation of the results revealed that exposure to PCB126 induced the AhR signaling pathway, whereas the induction of nuclear receptor pathways by the NDL-PCBs was limited in blood cells. Nevertheless, molecular responses of blood cells to individual PCB congeners revealed significantly expressed genes that play a role in biological functions and processes known to be affected by PCB exposure in vivo. Observed gene expression changes in this in vitro model were found to be related to hepatotoxicity, immune and inflammatory response and disturbance of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis.
16583258	Concentrations and profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in three tissues of adult snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina serpentina) from six locations in the Ohio Basin of Lake Erie to characterize tissue variation and geographic trends. The locations included the Ohio Areas of Concern, i.e., the Ashtabula, Black, and Maumee Rivers; the Ottawa River near Toledo; and two reference sites. Mean total PCBs were greatest in turtles from the Ottawa River followed by the Maumee, Ashtabula, and Black Rivers. All three types of samples-fat tissue (FT), eggs, and plasma-showed the same geographic trend in PCB levels. On a wet-weight basis, mean concentrations ranged from 2,148 to 18,669 ng/g in FT, from 183 to 3,683 ng/g in eggs, and from 18 to 201 ng/g in plasma. Across all sites, total PCB concentrations between the tissues were significantly correlated (0.001 < p < 0.005; Pearson correlation coefficient (r ( P )) was between 0.720 and 0.954). Two distinctly different profiles with respect to relative congener and homologue concentrations were found among the sites. One that included four of the six sites examined was characterized by hexa-chlorobiphenyl (hexa-CB) dominance followed by hepta-CBs, with PCBs no. 138 + 163, 153 + 132 + 105, and 180 being the most abundant congeners. The second profile, specific for turtles from the Ottawa River, was different from the first in that tetra-CBs were the most abundant congeners followed by hexa-CBs. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant intertissue differences in the PCB homologue profiles, i.e., FT had a higher percentage of hepta-, octa-, and nona-CBs compared with eggs and plasma, whereas eggs showed a higher percentage of hexa-CBs. At any listed location, FT, eggs, and plasma had the same congener profile. An intertissue distribution of lipid-normalized individual congener concentrations examined by regression analyses revealed significant egg-FT, egg-plasma, and FT-plasma relations for >40 congeners (0.001 < p < 0.05). The distribution ratios determined for these congeners from the slope of the regression lines averaged 1.235 +/- 0.279, 0.430 +/- 0.170, and 0.387 +/- 0.115, respectively. The plasma wet weight-FT lipid-normalized concentration ratios for these congeners averaged 0.012 +/- 0.006. Both egg-FT and plasma wet weight-FT lipid-normalized ratios regressed against log K(ow) showed significant decreases, with increasing log K(ow), indicating greater accumulation of highly chlorinated congeners in FT than in other compartments. The estimated 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents ranged from 0.007 ng/g at reference sites to 0.060 ng/g at contaminated sites and from 0.099 to 1.992 ng/g in plasma and eggs, respectively. In both plasma and eggs, coplanar-CBs were the major contributors to total toxic equivalents (TEQs). Eggs from all contaminated sites had TEQs that exceeded the lowest observed effect level TEQs proposed for bald eagle chicks, in addition to high SigmaPCB levels at some of these sites, especially the Ottawa and Maumee River sites, indicate potentially increased risk to turtles and possibly other wildlife species inhabiting these ecosystems. Significant correlations of total PCBs and individual congeners between FT, eggs, and plasma indicate that blood sampling can provide a good nonlethal measure of PCB exposure and can be used to monitor environmental contamination.
21111447	The aim was to determine half-life of six most abundant PCB congeners in the body of early adolescents. In 304 environmentally exposed children, PCB serum concentration was determined at the age of 8 and 12years. Half-life was determined for each child assuming exponential decrease or for the whole cohort using multiple regression. Results obtained by both approaches were in agreement. PCB reuptakes corrupting half-life estimates for each child and each congener were evaluated. If one of the serum PCB concentration values fell below the level of detection (LOD) the pair was excluded and if PCB half-life value exceeded the arbitrary value of 30years. The following median half-lives in years 4.46, 10.59, 9.7, 4.7, 9.1 and 9.8 were obtained for PCB congeners 118, 138(+163), 153, 156(+171), 170 and 180, respectively. The elimination half-life values were not systematically related to PCB serum concentration at any examination age. Between half-life values, percentage of children with significant reuptakes and PCB congener abundance in serum were found significant associations.
22841741	Because polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are thought to cause endocrine disruption, we examined 438 adolescent boys from a birth cohort in the Faroe Islands, where PCB exposures are elevated. We measured PCBs and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in cord blood and in serum from clinical examination at age 14. Higher prenatal PCB exposure was associated with lower serum concentrations of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone. In addition, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was positively associated with both prenatal and concurrent PCB exposures. The PCB-SHBG association was robust to covariate adjustment. In a structural equation model, a doubling in prenatal PCB exposure was associated with a decrease in LH of 6% (p=0.03). Prenatal exposure to PCB and DDE showed weak, non-significant inverse associations with testicular size and Tanner stage. DDE was highly correlated with PCB and showed slightly weaker associations with the hormone profile. These findings suggest that delayed puberty with low serum-LH concentrations associated with developmental exposure to non dioxin-like PCBs may be due to a central hypothalamo-pituitary mechanism.
9291496	Behavioral impairment as a consequence of PCB exposure beginning in utero has been reported in both humans and animals. The present study assessed the behavioral consequences of postnatal exposure to PCBs. Male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were dosed from birth to 20 weeks of age with 7.5 micrograms/kg/day of a PCB mixture representative of the PCBs typically found in human breast milk (8 monkeys) or vehicle (5 monkeys). At 20 weeks of age, PCB levels in fat and blood of treated monkeys were 1.7-3.6 ppm and 2-3 ppb respectively. Beginning at three years of age, monkeys were tested on a series of nonspatial discrimination reversal problems followed by a spatial delayed alternation task. Treated monkeys exhibited decreased median response latencies and variable increases in mean response latencies across the three tasks of the nonspatial discrimination reversal. There were no group differences on accuracy of performance, although some treated individuals made more mistakes at the beginning of the experiment than did control monkeys. On the delayed alteration task, the PCB-exposed group displayed retarded acquisition of the task and increased errors at short delay values, which were tested at the beginning of the experiment. There was no increase in the total number of errors in treated monkeys at long delay values. Treated monkeys engaged in more perseverative responding than controls over the entire course of the experiment, in some instances even in the absence of an increase in overall error rate. These findings are interpreted as a learning/performance decrement rather than an effect on spatial memory per se. The results of this study suggest that PCB exposure which is limited to the early postnatal period and results in environmentally-relevant body burdens produces long-term behavioral impairment.
16830529	The over-riding aim of the present investigation was to obtain information concerning exposure that can be used as a basis for studies on the health of individuals residing in the Michalovce area of eastern Slovakia which is heavily contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Accordingly, this work focused on determination of serum concentrations of hydroxylated (OH-PCBs) and methylsulfonyl-substituted (MeSO2-PCBs) metabolites of PCBs. One hundred and twenty-two men and women, 20-59 years of age, living in the contaminated area and 175 from the control Stropkov/Svidnik district were selected randomly from 2047 sampled individuals. Following a specially designed cleanup, the levels of various congeners of OH-PCBs and MeSO2-PCBs in their serum were quantitated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, with comparison to authentic reference standards. The median concentrations of PCB congeners and their OH-PCB and MeSO2-PCB metabolites were 2-3-fold higher in residents of Michalovce than in the control region. The levels of certain OH-PCB metabolites were in the same high range as those of individual PCB congeners, whereas the MeSO2-PCB levels were significantly lower. The PCB and their metabolites were present at slightly higher concentrations in men than in women, and the serum levels of PCBs and MeSO2-PCBs increased with increasing age. Thus, the environmental contamination resulting from previous industrial production of PCBs has led to elevated concentrations of PCBs and their metabolites in the serum of individuals living in the Michalovce area.
11445515	An association between in utero polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and impaired childhood intellectual functioning has been reported, but the potential impact of PCB exposure during adulthood on intellectual functioning has received little attention. We assessed the impact of PCBs and other fish-borne contaminants on intellectual functioning in older adults. The subjects were 49- to 86-year-old Michigan residents recruited from an existing cohort. Fish eaters ate > 24 lb of sport-caught Lake Michigan fish per year and non-fish eaters ate < 6 lb of Lake Michigan fish per year. A battery of cognitive tests including tests of memory and learning, executive function, and visual-spatial function was administered to 180 subjects (101 fish eaters and 79 non-fish eaters). Blood samples were analyzed for PCBs and 10 other contaminants. We evaluated cognitive outcomes using multiple regression. PCBs and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE) were markedly elevated in fish eaters. After controlling for potential confounders PCB, but not DDE, exposure was associated with lower scores on several measures of memory and learning. These included the Weschler Memory Scale verbal delayed recall (p = 0.001), the semantic cluster ratio (p = 0.006), and list A, trial 1 (p = 0.037), from the California Verbal Learning Test. In contrast, executive and visual-spatial function were not impaired by exposure to either PCBs or DDE. In conclusion, PCB exposure during adulthood was associated with impairments in memory and learning, whereas executive and visual-spatial function were unaffected. These results are consistent with previous research showing an association between in utero PCB exposure and impairments of memory during infancy and childhood.
23332876	Brescia (North Italy) is located in a highly industrialized area with diffuse environmental pollution by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and with a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the concentration of PCBs congeners in serum, liver and adipose tissue of patients with HCC living in this area. We enrolled prospectively 101 HCC incident cases. Lipid-adjusted PCBs concentration of single congeners and total PCBs concentration, computed as the sum of 24 PCBs congeners, were measured in the serum of all subjects and in the liver and abdominal fat of 59 HCC cases undergoing surgery. A high correlation was found between PCBs serum and liver (Spearman r=0.79), serum and fat (r=0.91), and liver and fat (r=0.75) concentrations. Serum PCBs concentration in HCC patients did not vary according to demographical, clinical or epidemiological variables, apart from age, as PCBs concentration increased linearly with the subject's age. This study confirms that serum lipid-adjusted PCBs concentration is a valid measure of PCBs body storage and is highly correlated with PCBs concentration detected in other biological samples.
12919720	The polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been demonstrated to be inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes and some of their effects such as hormonal imbalance, and alteration of lipid and porphyrin metabolism could be ascribed to this mechanism. For this reason, the urinary excretion of D-glucaric acid (DGA), an indirect indicator of enzymatic induction, was suggested as a biological marker of effect following exposure to PCBs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether any inductive effects resulting from exposure to these compounds through ingestion of contaminated food could be detected early by measuring urinary DGA (U-DGA). U-DGA was measured in 73 subjects exposed to PCBs due to ingestion of PCB-contaminated food and levels ranged from 1.7 to 12.4 mmol/mol creatinine, with a mean value of 5.96 mmol/mol creatinine. These values were higher than those usually found in the general population. Sex and smoking habits did not affect U-DGA excretion, while age and alcohol intake were significantly correlated with U-DGA excretion, a finding in agreement with the results of other investigations. Neither total PCB blood concentration nor PCB chlorine content was significantly correlated with U-DGA excretion, and only the PCB 138 congener was weakly correlated with U-DGA levels. The results indicate that, for exposure to PCB resulting in blood concentrations up to 394 microg/l, no statistically significant effect of these persistent organochlorine compounds on human enzyme induction could be demonstrated, as measured by DGA urinary excretion.
3936176	Blood samples from 738 employees of the Southern California Edison Company were analyzed for PCBs prior to their starting work, as part of a pre-employment medical examination. Blood PCB concentrations of the pre-employment sample had a median of 4 ppb and a mean of 5 +/- 4 ppb. These data are comparable to previously published values for blood PCB concentrations in people without occupational exposure. Plasma PCB concentrations are also sorted by demographic characteristics of the sample (age/race/sex/education). Since the demographic properties of the newly hired employees are reasonably similar to those of the Los Angeles-Long Beach work force, as determined in the 1980 census, we conclude that the low PCB concentrations present in the blood of a sample of new electric utility employees is representative of the regional work force and arise from exposures to PCBs present in the general environment.
22047017	Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) during pre-natal and early life can alter normal immune system development. Blood specimens from newborns, 6-, and 16-month-old infants were collected in the Michalovce and Svidnik/Stropkov districts, areas with, respectively, high and low environmental PCB contamination, and lymphocyte receptor expression was evaluated by multi-color flow cytometry. The results indicate that the percentage of lymphoid dendritic cells (DC) and naïve/resting T-lymphocytes were significantly increased at 6-months in Michalovce as compared to the same cell types in cord blood samples (p < 0.001), whereas natural regulatory T-lymphocytes and suppressor inducer T-lymphocytes were reduced (p < 0.001). Overall, a positive linear correlation of terminally differentiated effector memory (TEM) T-lymphocyte population with age, but a negative linear correlation for myeloid DC from birth to 6-months in both regions were found. Michalovce samples indicated significantly higher expression of memory T-lymphocytes (birth, 6(th), and 16(th) month), TEM T-lymphocytes (birth and 6(th) month), and lymphoid DC (6(th) month) compared to the Svidnik/Stropkov regions. After adjustment for relevant covariates, such as maternal age, parity, season of birth, breastfeeding, birth weight, and gender, the myeloid DC, suppressor inducer T-lymphocytes, truly naïve helper/inducer T-lymphocytes, and TEM T-lymphocytes remained significantly different between districts in cord blood samples. The multivariate analysis models for 6- and 16-month samples showed district differences in all cellular determinants, except for lymphoid DC and macrophage-like cells. This study provides the first evidence that pre-natal and early post-natal exposure to PCBs affects the dynamics of cell surface receptor expression on lymphoid DC and DC-like cells, suggesting impaired immunologic development following pre-natal and early post-natal PCB exposure.
10047599	To evaluate the possibilities of applying plasma retinol as a biomarker of response in seabirds exposed to chronic low levels of organochlorines, the relationship between yolk content of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and plasma retinol levels were studied in newly hatched shag chicks (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) from the coast of central Norway. The mean concentration of 29 PCB-congeners (SigmaPCB) in the yolk sac was 1.22 microgram/g ww (wet weight basis) (SD = 0.57, n = 10), or 17.99 ng/g lw (lipid weight basis) (SD = 6.26, n = 10). Expressed as TCDD-equivalents (SigmaTEQ), the exposure in the yolk sac was 43.9 pg/g ww (SD = 19.5, n = 10), or 637.1 pg/g lw (SD = 240.8, n = 10), considerably lower than the levels that have been associated with clear-cut lethal and sublethal effects such as egg mortality, hatchability, or live deformity in Phalacrocoracidae species. There were significant negative correlations between SigmaPCB ww and the variables egg volume, yolk mass, and hatchling mass. We suggest that these relationships are passive causes of a higher lipid concentration in small eggs, rather than the PCB affecting the variables. Analyses showed that there was a borderline significant positive correlation between SigmaPCB lw in yolk and plasma retinol concentration. Although the results indicate that plasma retinol level alone is a poor indicator of PCB exposure in shag hatchlings, the result may be related to the low level of contaminant exposure and the low sample size of the study.
21979175	The current study examines whether the occupation of firefighting contributes to exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). We compared serum dioxin concentrations and congener profiles of current firefighters (n=13) with those of men who have ceased employment as firefighters (n=17) and with men employed in occupations other than firefighter (n=10). We found that compared to former or non-firefighters, current firefighters have higher levels of dioxins primarily due to the contribution of PCBs and to a lesser extent PCDFs. PCDFs were significantly higher in former firefighters compared to non-firefighters (p<0.05). Comparisons with studies performed by other investigators suggest that local environmental conditions contribute to some of the elevation of PCBs. The congeners 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzodioxin and PCB-114 were significantly higher in current firefighters when compared to former or non-firefighters. Moreover, levels of these congeners were inversely correlated with years since employed as firefighter (Spearman r=-0.610, p=0.009 and Spearman r=-0.53, p=0.03, respectively). The classes of dioxins show an overall decline with years since employed as firefighters, this decline is most evident with PCDDs (Spearman r=-0.46, p=0.06). Together, the combination of evidence supports firefighting as a source of exposure to dioxins.
17280705	We measured levels of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho, and mono-ortho substituted PCBs in 106 US Air Force Vietnam veterans, participants of the Air Force Health Study (AFHS) who attended the final medical examination in 2002. Twelve veterans were Ranch Hands involved in aerial spraying of herbicides in Vietnam (1962-1971), and 94 were Comparisons who flew transport missions in Southeast Asia (SEA) during the same time period. These veterans had no previous 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) measurement because they had not attended any of the previous AFHS examinations, or their previous measurements were missing or not valid. The mean TCDD levels in 2002 were 1.7 pg/g lipid in Comparisons and 5.5 pg/g lipid in Ranch Hands. The mean PCDD toxic equivalent - TEQ (1997) in Comparisons was 12.6 pg/g lipid, 5.4 pg/g lipid for PCDFs, 5.2 pg/g lipid for non-ortho PCBs, and 9.4 pg/g lipid for mono-ortho PCBs, with a total mean TEQ (1997) of 32.6 pg/g lipid. Corresponding mean TEQs in Ranch Hands were 15.5 pg/g lipid for PCDDs, 4.6 pg/g lipid for PCDFs, 2.2 pg/g lipid for non-ortho PCBs, and 9.3 pg/g lipid for mono-ortho PCBs, yielding the total mean TEQ (1997) of 31.6pg/g lipid. Using the re-evaluated 2005 WHO TEFs, the total mean TEQs (2005) decreased by about 28% in both Comparisons and Ranch Hands, to 23.6 pg/g lipid and 22.8 pg/g lipid, respectively. This was mainly due to changes of TEFs for the group of mono-ortho PCBs, which decreased the mono-ortho PCBs TEQs by almost 90% in both Ranch Hands and Comparisons.
1489385	A previously characterized cohort of 115 Great Lakes fisheaters and 95 non-fisheating controls was re-examined in 1989 to evaluate changes that had occurred in serum PCB and DDT levels since the 1982 study. Substantial and significant decreases in mean serum DDT levels had occurred in both fisheaters (25.8 ppb vs 15.6 ppb) and controls (9.6 ppb vs 6.8 ppb) over this time period. In contrast, only a slight decrease in serum PCB levels was observed, and in fisheaters only. No association between individual changes in serum PCB or DDT levels and self-reported changes in Great Lakes fish consumption was observed. The findings from this longitudinal examination of serum PCB and DDT levels confirm earlier cross-sectional surveys of western populations, and demonstrate that the prohibition of DDT has been successful in reducing the level of DDT contamination in human populations.
17710387	The Certificate of Analysis for SRM 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in Human Serum has been updated to include certified concentration values for 27 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, three chlorinated pesticides, and four polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners as well as reference concentration values for 27 additional PCB congeners, six additional chlorinated pesticides, three additional PBDE congeners, and selected polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). This represents an addition of concentration values for 29 PCB congeners and for PBDE congeners that were not quantified in the previous issue of SRM 1589a. With the increased number of certified and reference concentration values for PCBs and the inclusion of certified and reference concentration values for PBDEs, this serum material will be more useful as a reference material for contaminant monitoring in human tissues and fluids.
16882544	OBJECTIVE: We set out to assess whether environmental prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with incidence of acute respiratory infections in preschool Inuit children. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the medical charts of 343 children from 0 to 5 years of age and evaluated the associations between PCB-153 concentration in umbilical cord plasma and the incidence rates of acute otitis media (AOM) and of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTIs and LRTIs, respectively). RESULTS: The incidence rates of AOM and LRTIs were positively associated with prenatal exposure to PCBs. Compared with children in the first quartile of exposure (least exposed), children in fourth quartile (most exposed) had rate ratios of 1.25 (p<0.001) and 1.40 (p<0.001) for AOM and LRTIs, respectively. There was no association between prenatal PCB exposure and incidence rate of URTIs or hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to PCBs could be responsible for a significant portion of respiratory infections in children of this population. 
9096084	Human plasma samples from 50 wives of fishermen have been analyzed with respect to PCBs. The non-ortho-substituted PCB congeners CB-126 and CB-169 were determined by mass spectrometry in negative ion chemical ionization mode, which demonstrated a limit of detection of 30 fg. The recoveries of the internal standards used for determination of ortho-substituted CBs were approximately 95%. Two methods, one gravimetric and the other based on enzymatic determinations of triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids, were compared for the determination of total amount of lipids in the plasma samples; the correlation coefficient was 0.82 and the slope 0.98. For practical reasons, enzymatic determinations are recommended for further use. The total, lipid-adjusted concentrations of PCBs in plasma were influenced by age, total lactation time and consumption of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea.
11802470	Contamination of fish in the Great Lakes generated three surveys assessing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) serum concentration in Michigan anglers: 1973 to 1974, 1979 to 1982, and 1989 to 1991. This cohort provided 1177 individuals with PCB determinations. In 2000, we conducted telephone interviews with parents on their children's birth characteristics. We estimated the sex odds ratio for parental PCB and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene concentrations using generalized estimation equations. We identified 208 offspring, within 101 families, born after 1963, with paternal measurements of both PCB and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene. When controlling for maternal exposure and parental dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene, the sex odds ratio was increased if paternal PCB concentrations exceeded 8.1 micrograms/L (sex ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 4.74). Thus, paternal exposure was linked to a higher proportion of male offspring. These findings are opposite those reported for the Seveso study and are in accordance with those for dioxin exposure in the American veterans study.
7552046	Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been identified in wildlife and human samples. Most of these compounds are highly chlorinated (penta-hepatachloro) and contain a single meta- or para-hydroxyl group. Using the Cadogan coupling procedure, the following hydroxy-PCBs congeners were synthesized: 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol, 2,3',4,4',5-pentachloro-3-biphenylol, 2',3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol, 2,2',3',4,4'-pentachloro-3-biphenylol, 2,2',3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol, 2,2',3',4,4',5-hexachloro-3-biphenylol, 2,2',3,4',5,5'-hexachloro-4-biphenylol, 2,2',3,3',4',5,5'-heptachloro-4-biphenylol, 2,2',3',4,4',5,5'-hepatachloro-3-biphenylol, 2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachloro-4-biphenylol. Many of these compounds have been detected as residues in human serum and current studies are investigating their activities as agonists and antagonists for several endocrine-mediated responses.
8197591	Sixty-seven female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were orally dosed daily for 152 weeks with 0, 5, 20, 40, and 80 micrograms Aroclor 1254 (PCB)/kg body wt. Blood polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were highly positively correlated (r = 0.92, P < 0.001) with doses of PCB administered. A comprehensive analysis of plasma lipids/lipoproteins revealed a PCB-associated increase in plasma triglycerides and decreases in plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol), very-low plus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL+LDL-chol), and total carnitine (which is involved in fatty acid metabolism). All of the lipid/lipoprotein changes were significantly (P < or = 0.05) correlated with blood PCB concentration. These data, obtained after 152 weeks of continuous daily exposure of a primate model to PCB support a causal relationship between plasma lipid changes and PCB intake. Previously, causality has been refuted on the premise that the commonly observed elevation of triglycerides with increasing concentration of blood PCB is a reflection, not of PCB dose, but of the partitioning of PCB between tissues (adipose) and blood in proportion to the blood lipid present. The mechanism of the plasma lipid changes was not investigated in this study but the altered lipid/lipoprotein pattern is discussed with respect to known cardiovascular risk profiles.
10504153	As part of an epidemiologic study on exposure to a toxic waste incineration plant we investigated whether blood concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), lead, and cadmium, as well as concentration of mercury in 24-hr urine samples were associated with thyroid hormone status. As an indication of status, we determined levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and free triiodothyronine (FT(3)) in children living in households where [less than/equal to] 10 cigarettes were smoked per day. Eight PCB congeners (PCBs 101, 118, 138, 153, 170, 180, 183, and 187) were measured in whole blood samples. Of these, seven congeners (PCB 101 was not detected in any sample) and the sum of all PCB congeners were analyzed as predictors for thyroid hormone status in separate linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. In addition, the possible effects of cadmium, lead, and mercury on levels of thyroid hormones were examined. Blood concentrations and information on questionnaire data were available for 320 children 7-10 years of age. We found a statistically significant positive association between the mono-ortho congener PCB 118 and TSH as well as statistically significant negative relationships of PCBs 138, 153, 180, 183, and 187 to FT(3). There was no association for the PCB congeners and FT(4). Blood cadmium concentration was associated with increasing TSH and diminishing FT(4). Blood lead and urine concentration of mercury were of no importance to thyroid hormone levels. The results stress the need for future studies on the possible influences of PCB and cadmium exposure on thyroid hormones, particularly in children. These studies should also take neurologic development into account.
3099428	The influence of serum lipids and proteins on partitioning of individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener peaks between human serum and adipose tissue lipid was assessed using regression analysis. Subjects were 55 repair workers who were either currently or previously exposed, and 56 comparison workers without occupational exposure to PCBs. Seven congeners (2,4,5,4'-tetra CB, 2,3,5,2',3',6'-hexa CB, 2,3,4,2',3',6'-hexa CB, 2,3,4,2',4',5'-hexa CB, 3,4,5,3',4'-penta CB, 2,3,4,5,2',3',4'-hepta CB, and 2,3,4,5,2',3',4',5'-octa CB) which had been quantified in both serum and adipose tissue in at least one-third of the total study population were selected for evaluation. Initially the crude correlations between the serum PCB and certain candidate variables were assessed; more than one congener was correlated with serum cholesterol, albumin, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins, age, body fat content, and average servings of fish per day. Stepwise regression of log serum congener concentration on log adipose congener concentration and these variables was performed. Only cholesterol, albumin, and average servings of fish per day were significant for at least one congener peak. Congeners behaved in two groups, depending on their order of chromatographic elution. For 2,4,5,4'-tetra CB, 2,3,5,2',3',6'-hexa CB, and 2,3,4,2',3',6'-hexa CB, log serum concentration was not significantly correlated with log adipose congener concentration, and there was no consistent pattern for significant candidate variables. For congeners 2,3,4,2',4',5'-hexa CB, 3,4,5,3',4'-penta CB, 2,3,4,5,2',3',4'-hepta CB, and 2,3,4,5,2',3',4',5'-octa CB, log serum congener concentration was consistently significantly correlated with log adipose congener concentration and serum cholesterol positively, and with serum albumin negatively. For these four congeners the explanations of variation (R2) in serum congener concentration using adipose congener concentration alone were 3, 23, 20, and 30%, respectively, and after adding cholesterol and albumin were 13, 56, 43, and 46%. Thus we conclude that serum cholesterol and albumin can influence the distribution or partition of PCBs between serum and adipose tissue.
21890171	There is a dearth of information on the temporal changes in polychlorinated dibenzodioxin/furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) contamination, in both environmental and biological specimens, in China. We compared the concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in human milk collected in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, in northern China in 2002 (n=30) and 2007 (n=20). The level of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs showed an increasing trend. The mean concentrations of PCDD/Fs plus dl-PCBs were 4.47 TEQ pg g(-1) fat and 6.24 TEQ pg g(-1) fat in human milk from Shijiazhuang in 2002 and in 2007, respectively. Based on statistical analysis of questionnaire data collected by in-person interviews with mothers, we found positive correlations between consumption of sea fish and PCDFs. The PCDDs, PCDFs, PCDD/Fs, and PCDD/Fs plus dl-PCBs levels in individuals consuming greater amounts of sea fish were higher than those consuming less sea fish, both with and without adjustments for potential confounding factors. Among 17 congeners of PCDD/Fs, the 2,3,7,8-TCDF, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF, and 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF congener concentrations in 2007 increased 134%, 55%, 53%, 57%, 65% and 130% when compared to 2002 levels, respectively. The 2007 dl-PCB congener levels were greater than those of the 2002 samples, with the exception of PCB81 and PCB77. Specifically, PCB105, PCB114, PCB118, PCB123 and PCB156 had increased greater than twofold from 2002 to 2007. Continuous surveillance of PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels in human milk is needed to accurately evaluate both environmental contamination and the human health risk to neonates in China.
11134554	Humans and animals are exposed daily to a complex mixture of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs). Previous work has shown that exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of endometriosis in the rhesus monkey. Dioxin-like chemicals can also exert effects in combination with TCDD via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This study demonstrates that the serum levels of TCDD and specific dioxin-like PHAH congeners were increased in TCDD-treated animals with endometriosis 13 years after the TCDD exposure. Nine TCDD-exposed and 6 unexposed female rhesus monkeys were evaluated for serum content of relevant compounds and for endometriosis by surgical laparoscopy. Additional studies were done on 4 animals that died 7 to 11 years after exposure to TCDD and 4 lead-treated animals with no history of PHAH treatment. For TCDD-exposed and unexposed animals, TCDD exposure correlated with an increased serum TCDD concentration. Furthermore, TCDD exposure and an elevated serum TCDD concentration were associated with increased serum levels of triglycerides, 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) and 3,3'4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PnCB). Importantly, the animals with elevated serum levels of 3,3',4,4'-TCB, 3,3',4,4',5-PnCB and an increased total serum TEQ had a high prevalence of endometriosis, and the severity of disease correlated with the serum concentration of 3,3,',4,4'-TCB. Increased serum concentrations of coplanar PCBs were also present in lead-treated animals. Implications of these findings for human health and the prevalence of endometriosis in humans will be discussed.
6778977	Exposure of rat to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) results in an increase in activity of liver microsomal mixed function oxidase system, plasma cholesterol and urinary ascorbic acid. Experiments were designed to study the effect of dietary quality of protein on these metabolic responses to dietary addition of PCB. The diets contained either whole egg protein, casein, fish protein, soy protein, soy protein plus 0.34% methionine, wheat-gluten, corn-gluten or gelatin fed at 10% of the diet. In general, the relative biological values of proteins as shown by the gains in body weight were positively correlated with activity of the microsomal enzyme system including aminopyrine N-demethylase, aniline hydroxylase, cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, plasma level of cholesterol and urinary ascorbic acid. Supplement of methionine to soy protein diet containing PCB caused a significant increase in liver and plasma cholesterol and in urinary ascorbic acid, although the influence on the microsomal enzyme system was slight. The gelatin diet containing PCB gave higher activity of the enzyme system than that expected from the biological value, although the same protein diet without PCB caused quite low activity as expected from the biological value.
3921370	A follow-up study of capacitor manufacturing workers exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their children was conducted since 1973. PCB levels in whole blood of workers as well as in breast milk of the exposed lactating mothers were approximately 10 to 100 times those of nonexposed Japanese. Blood PCB levels had a statistically significant correlation with the duration of PCB handling and breast milk PCB levels. The rate of decline of blood PCB levels, as well as the changes of the gas chromatograph of blood PCB over 7 years was found to vary with the kind of PCB handled. The levels of blood PCB tended to be higher in the children fed PCB-contaminated breast milk for a long period. The great majority of workers handling PCBs had dermatologic complaints. Discontinuance of contact with PCB led to gradual improvement of these lesions. Abnormal results in the blood chemistry of the workers were rare, while serum triglyceride concentration was significantly correlated with blood PCB levels in 1974. In the questionnaire study, the number of complaints in children born from mothers who had handled PCBs, especially those fed breast milk for a long period, was conspicuously higher than that in control groups. Several children were found to have the same medical findings as in yusho; however, they have not been diagnosed as PCB-poisoning, because these findings were neither so serious nor related to the blood PCB levels.
11914190	Some reports indicate that exposure to specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners is related to breast cancer risk. The authors recruited participants in a case-control study from October 1994 to March 1997 to assess the relation between breast cancer risk and concentrations of 14 PCB congeners measured in plasma lipids by high-resolution gas chromatography. Participants were incident cases of breast cancer (n = 314) and controls (n = 523) from the Quebec City region (Canada). Compared with controls, cases had significantly higher concentrations of PCB 99 (p = 0.02), PCB 118 (p = 0.03), and PCB 156 (p = 0.006). Associations were found between breast cancer risk and either PCB 118 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 2.53; fourth vs. first quartile) or PCB 156 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.94; fourth vs. first quartile) concentration. Breast cancer risk was also associated with a total concentration of the three mono-ortho-substituted congeners 105, 118, and 156 expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents (OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.28; fourth vs. first quartile). These results suggest that exposure to dioxin-like PCBs increases breast cancer risk. Alternatively, the results may be explained by differences between cases and controls regarding metabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of both mono-ortho PCBs and estrogens.
20609460	Male common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from eastern Lake Erie, which is greatly effected by urbanization, agriculture, and industry, were analyzed for PCB and PBDE concentrations in plasma, muscle, and liver to evaluate exposure to these chemicals through habitat interactions. Additional male carp from two nearby relatively clean lakes (Bear Lake and Hemlock Lake, NY) were also sampled as controls. While PCBs were detected in muscle, liver, and plasma of Lake Erie carp, the largest concentrations were found in muscle, which also had the most number of congeners. The dominant congeners were PCB 138 and PCB 153. Concentrations of PCB 153 in the muscle were correlated with fish length, total weight, and age. Therefore, larger (and generally older) carp had the highest concentrations of PCB 153. In contrast, PBDEs were found only in muscle with the predominant congener being PBDE 47. The total PCB concentrations in muscle of male carp from eastern Lake Erie (ranging from nd to 15,000 ng g(-1) lipid) were 100-fold higher than the total PBDE observed (1.5-100 ng g(-1) lipid), indicating a higher level of contamination of PCBs in Lake Erie. The high PCB levels in carp points to PCB resistance to metabolic degradation.
21565388	The presence of mast cells has been reported in all classes of vertebrates, including many teleost fish families. The mast cells of teleosts, both morphologically and functionally, show a close similarity to the mast cells of mammals. Mast cells of teleosts, localized in the vicinity of blood vessels of the intestine, gills and skin, may play an important role in the mechanisms of inflammatory response, because they express a number of functional proteins, including piscidins, which are antimicrobical peptides that act against a broad-spectrum of pathogens. An increase in the number of mast cells in various tissues and organs of teleosts seems to be linked to a wide range of stressful conditions, such as exposure to heavy metals (cadmium, copper, lead and mercury), exposure to herbicides and parasitic infections. This study analyzed the morphological localization and abundance of mast cells in the intestine and gills of sea bream, Sparus aurata, after a 12, 24 or 72 h exposure to PCB 126, a polychlorinated biphenyl, which is a potent immunotoxic agent. In the organs of fish exposed to PCB 126, it was observed that in addition to congestion of blood vessels, there was extravasation of red blood cells, infiltration of lymphocytes, and a progressive increase in numbers of mast cells. These data confirm the immunotoxic action of PCB, and the involvement of mast cells in the inflammatory response.
3921365	Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) poisonings occurred in western Japan, where it is called yusho, in 1968, and in central Taiwan, where it is called yu-cheng, in 1979. The average concentrations of PCBs in the adipose tissue, liver and blood of yusho patients and in the blood of yu-cheng patients were 1.9 ppm, 0.08 ppm, 6.7 ppb and 99 ppb, respectively. Seven PCB congeners, such as 2,4,5,3',4'-pentachloro-, 2,3,4,3',4'-pentachloro-, 2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachloro-, 2,3,4,2',4',5'-hexachloro-, 2,3,4,5,3',4'-hexachloro-, 2,3,4,5,2',4',5'-heptachloro- and 2,3,4,5,2',3',4'-heptachloro biphenyls were identified in the blood and tissues of patients with yusho and yu-cheng and controls. The concentration of 2,3,4,5,3',4'-hexachlorobiphenyl was comparatively higher in the patients than in controls. The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the adipose tissue and liver of yusho patients were 6 to 13 ppb and 3 to 25 ppb, respectively, while no PCDFs were detected in the controls. Major PCDF congeners identified in the tissues and blood of yusho and yu-cheng patients were the 2,3,6,8-tetrachloro-, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-, 1,2,4,7,8-pentachloro-, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachloro- and 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofurans (DFs), of which the 2,3,4,7,8-pentachloro compound was predominant. The concentrations of methylthio-PCB in the liver, lung and adipose tissue of yusho patients were 0.1 to 0.5, 0.2 to 1.4 and 0.5 to 1.0 ppb, respectively, and those of methysulfone PCBs were 0.3 to 0.7, 1.0 to 2.5 and 0.7 to 1.0 ppb, respectively. Some of the major peaks of the PCB methylthio and methylsulfone derivatives were identical in gas chromatographic retention times with those of 4-methylthio- and 4-methylsulfone-2,5,2',5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl PCDFs, especially 2,3,4,7,8-pentachloro DF, appear to be mainly responsible in the poisonings.
6402484	Twenty-five laboratories participated in a study to determine the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in 3 bovine serum pools, referred to as trial environmental pools (TEPs). TEPs 2 and 3 contained, respectively, low (9.97 ppb) and high (49.64 ppb) levels of PCBs (as in vivo-bound Aroclor 1254) and the same level of 9 commonly occurring chlorinated hydrocarbons. TEP 1 contained only naturally occurring levels of these analytes. Laboratories analyzed each sample in duplicate by the method used in their laboratory for measuring PCBs in blood serum. The coefficients of variation (CV) for the 12 laboratories reporting quantitative data and the required number of analyses for TEP 2 and TEP 3 were 37.0 and 30.7%, respectively. The mean recoveries for these 12 laboratories were 239.3 and 165.4% for TEP 2 and TEP 3, respectively. Three laboratories reported data with mean values for TEP 2 and TEP 3 within +/- 3 standard deviations of the CDC characterized mean. Their coefficients of variation were 12.4 and 18.8% for TEP 2 and TEP 3, respectively. The mean recoveries for these 3 laboratories were 150.7 and 98.4% for TEP 2 and TEP 3, respectively. Our most significant observations were the laboratories' failure to separate PCBs from DDTs and the excessive background of the reagent blanks. The widely discrepant results indicate a definite need to standardize methodology for this analysis.
21362590	BACKGROUND: Residents of Anniston, Alabama, live near a Monsanto plant that manufactured polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from 1929 to 1971 and are relatively heavily exposed. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the relationship, if any, between blood pressure and levels of total serum PCBs, several PCB groups with common actions or structure, 35 individual PCB congeners, and nine chlorinated pesticides. METHODS: Linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between blood pressure and serum levels of the various contaminants after adjustment for age, body mass index, sex, race, smoking, and exercise in 394 Anniston residents who were not taking antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Other than age, total serum PCB concentration was the strongest determinant of blood pressure of the covariates studied. We found the strongest associations for those PCB congeners that had multiple ortho chlorines. We found the associations over the full range of blood pressure as well as in those subjects whose blood pressure was in the normal range. The chlorinated pesticides showed no consistent relationship to blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, serum concentrations of PCBs, especially those congeners with multiple ortho chlorines, were strongly associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
2127352	The distribution of 14C-toxaphene, 14C-DDT, and 14C-PCB among lipoprotein fractions was studied in vitro and in vivo using rat and human plasma. The association of these substances with rat plasma fractions was similar in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Thirty-seven to fifty-two per cent of the total radioactivity was associated with the cholesterol-rich high density lipoproteins (HDL2, d = 1.075-1.21 g/ml) and 18-52% was recovered in the albumin-rich bottom fraction (BF, d greater than 1.21 g/ml). A time-dependent redistribution of the radioactivity from the lipoprotein fractions to the BF was also observed in the in vivo studies. In human plasma, the distribution of the three compounds was different and uncorrelated to the cholesterol level of the individual lipoprotein fractions. Toxaphene was almost equally distributed between BF (d greater than 1.21 ml), HDL (d = 1.063-1.21 g/ml) and low density lipoproteins (LDL, d = 1.006-1.063 g/ml) (26%, 27% and 29%, respectively), while only 18% appeared in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL, d less than 1.006) fraction. In contrast, a large proportion of DDT and PCB radioactivity was recovered in the BF (52% and 62%, respectively) while only 38-48% was present in lipoprotein fractions. The complex nature of the interaction between xenobiotics and plasma lipoproteins is discussed.
22906770	Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with numerous adverse health effects. Although the main route of exposure to PCBs is through the gastrointestinal tract, little is known about the contribution of the gut to the health effects of PCBs. We hypothesize that PCBs can disrupt intestinal integrity, causing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation into the bloodstream and potentiation of the systemic toxicity of PCBs. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to individual PCB congeners by oral gavage, followed by the assessment of small intestine morphology and plasma levels of proinflammatory mediators. In addition, mice and human brain endothelial cells were exposed to PCB118 in the presence or absence of LPS to evaluate the contribution of LPS to PCB-induced toxicity at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) level. Oral administration of PCB153, PCB118, or PCB126 disrupted intestinal morphology and increased plasma levels of LPS and proinflammatory cytokines. Direct injection of LPS and PCB118 into the cerebral microvasculature resulted in synergistic disruption of BBB integrity and decreased expression of tight junction proteins in brain microvessels. In vitro experiments confirmed these effects and indicated that stimulation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway can be responsible for these effects via activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). These results indicate that LPS may be a contributing factor in PCB-induced dysfunction of the brain endothelium via stimulation of the TLR4/IRF-3 pathway.
11478695	The levels of beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and thyroglobulin (TG) were measured in the serum of 245 employees of chemical factory formerly producing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) consisting of 54 males (age range 24-65 years, median 45) and 191 females (age range 20-69 years, median 45). The control population consisted of 636 adults from control areas of northwest and east Slovakia. The frequency of beta2-microglobulin levels lower than 1.6 microg/ml in 242 employees of chemical factory was 76.8% (186/242) which was three times higher (P<0.001) than 24.4% (155/635) in 636 controls. Still more remarkable difference was obtained when using the cut/off level of 1.2 microg/ml, the frequency of such values in the employees being 45.4% (110/242) vs. 4.4% (28/635) in the controls. In contrast, no difference in alpha-fetoprotein levels was observed between the employees and the controls, the respective frequency of these < 5.0 ng/ml being 87.6% (212/242) vs. 86.2% (389/451) and these < 10.0 ng/ml being 100.0% (242/242) vs. 97.8% (441/451). Similarly, the frequency of normal thyroglobulin levels < 50.0 ng/ml) did not differ, being 95.6% (174/182) in the employees and 87.9% (87/99) in the controls. Most of a total of 20 cases with thyroglobulin level > 50.0 ng/ml showed sonographicaly enlarged and multinodular thyroid with focal or diffuse hypoechogenicity, three of them showed solitary nodule with a diameter > 10 mm. Although the decreased levels of beta2-microglobulin might be somehow related to the modulation of immune system, more plausible explanation appears to be the possible impairment of renal tubules by PCB similar to that caused by heavy metals resulting in increased urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulin and decrease of its blood level.
10908103	In studies of the potential health effects of background-level exposure to organochlorine compounds (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans), investigators have often measured either polychlorinated biphenyls or polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofuransbut not both. We measured polychlorinated biphenyls (including specific non-, mono-, and di-ortho congeners) and specific polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans among 63 Canadian blood donors. Levels of these compounds were, in general, fairly correlated. For example, Pearson's correlation coefficient between log total polychlorinated biphenyl and log total polychlorinated dibenzodioxins was .52. These results suggest that in epidemiologic studies of health effects of background-level exposures to these compounds, the quantitative dose-response relation observed for a given compound (or class of compounds acting through a similar mechanism) may easily be miscalibrated or confounded.
22464436	Present study investigated the applicability of ordered TiO(2) nanotube arrays for the enrichment and determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in water samples. A new and reliable method was developed for the preconcentration and determination of PCBs by micro-solid phase equilibrium extraction in combination with gas chromatography and electron capture detection (GC-ECD), which exploited the special physical and chemical properties of ordered TiO(2) nanotube arrays. The experimental results indicated that low LODs were easily achieved in the range of 0.02-0.10 μg L(-1) for PCB-28, PCB-52, PCB-101, PCB-153, PCB-138, and PCB-180. The proposed method was validated with several real water samples, and good spiked recoveries have been obtained in the range of 95.8-110.5%. The experimental results demonstrated that TiO(2) nanotube arrays could be reused for over 200 times without the lost of the extraction efficiency. All these showed that TiO(2) nanotube arrays would be very useful in the enrichment and determination of trace pollutants.
10637135	The catechol metabolites of estradiol, 2- and 4-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE(2) and 4-OHE(2), respectively) are potent signaling molecules and are hypothesized to be central to estrogen-linked carcinogenesis. Methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is the principal means of catechol estrogen (CE) deactivation in the liver and other tissues. The present studies were conducted to determine the effects of PCBs and catechol metabolites of PCBs on the COMT-mediated catabolism of 4-OHE(2) and 2-OHE(2) in vitro and in vivo. Liver homogenates of female Sprague-Dawley rats treated with Aroclor 1254 for 21 days (5 mg/kg/day) showed a 30 and 40% reduction of COMT activity toward 2-OHE(2) and 4-OHE(2), respectively. Incubation of [(3)H]-beta-estradiol with these same liver homogenates, followed by HPLC analysis, demonstrated an elevation of CEs and a nearly complete reduction in levels of methylated catechol estrogens. In classical enzyme kinetics studies, COMT was demonstrated to have a high affinity for catechol PCBs, with K(m)'s approximately equivalent to those of CEs. Catechol PCBs were also potent inhibitors of CE O-methylation. These data suggest that PCBs may significantly alter the metabolism of catechol estrogens in vivo and that this effect may be mediated by catechol metabolites of PCBs. It is further speculated that methyltransferase inhibition by PCB catechols may contribute to PCB-mediated endocrine effects and liver carcinogenesis.
20971493	We measured the concentration of each polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener in whole blood, plasma and blood cells, and investigated the distribution of PCBs in human blood using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The PCB concentrations in plasma and whole blood in terms of lipid concentrations were almost equal, with a correlation coefficient of r=0.972. In the blood, the ratio of PCBs in blood cells to those in plasma was generally about 1:9 and the congener distribution patterns in blood cells and plasma were similar. We performed verification of a simple mass screening method by obtaining information on the main PCB congeners for investigations on human accumulation and exposure. The total concentration of the seven PCB congeners (UNEP-7) proposed to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by Muir and Morita was about 50% of the total concentration of all PCB congeners, and UNEP-30 was about 80%. The seven main congeners in the blood (MCB-7) showed a value that was about 60%, and MCB-30 showed a value that was about 90%. Determinations with the main congeners in the blood showed a correlation of r=0.990 or more between the main eight congeners (MCB-7 plus #74) and the total PCB concentration for all congeners. The results suggest that, although total PCB concentration can be effectively estimated from the main seven congeners, the main eight congeners would be preferable, and that the use of these congeners in the simple mass screening method would be effective for populations in areas uncontaminated by PCBs.
10481248	A method was developed to determine trace concentrations of a range of individual PCB congeners in biological samples (serum, food and faeces) using GC-MS, to prepare a mass balance of PCBs in humans. A simple method for the analysis of PCBs in human serum, which excluded an extraction step, was first employed. Results indicated that the recoveries of 13C12 PCB spikes were variable. A soxhlet extraction step was added and was found to be efficient and reproducible. A quality control routine and method validation results are presented. In batch tests of the methods presented it was found that the serum analysis method gave within batch mean 13C12 spike recoveries of 98-120% and standard deviations between 6 and 20%. The food/faeces analysis method gave within-batch mean 13C12 spike recoveries of 88-100%, and within batch standard deviations between 4 and 12%. The batch to batch mean recovery for serum analysis was 100%, with an RSD of 9% for high spikes and 10% for low spikes. For food/faeces analysis the batch to batch average recovery was 110%, with an RSD of 5% for high spikes and 9% for low spikes.
22578811	Polychlorinated biphenyls are persistent organic pollutants that have been used for decades in several industrial applications. Although production of polychlorinated biphenyls was restricted from the 1970s in most countries, substantial amounts remain in old equipment and buildings and they have been detected in various environmental and biological matrices. The main objective of this study was to analyze predictors of the combined exposure to three non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (congeners 138, 153 and 180) in serum and adipose tissue from an adult cohort (n=112) living in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia) and surrounding towns/villages. A second aim was to identify modifiers that might influence the statistical associations found, using crude, partially-adjusted, and global multiple linear regression models. Main predictors of serum concentrations were occupation and fatty food consumption, while those for adipose tissue concentrations included age, smoking habit, fatty food consumption, and residence. The differences between the two matrices might be derived from their biological meaning, given that adipose tissue concentrations are an indicator of chronic exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls while serum levels are a good predictor of ongoing exposure and the mobilization of polychlorinated biphenyls stored in fatty tissues. Body mass index was found to be an important modifier of these associations.
15042164	A method for the high-throughput analysis of human serum for the 38 most prevalent polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) based on the use of fast gas chromatography-isotopic dilution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-IDTOFMS) is presented. The chromatographic separation time was 8 min. The separation of the congeners was carried out either chromatographically or analytically using the mass spectral deconvolution capability of the TOFMS. The instrument and the method limits of detection (LODs) were 0.5 pg microL(-1) and 20 pg microL(-1), respectively, which is not as good as the one achieved using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) but allows the detection and quantification of the prevalent PCBs present in real human serum samples. The dynamic range covered 3 orders of magnitude. The comparison with the high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) reference method (28 min) was good and some separation improvements have been observed. This method allows the analysis of 100 samples per day per instrument.
15277017	1. Hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) are, depending on their structure, strongly retained in mammalian, fish and bird blood. This is due to strong, though reversible, binding to the thyroxine binding and transporting protein transthyretin. 2,3,3',4',5-Pentachloro-4-biphenylol (4-OH-CB 107) and 2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachloro-4-biphenylol (4-OH-CB 187) are two of five major OH-PCB congeners in human plasma. 2. The relative amounts of OH-PCB congeners vary between species and also between human populations, in spite of similar PCB congener patterns, and may depend on different pharmacokinetic parameters of the OH-PCBs. In the present study, the pharmacokinetic parameters of 4-OH-CB 107 and 4-OH-CB 187 were determined in the rat after a single intravenous dose of 1 micromol kg(-1). Plasma samples were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 3. 4-OH-CB 107 had a half-life of 3.8 days; 4-OH-CB 187 had a half-life of 15 days. Volumes of distribution were 0.07 and 0.11 l kg(-1), respectively; clearances (ml h(-1)) were 0.67 and 0.22, respectively; and the areas under the curve were estimated as approximately 1500 and 4450 nmol h ml(-1). 4. The pharmacokinetic parameters thus determined help to explain the observed differences in the relative amounts of OH-PCBs in humans and other mammals exposed to environmental PCBs.
11459154	Fish-eating birds are particularly subject to accumulation of persistent organic pollutants, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to constitute a major hazard for this group of birds. Grey heron (Ardea cinerea) hatchlings from two rookeries were applied as sentinel species to study PCB burdens in coastal ecosystems in mid Norway and north Norway, and plasma retinol and dioxin-equivalencies (sigmaTEQ) were applied to assess toxic effects of the PCB-burdens. The results show that grey herons appear to be amongst the fish-eating birds in Norway that are accumulating PCBs to the largest extent. There were no differences in sigmaPCB or sigmaTEQ in the yolk of grey heron hatchlings from the two rookeries and, accordingly, none in plasma retinol concentrations either. Furthermore, plasma retinol concentrations could not be related to sigmaPCB or sigmaTEQ. Thus, it seems that exposure levels are below the threshold for gross retinoid-related effects in grey heron hatchlings. There are also indications that the grey heron could be relatively insensitive to retinoid-related effects of PCBs. In the hatchlings with the highest pollutant levels, sigmaTEQs were in the lower range of levels that have been associated with reduced hatching success in other fish-eating bird species.
23500779	Fish represents source of nutrients and major dietary vehicle of lipophilic persistent contaminants. The study compared the effects of two legacy and two emerging fish pollutants (Hexabromocyclododecane HBCD; 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether BDE-47; 2,2',4,4',5,5'-Hexachlorobiphenyl PCB-153; 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-doxin TCDD) in juvenile female mice exposed through a salmon based rodent diet for 28 days (dietary doses: HBCD 199 mg/kg bw/day; BDE-47 450 μg/kg bw/day; PCB-153 195 μg/kg bw/day; TCDD 90 ng/kg bw/day). Dose levels were comparable to previously reported developmental Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels. None of the treatments elicited signs of overt toxicity, but HBCD increased relative liver weight. All compounds caused changes in liver, thymus and thyroid; spleen was affected by BDE-47 and PCB-153; no effects were seen in uterus and adrenals. Strongest effects in thyroid follicles were elicited by PCB-153, in thymus and liver by BDE-47. HBCD and BDE-47 induced liver fatty changes, but appeared to be less potent in the other tissues. HBCD, BDE-47 and TCDD increased serum testosterone levels and the testosterone/estradiol ratio, suggesting a potential involvement of pathways related to sex steroid biosynthesis and/or metabolism. The results support the role of toxicological studies on juvenile rodents in the hazard characterization of chemicals, due to endocrine and/or immune effects.
16356791	A solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was developed using 8M urea to desorb and extract organochlorine pesticides (OCs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from avian serum for analysis by capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The analytes were efficiently extracted from the denatured serum-lipoprotein-analyte complex by one passage through an Oasis((R)) hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB) SPE cartridge. No further clean-up was necessary, the entire extraction procedure and GC-ECD analysis can be accomplished in less than 3h. Serum volumes ranged from 100 microL to 1 mL with absolute recoveries of 90-101% for PCBs and 74% to 101% for the OC pesticides.
2551196	Serum samples from 285 4-year-old Michigan children were evaluated for levels of 11 environmental contaminants. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in half the samples tested; polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in 13-21 percent; dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), in more than 70 percent. Nursing (Mothers' milk) was the principal source of these exposures. Congener-specific analysis documented the presence of at least one highly toxic PCB congener, 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl. The data demonstrate the multigenerational impact of female exposure to persistent organic environmental contaminants.
15091378	The effect of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Clophen A50 on hepatic cytochrome P4501A1 dependent EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) activity, plasma thyroid hormone levels and plasma, kidney and liver retinoid concentrations of the euryhaline flatfish flounder (Platichthys flesus) was determined 2 and 10 days after i.p. (intraperitoneal) injection with 20, 100 and 500 mg Clophen A50/kg body weight. No effect of Clophen A50 on total cytochrome P450 content in flounder liver was observed at both time points. A six-fold, dose-dependent, significant increase in EROD activity was found at exposure day 10 in flounder receiving 100 or 500 mg Clophen A50/kg body weight. Plasma retinol concentrations were not altered at both time points after Clophen A50 administration, whereas renal retinol levels showed a minor dose-related increase at day 2 and day 10 of exposure. Significant alterations in hepatic retinoid concentrations were observed, which were not dependent on the dose of PCB administered. In addition Clophen A50 administration did not result in a dose-related alteration of total T4 concentrations in plasma. Total T3 concentrations in plasma were only significantly increased at day 2 after exposure, whereas free T4 concentrations were increased at both time points after Clophen A50 administration. These data indicate that with regard to the parameters investigated and in contrast to other fish species studied, the flounder is not a sensitive species to PCB exposure.
2165198	Four compounds--2,2', 3,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, decachlorodiphenylether, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-ethylphenyl)ethane, and dichlorobenzophenone--are recommended for monitoring the within-sample behavior of an analytical method that quantifies chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (such as Aroclor 1260) in serum using packed column gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Percent recoveries of these surrogates averaged greater than 80%, except with dichlorobenzophenone, which had an average recovery of greater than 70%.
15961582	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. In utero exposure to background levels of PCBs has been associated with intellectual impairment among children in most, but not all, studies. The authors evaluated prenatal PCB exposure in relation to cognitive test (intelligence quotient (IQ)) scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at age 7 years. Pregnant women were recruited from 12 US study centers from 1959 to 1965, and their children were followed until age 7 years (the Collaborative Perinatal Project). Third trimester serum was analyzed for PCBs in 1997-1999 for 732 women selected at random and for an additional 162 women whose children had either a low or a high IQ score. The PCB-IQ association was examined in multivariate models. Among those in the lowest exposure category (<1.25 microg of PCB/liter of serum), the fully adjusted mean IQ score was 93.6 (standard error: 1.8); among those in the highest category (> or =5 microg of PCB/liter), the mean IQ was 97.6 (standard error: 1.2); and overall the increase in IQ per unit increase in PCB level (microg/liter) was 0.22 (95% confidence interval: -0.28, 0.71). In these data, in utero exposure to background levels of PCBs was not associated with lower IQ at age 7 years.
8619235	The effect of daily oral maternal exposure to 0, 5, or 25 mg/kg body wt of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture (Aroclor 1254) on Days 10 to 16 of gestation on plasma and brain thyroid hormone concentrations and peripheral thyroid hormone concentrations and peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism were examined in fetal and weanling rats. Plasma thyroid hormone levels and hepatic microsomal thyroid hormone glucuronidation were also examined in pregnant rats and the adult offspring. Plasma and brain levels of PCBs and hydroxylated PCB metabolites were analyzed in fetal, weanling, and adult offspring. Maternal exposure to Aroclor 1254 significantly decreased fetal (Gestation Day 20) and neonatal (Postnatal Day 4) plasma total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels in a dose-dependent manner. Effects of maternal Aroclor 1254 exposure on plasma total and free T4 concentrations were less pronounced in offspring at 21 days of age and absent 90 days after birth. Plasma concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone were unaltered in fetuses, neonates, weanling rats, and adult offspring following maternal treatment with Aroclor 1254. the concentration of T4 was severely depressed in the forebrain and cerebellum of fetal rats on Day 20 of gestation following maternal Aroclor 1254 exposure. Brain triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in the Aroclor-exposed fetuses were significantly decreased relative to control values only in the low-dose group. On Day 21 postpartum T4 concentrations were significantly decreased in the forebrains of female weanling rats from the 25 mg Aroclor 1254/kg dose group, and no reductions were observed in forebrain T3 concentrations in male or female neonates. The deiodination of T4 to T3 was significantly increased in fetal forebrain homogenates by both PCB treatments. In female weanling brain homogenates the deiodination of T4 to T3 was significantly decreased in the low-dose group and unaltered in the high-dose group. No alterations in brain thyroid hormone metabolism were observed in forebrain homogenates from adult offspring exposed pre- and postnatally to Aroclor 1254. Hepatic microsomal T4 glucuronidation was significantly decreased in fetal microsomes following perinatal PCB exposure and significantly increased in weanling hepatic microsomes in a dose-dependent manner. An accumulation of mainly one PCB metabolite, 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol was observed in fetal plasma and forebrain on Gestation Day 20 and in neonatal and weanling rat plasma on Postnatal Days 4, 21, and 90. The plasma level of 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol was higher than that of the persistent PCB congener 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl in the control and PCB-exposed offspring up to Postnatal Day 21, and even after 90 days, the 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol was present in amounts approximately equal to those of CB 153. Although PCB levels were relatively high in the weanling rat forebrain, no hydroxylated PCB metabolites were detected. On Day 90 postpartum, plasma levels of PCBs and 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol were still elevated in the offspring of PCB-treated dams relative to controls. These results suggest that the accumulation of hydroxylated PCB metabolites in fetal plasma can reduce fetal plasma T4 levels and accordingly fetal brain T4 levels. However, in late gestational fetuses, the induction of brain type II thyroxine 5'-deiodinase activity compensates for decreases in brain T4 levels, so that brain T3 levels are maintained.
15254343	We have previously demonstrated that in mice, the decrease in serum thyroxine (T(4)) level by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) occurs without an increase in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (T(4)-UDP-GT) for T(4) glucuronidation, although the PCB-induced decrease in rats is generally thought to occur through induction of T(4)-UDP-GT, UGT1A1, and UGT1A6. In the present study, to further clarify the relationship between the decrease in serum T(4) level and the increase in UGT1A activity by PCB in rats, we examined the relationship using Wistar rats and Gunn rats, a mutant strain of Wistar rats deficient in UGT1A isoforms. The serum total T(4) level was markedly decreased not only in the Wistar rats but also in the Gunn rats 4 days after treatment with a PCB, Kanechlor-500 (KC500, 100 mg/kg) or 2,2',4,5,5'-pentachlorobiphenyl (PentaCB, 112 mg/kg), and there was no significant difference in magnitude of the decrease between the two rat strains. At the same time, the level and activity of T(4)-UDP-GT were significantly increased by treatment with either KC500 or PentaCB in Wistar rats but not in Gunn rats. In addition, no significant change in the level of serum total triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroid-stimulating hormone by the KC500 treatment was observed in either Wistar or Gunn rats. Furthermore, significant decrease in the activity of hepatic type-I deiodinase, which mediates the deiodization of T(4) and T(3), by treatment with KC500 or PentaCB was observed in both Wistar and Gunn rats. From the serum of KC500- or PentaCB-treated Wistar and Gunn rats, mono- and di-hydroxylated PCB metabolites, which would bind to T(4) binding serum protein (transthyretin), were detected. In conclusion, the present results suggest that the decrease in serum total T(4) level by either KC500 or PentaCB in Gunn rats was not dependent on the increase in hepatic T(4)-UDP-GT activity. The findings further suggest that the PCB-mediated decrease in serum T(4) level might occur, at least in part, through formation of the hydroxylated PCB metabolites. Furthermore, even in Wistar rats, the PCB-mediated decrease in serum T(4) level might occur not only through the increase in hepatic T(4)-UDP-GT but also via formation of hydroxylated PCB metabolites.
12055053	Some polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners are CYP1A1 inducers, and induction of this enzyme in the placenta has been linked to adverse effects on fetal development. The objective of this study was to determine if the body burden of PCBs is related to placental CYP1A1 activity in Inuit women from Nunavik (northern Québec), a population highly exposed to organochlorines. Placenta and cord blood samples were obtained from 35 Inuit women and 30 women from a southern Québec community exposed to background levels of organochlorines. We measured PCB concentrations in all cord plasma samples and in a subset of placenta samples from the Nunavik group and assessed CYP1A1 activity (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase; EROD) in placental microsomes from all participants. Concentrations of PCBs in cord plasma were strongly correlated to those in placenta (Pearson's r) = 0.77-0.97, p < 0.001) and were on average 4-fold higher in Inuit women than in southern Québec women [for PCB 153, the geometric means (geometric SDs) were 83.3 (1.9) ng/g lipid vs. 16.9 (1.6) ng/g lipid, respectively]. Despite this difference in PCB body burden, both study groups had similar EROD activities when data were stratified according to tobacco smoking. Although simple correlation analysis first showed that placental EROD activity was correlated with PCB 153 plasma concentration in the Nunavik group, a multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate a significant contribution of PCBs to EROD activity when tobacco smoking was included in the analysis. We conclude that dietary exposure to PCBs in Inuit women from Nunavik does not significantly influence EROD activity in the placenta, implicating tobacco smoking as the major modulating factor.
22051344	Investigators have typically relied on a single or few discrete time points as measures of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) body burden, however health effects are more likely to be the result of integrative exposure in time, optionally expressed as an area under the time curve (AUC) of PCB serum concentration. Using data from a subgroup of 93 infants from a birth cohort in eastern Slovakia-a region highly polluted by PCBs-we fit a system type model, customized to our longitudinal measures of serum PCB concentrations in cord, 6, 16, and 45 month blood specimens. The most abundant congener, PCB 153, was chosen for modeling purposes. In addition to currently used methods of exposure assessment, our approach estimates a concentration time profile for each subject, taking into account mean residence time of PCB 153 molecules in the body, duration of breast feeding, hypothetical PCB 153 concentration in steady-state without breast feeding and alternately without normal food intake. Hypothetical PCB 153 concentration in steady-state without normal food intake correlates with AUC (r=0.84, p<0.001) as well as with duration of breast feeding (r=0.64, p<0.001). It makes possible to determine each subject's exposure profile expressed as AUC of PCBs serum concentration with a minimum model parameters. PCB body burden in most infants was strongly associated with duration of breast feeding in most, but not all children, was apparent from model output.
20123616	BACKGROUND: Prenatal and postnatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) exposure has been associated with decrements in fetal and infant growth and development, although exposures during the preconception window have not been examined despite recent evidence suggesting that this window may correspond with the highest serum concentrations. OBJECTIVES: We assessed maternal serum PCB concentrations at two sensitive developmental windows in relation to birth weight. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 99 women as they began trying to become pregnant (preconception) and after a positive pregnancy test (prenatal); 52 (53%) women gave birth and represent the study cohort. Using daily diaries, women recorded sexual intercourse, menstruation, and home pregnancy test results until pregnant or up to 12 menstrual cycles with intercourse during the estimated fertile window. With gas chromatography with electron capture, 76 PCB congeners were quantified (nanograms per gram serum) and subsequently categorized by purported biologic activity. Serum PCBs were log-transformed and entered both as continuous and categorized exposures along with birth weight (grams) and covariates [smoking (yes/no), height (inches), and infant sex (male/female)] into linear regression. RESULTS: A substantial reduction in birth weight (grams) was observed for women in the highest versus the lowest tertile of preconception antiestrogenic PCB concentration (beta; = 429.3 g, p = 0.038) even after adjusting for covariates (beta; = 470.8, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These data reflect the potential developmental toxicity of antiestrogenic PCBs, particularly during the sensitive preconception critical window among women with environmentally relevant chemical exposures, and underscore the importance of PCB congener-specific investigation. 
17988715	To determine the distribution of persistent organochlorine compounds in beef cattle, concentrations of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs were measured in the blood, testes and adipose tissue of four two-month-old Japanese Black calves. Of 29 congeners analyzed, 19, 20 and 28 were detected in the blood, testes and adipose tissue, respectively, of three or all calves. Total toxic equivalents (TEQs) were similar in the testes and adipose tissue, and approximately two times higher than in the blood on a lipid weight basis (P<0.05). More PCDDs and PCDFs had accumulated in the testes than in adipose tissue (P<0.01), but more dioxin-like PCBs were found in adipose tissue than in the testes (P<0.0001). Accumulation patterns in the testes and adipose tissue varied among the congeners of PCDD and PCDF, whereas the patterns were similar in dioxin-like PCBs. In particular, highly substituted PCDD congeners were detected at high concentrations in the testes but at lower concentrations in adipose tissue compared with other congeners. By contrast, accumulation levels of highly substituted PCDFs were lower in both those tissues than the other congeners. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs leave the circulation and accumulate in the testes and adipose tissue in bovine calves. It was suggested that congeners of PCDD, especially highly substituted PCDDs, and PCDFs have a tendency to accumulate in the testis and dioxin-like PCB congeners accumulate readily in adipose tissue.
7624895	Perinatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixtures or to certain ortho-substituted PCB congeners dramatically reduces circulating thyroxine (T4) concentrations. It is not clear whether perinatal exposure to coplanar PCBs or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has a similar effect. In this study, time-mated Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with 2 or 8 mg/kg/day PCB 77 (3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl), 0.25 or 1.00 micrograms/kg/day PCB 126 (3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), 0.025 or 0.10 microgram/kg/day TCDD, or corn oil vehicle orally on gestation days 10-16. At weaning, plasma total T4 concentrations in PCB 77 and TCDD high-dose female pups were significantly depressed, but the changes were modest (84.4 and 79.6% of control, respectively). T4 concentrations in PCB 126 high-dose females and all high-dose males were also depressed slightly, but the changes were not statistically significant. UDP-Glucuronosyl transferase (UDP-GT) activity towards 4-nitrophenol was increased in all high-dose groups. Thus, the modest decreases in T4 could be due in part to increased T4 glucuronidation by UDP-GT. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were unchanged in all groups. In contrast to the minor changes in thyroid hormone status, liver microsomal ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) was markedly induced in all exposure groups and thymus weights were depressed in the high-dose groups. Because doses of coplanar PCBs or TCDD that caused marked induction of EROD activity had only minor effects on T4, we conclude that changes in thyroid hormone status at weaning are not among the more sensitive effects of perinatal exposure to these compounds.
14754569	In Wisconsin, consumption of Great Lakes fish is an important source of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and other halogenated hydrocarbons, all of which may act as potential risk factors for breast cancer. We examined the association between sport-caught fish consumption and breast cancer incidence as part of an ongoing population-based case-control study. We identified breast cancer cases 20-69 years of age who were diagnosed in 1998-2000 (n = 1,481) from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System. Female controls of similar age were randomly selected from population lists (n = 1,301). Information about all sport-caught (Great Lakes and other lakes) fish consumption and breast cancer risk factors was obtained through telephone interviews. After adjustment for known and suspected risk factors, the relative risk of breast cancer for women who had recently consumed sport-caught fish was similar to women who had never eaten sport-caught fish [relative risk (RR) = 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-1.17]. Frequency of consumption and location of sport-caught fish were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Recent consumption of Great Lakes fish was not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.07), whereas risk associated with premenopausal breast cancer was elevated (RR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16-2.50). In this study we found no overall association between recent consumption of sport-caught fish and breast cancer, although there may be an increased breast cancer risk for subgroups of women who are young and/or premenopausal.
10581696	Individual congener and total PCB concentrations were determined in serum and follicular fluid obtained from women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (in-vitro fertilization and embryo replacement). Although the mean individual PCB levels revealed varying degrees of contamination, the results fall in the same range as that observed by other investigators. Except for PCB 118, correlations between levels in serum and follicular fluid were strong, and statistically significant at p < 0.05. Moreover PCB 153, a major and very stable PCB congener has been shown to correlate to the total amount of PCBs (r = 0.994, and r = 0.987, for serum and follicular fluid, respectively). The same accumulation patterns of PCBs for serum and follicular fluid have been observed.
11991632	Exposure to planar congeners of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) leads to a myriad of toxicities, including developmental, reproductive, and immunotoxic effects. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons possessing structural similarity to TCDD, such as 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), are more prevalent in the environment than TCDD, and they elicit similar toxic effects, primarily through the cytosolic aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). While polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous pollutants, they rarely exist alone in the environment. The aquatic biocide tributyltin (TBT) is also a widespread environmental contaminant, and numerous studies indicate that it has reproductive, developmental, and immunotoxic effects in a variety of organisms. Unlike planar HAHs, TBT is not associated with any known cellular receptor. The induction of cytochrome P-4501A (CYP1A) activity in most vertebrates is a classical physiological response to planar HAH exposure. TBT has been shown to inhibit the induction of cytochrome P-4.50s at high doses. Recent studies demonstrate that low levels of TBT potentiate PCB-126-associated CYP1A induction in channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, and in rodents following intraperitoneal injections. In this study, the effects of dietary exposures to TBT, PCB-126, and mixtures of the two on channel catfish hepatic CYP1A activity, as well as plasma lysozyme activity, were examined. Circulating lysozyme, a marker of proinflammatory responses, was monitored to determine the relative specificity of treatments for CYP1A induction. Plasma lysozyme levels were examined along with hepatic CYP1A protein induction and EROD activity following exposure to nominal doses of 1 and 100 ppb dietary TBT, PCB-126, or mixtures of the two. As expected, the highest level of PCB-126 induced CYP1A, and TBT did not. In mixtures, the low level of TBTpotentiated the ability of the high PCB-126 dose to induce CYP1A. Plasma lysozyme levels were suppressed by both concentrations of TBT and by the low concentrations of PCB- 126 during the initial phase of the response to Vibrio anguillarum. The normal and expected pattern of initial increases in circulating lysozyme levels following immunization, with subsequent return to baseline level, was disrupted by TBT. High levels of PCB-126 potentiated the lysozyme response. As seen with CYP1A activities, exposures to mixtures of TBT and PCB-126 resulted in a potentiation of plasma lysozyme levels. The data show that dietary TBT modulates PCB- 126-induced CYP1A activities and that these mixtures may have potent proinflammatory properties as well.
22430883	Concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Aroclor 1260, and 26 congeners were measured in liver, fat, and eggs of red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) collected from ponds near or on the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), Kentucky, USA. Concentrations of total PCBs (wet mass) ranged from 0.002 to 0.480 mg/kg, 0.028 to 0.839 mg/kg, and 0.001 to 0.011 mg/kg in liver, fat, and eggs, respectively. Concentrations of Arochlor 1260 did not exceed 0.430, 0.419, and 0.007 mg/kg in liver, fat, and eggs, respectively. Exposure to PCBs in red-eared sliders collected from the PGDP is characterized by low concentrations of moderately chlorinated mono-ortho and di-ortho congeners (PCB 153, 180, and 118). Although PCB concentrations measured in the current study were low, chronic exposure to PCBs may have altered hematology and immunity of the turtles examined. Total white blood cell count and number of heterophils were negatively correlated with concentrations of total PCBs and Arochlor 1260, respectively. However, disease and other contaminants in the study area may influence the results. Because little is known regarding the influence of PCBs on hematology and immune function in turtles, additional study is needed to better evaluate results observed in the current study.
11815761	OBJECTIVES: Dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), toxic contaminants known to be persistent in the environment, may affect growth. We investigated whether growth from birth to 10 years of age is associated with blood concentrations of DDE and PCB taken at 8 years of age. STUDY DESIGN: We ambispectively followed up a cohort of 343 German children. DDE and PCB blood concentrations were determined in 1995. Height measurements were conducted prospectively between 1994 and 1997 and obtained retrospectively from each Child's Health Card. Linear regression models for repeated measurements, controlling for confounding factors, were applied. RESULTS: Growth was significantly reduced by an average of 1.8 cm (P <.0275) for girls in the highest DDE concentration quartile (>.44 microg/L in whole blood) compared with girls in the lowest quartile (0.08-0.2 microg/L). There was no observed growth effect of DDE in boys. PCB blood concentrations were not related to growth reduction in either girls or boys. CONCLUSIONS: Background level concentrations to DDE, but not PCB, during childhood are associated with a small reduction in growth for girls evident through the age of 8 years. The observed differences narrow at the year 9 examination and disappear at the year 10 examination. No effects on boys' heights were observed. 
9405123	Activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis is characteristic of stress responses, which may result from a variety of environmental challenges. To investigate whether the stress response, and in particular the HPI axis, in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) is compromised by short-term exposure to PCB 126, fish of both sexes were fed diets containing PCB 126 (50 microg/kg fish . day) for 5 days. In the first approach, which was performed twice, fish were acutely stressed for periods varying between 1 and 30 min at the end of the exposure period; in the second approach fish were sampled at the end of the exposure period either at rest or after 2 h of stress (confinement). After 5 days, the body weights in all experiments were significantly lower in PCB-fed fish than in control fish. There were no changes in basal plasma glucose levels, plasma ion concentrations, or branchial, renal, and intestinal Na,K-ATPase activity following PCB exposure. In the first experimental approach, in which fish experienced acute sampling stress, plasma cortisol levels reached lower levels in PCB-fed fish than in controls. This suggests an impaired ability to acutely activate interrenal steroidogenesis in PCB-treated tilapia. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)- and cAMP-stimulated in vitro cortisol release from superfused head kidneys was lower in tissues from tilapia exposed to PCB 126 than in tissues from control animals. This effect persisted after 24 h in vitro, which, together with the high PCB 126 concentrations measured in the head kidneys of PCB-fed fish, may indicate direct toxic effects on the interrenal cells. The second experimental approach demonstrated that basal plasma cortisol and ACTH levels were not influenced by PCB treatment, but that the basal ACTH content of the rostral pars distalis (RPD) of the pituitary gland of PCB-fed fish was lower than that of control fish. After 2 h confinement, plasma cortisol levels and ACTH content of the RPD rose to similar values in both groups, whereas plasma ACTH levels were higher in confined PCB-fed fish than in confined controls. PCB-fed fish showed a lower hyperglycemic response to confinement than control fish. Confinement resulted in similarly elevated renal and intestinal Na,K-ATPase activities in both PCB-fed and control fish; branchial enzyme activities were not affected. Since PCB did not affect Na,K-ATPase activities and plasma ion concentrations, it is concluded that the effects of PCB 126 on the HPI axis in tilapia are not secondary to ionoregulatory dysfunction.
15471095	External and internal exposure to six WHO-indicator congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) as well as subjective health complaints of a group of 377 pupils attending a PCB-contaminated school were compared with a control group of 218 pupils attending a non-contaminated school. Indoor air of the contaminated school revealed total PCB concentrations (sum of six indicator congeners times 5) ranging between 690 and 20,800 ng/m3 (median 2044 ng/m3). The lower chlorinated congeners PCB 28, 52, 101 were the prevailing contaminants (median 33, 293, and 66 ng/m3). Using improved analytical procedures at least one of the lower chlorinated congeners could be detected in 95% of the blood samples of pupils attending the contaminated school. Median concentrations for PCB 28, 52, 101, and for the sum of lower chlorinated congeners were 6, 9, 5, and 22 ng/l blood plasma, respectively, whereas the corresponding values in the control group were all < 1 ng/l. In contrast, no significant differences were found for the higher chlorinated congeners (PCB 138, 153, 180) which were detected in 1-2 orders of magnitude higher concentrations in both groups. Due to the dietary intake of these congeners similar total PCB levels were found (95th percentile 1070 and 1010 ng/l plasma in participants of the contaminated and control school). Using the Giessen Subjective Complaint List for Children and Adolescents no statistically significant differences in health complaints were observed between both groups of children. It is concluded that exposure of pupils to PCB in indoor air of the contaminated school caused increased blood concentrations of lower chlorinated congeners. Compared to background levels the detected excess body burden was very low indicating no additional health risk. Exposure was not associated to any specific subjective complaints.
8841762	Consumption of fish and shellfish from contaminated areas may be an important source of human exposure to persistent organohalogen compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). We determined concentrations of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs and PCDFs and 19 PCB congeners in whole blood samples from three groups of men, 40-54 years of age, with different consumption levels of crabs from a fjord area in southern Norway polluted with organochlorine compounds from a magnesium production plant. A significant increase of many PCDD/PCDF congeners was found in the blood when comparing the referents, moderate-, and high-intake groups. The greatest difference was observed for several of the PCDFs that are characteristic for the contamination of the marine biota of the fjord. PCBs, in general, play a minor role in the contamination of the fjord by the magnesium production process, except for the highly chlorinated congeners such as PCB-209. Nevertheless, almost all PCBs increased from the referents to the high-intake group. However, the relative concentrations of several highly chlorinated PCBs (particularly PCB-209) in blood are unexpectedly low compared to their abundance in crabs, indicating low uptake of these congeners. The exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs from crab consumption calculated from individual body burdens of these compounds were in good agreement with the intake estimated from previously measured concentrations in crabs, reported fishing sites, and consumption. Almost all subjects in the high-intake group exceeded the tolerable weekly intake of 35 pg TEQ/kg body weight/week proposed by a Nordic Expert Group.
8516785	Time-mated Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to PCB 28 (2,4,4'-trichlorobiphenyl), 8 or 32 mg/kg/day; PCB 118 (2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl), 4 or 16 mg/kg/day; or PCB 153 (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl), 16 or 64 mg/kg/day. At weaning, serum thyroxine (T4) was markedly depressed in pups, but not dams, exposed to PCB 118 or 153. Triiodothyronine (T3) was unchanged in pups and dams. In a histological evaluation of thyroids, the PCB 118 pups revealed changes suggestive of sustained TSH stimulation, including increased follicular cell vacuolization and height, increased nuclear vesiculation, and decreased colloid area. Decreases in body and brain weights and increases in liver weights were observed in some groups, with the high dose PCB 118 pups showing the greatest effect.
23500409	We report on the pilot study carried out before the start of the Elfe project (French longitudinal study from childhood). A total of 44 samples of mature human milk were collected at home 8 weeks after delivery. A total of 7 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), 10 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), 12 dioxin-like (DL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 6 non dioxin-like (NDL)-PCBs were measured. For total TEQ (PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs), the geometric mean concentration was 17.81 pg TEQ(WHO05)/g lipids. Relative PCDD, PCDF, and DL-PCB contributions to the arithmetic mean TEQ(WHO05) were 38%, 18%, and 44%, respectively. The use of TEF(WHO05) instead of TEF(WHO98) resulted in a 27% reduction of the total TEQ value. Although PCDD levels did not significantly change (less than 0.5% increase), PCDF and DL-PCB levels both decreased by 35% and 38%, respectively. Levels have been compared to data obtained during a previous non-reported national study conducted in 1998 (TEF(WHO98)) in French lactaria (n=244). The mean of PCDD/Fs has decreased about 39.4% (18.8 pg TEQ(WHO98)/g lipids in 1998 vs 11.4 pg TEQ(WHO98)/g lipids in pilot study), respectively 41.5% for PCDDs (10.6 pg TEQ(WHO98)/g lipids in 1998 vs 6.2 pg TEQ(WHO98)/g lipids in pilot study) and 36.7% for PCDFs (7.9 pg TEQ(WHO98)/g lipids in 1998 vs 5.0 pg TEQ(WHO98)/g lipids in pilot study). For the sum of the 6 NDL-PCBs, the 2007 geometric mean concentration in milk was 176.3 ng/g lipids. The arithmetic mean lipid concentration in 2007 breast milk was 26.4 g/l (range from 6.0 to 46.7 g/l). A PCDD/F and DL-PCB daily intake was estimated to be 62.3 pg TEQ(WHO05)/kg body weight per day (85.0 pg TEQ(WHO98)/kg body weight per day) for a baby of 5 kg of body weight fed daily with 700 ml of maternal milk containing 25 g/l of lipids.
21698361	INTRODUCTION: Concentrations and congener profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) in placenta samples from a Madrid population (Spain) are reported. Structure dependent retentions of OH-PCBs are known to occur in both humans and wildlife, making it of interest to assess placental transfer of both parent compounds and their metabolites to the developing foetus. RESULTS: The ΣPCB concentrations found in placenta samples were in the range 943-4,331 pg/g fresh weight (f.w.), and their hydroxylated metabolites showed a 20-time lower concentration level (53-261 pg/g f.w.). The PCB profiles were surprisingly dominated by CB-52 and CB-101 accounting for more than 44% of the total PCB concentration. This is indicating a source of exposure that is not yet identified. The OH-PCB profiles were dominated by 4-OH-CB187 and 4-OH-CB146, representing >50% of the ΣOH-PCB concentration of the placenta samples. Statistical analysis of the data revealed strong correlations between the PCB congeners, among some OH-PCBs, and between OH-PCB metabolites with a meta- and para- substitution pattern. Both PCB and OH-PCB concentrations presented homogeneous distribution, what allowed the establishment of a partial least squares model that correlated the concentrations of OH-PCB with those of PCBs in placenta samples. In addition, causal correlations were observed between the concentrations of OH-PCBs and those of their corresponding PCB precursors. 
12361940	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins are known as neurotoxic compounds that may modulate sex steroid hormones. Steroid hormones play a mediating role in brain development and may influence behaviors that show sex differences, such as childhood play behavior. In this study we evaluated the effects of perinatal exposure to environmental levels of PCBs and dioxins on childhood play behavior and whether the effects showed sex differences. As part of the follow-up to the Dutch PCB/dioxin study at school age, we used the Pre-School Activity Inventory (PSAI) to assess play behavior in the Rotterdam cohort (n = 207). The PSAI assesses masculine or feminine play behavior scored on three subscales: masculine, feminine, and composite. Prenatal exposure to PCBs was defined as the sum of PCB 118, 138, 153, and 180 in maternal and cord plasma and breast milk. For breast milk we measured additional PCBs as well as 17 dioxins. Respondents returned 160 questionnaires (age 7.5 years +/- 0.4). Effects of prenatal exposure to PCBs, measured in maternal and cord plasma, on the masculine and composite scales were different for boys and girls (p <.05). In boys, higher prenatal PCB levels were related with less masculinized play, assessed by the masculine scale (p(maternal) =.042; p(cord) =.001) and composite scale (p(cord) =.011), whereas in girls higher PCB levels were associated with more masculinized play, assessed by the composite scale (p(PCBmilk) =.028). Higher prenatal dioxin levels were associated with more feminized play in boys as well as girls, assessed by the feminine scale (p =.048). These effects suggest prenatal steroid hormone imbalances caused by prenatal exposure to environmental levels of PCBs, dioxins, and other related organochlorine compounds.
11485834	Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was examined by analysis of cord tissue from 435 children from a Faroese birth cohort. Analysis of 50 paired cord blood samples showed excellent correlation with the cord tissue concentration (r=.90). Among 17 neuropsychological outcomes determined at age 7 years, the cord PCB concentration was associated with deficits on the Boston Naming Test (without cues, two-tailed P=.09 not adjusted for mercury; with cues, P=.03), the Continuous Performance Test reaction time (P=.03), and, possibly, on long-term recall on the California Verbal Learning Test (P=.15). The association between cord PCB and cord-blood mercury (r=.42) suggested possible confounding. While no PCB effects were apparent in children with low mercury exposure, PCB-associated deficits within the highest tertile of mercury exposure indicated a possible interaction between the two neurotoxicants. PCB-associated increased thresholds were seen at two of eight frequencies on audiometry, but only on the left side, and no deficits occurred on evoked potentials or contrast sensitivity. The limited PCB-related neurotoxicity in this cohort appears to be affected by concomitant methylmercury exposure.
20673887	As factors affecting neonatal neurodevelopment, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and maternal seafood intake reflecting n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are believed to have adverse or beneficial effects, but there are a few reports addressing such factors simultaneously. We carried out a birth cohort study to clarify the effects of these three factors on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), administered 3 days after birth. In a total of 498 mother-neonate pairs, the total mercury level (median, 1.96microg/g) in maternal hair at parturition and the summation operatorPCB level (45.5ng/g-lipid) in cord blood were analyzed, and maternal seafood intake was estimated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. A negative relationship between the hair mercury level and the motor cluster of NBAS was observed, even after adjusting for PCBs, maternal seafood intake, and possible confounders such as maternal age, birth weight, and parity. The summation operatorPCB level was negatively correlated with the motor cluster, but this association was attenuated after adjusting for mercury and the confounders. There was seen to be a positive association between maternal seafood intake and the motor cluster when considering the effects of mercury and PCBs. In conclusion, our data suggest that prenatal exposure to methylmercury adversely affects neonatal neurobehavioral function; in contrast, maternal seafood intake appears to be beneficial. The neurobehavioral effect of prenatal exposure to PCBs remains unclear in our study. Further research is necessary to elucidate interactive effects of methylmercury, PCBs, and n-3 PUFAs, originating from fish, on child neurodevelopment.
22345314	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widespread environmental contaminants found in seafood and dairy products. PCBs and PBDEs are structurally similar chemicals and affect thyroid hormone function and behavior in children and laboratory rodents. Although coexposure frequently exists, the in vivo developmental effects of combined exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on thyroxine (T4) levels are unknown. We examined the effects of PCB and PBDE coexposure from gestational day 6 through postnatal day (p) 21, alone and in combination, on T4 levels in rat offspring. In males, exposure to PCBs and PBDEs at 1.7, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μmol/kg/day induced equivalent and dose-dependent reductions in T4 from p 7 to p 21. Exposure to equimolar mixtures of PCBs and PBDEs at 3.4, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/kg/day additively reduced T4 from p 7 to p 21 in males. In a second series of experiments, we determined sex effects on the mixture exposures and found that coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs had similar additive effects on T4 levels in male and female offspring. This study demonstrates that equimolar exposure to PCBs and PBDEs induces similar reductions in T4 levels and that coexposure to a mixture of PCBs and PBDEs has additive effects on T4 levels. These thyroid hormone effects of coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs are important when considering the cumulative effects of coexposure to multiple environmental thyroid hormone-disrupting agents in risk assessment for developmental disorders.
18626891	Forty years have passed since the accidental poisoning with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in Japan in 1968, named Yusho. High concentrations of PCB are still detected in the serum of the Yusho victims. PCB produces superoxide (O(2) (-)) in the metabolic process and we reported high concentrations of serum nitrite, a stable metabolite reflecting nitric oxide (NO), in the Yusho victims. NO reacts with O(2) (-) and immediately produces peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). ONOO(-) causes nitration of tyrosine residues and produces nitrotyrosine (NT). Therefore, we measured urinary concentrations of nitrite and NT in the victims and age-matched controls. The mean urinary concentrations of nitrite and NT were significantly higher than in the controls. There was a positive correlation between urinary nitrite and NT in the Yusho victims. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the ratio of urinary NT to nitrite and serum PCB concentrations in the Yusho victims. It was considered that the emergence of some ailments could be presumed to have been caused by high levels of urinary nitrite and NT in the Yusho victims.
17280759	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous and persistent environmental contaminants that disturb normal endocrine functions including gonadal functions in humans and mammals. The present study was conducted to elucidate the protective role of vitamins C and E against Aroclor 1254-induced changes in Leydig cell steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and steroidogenic enzymes mRNA expression. Adult male rats were dosed for 30 days with daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 2 mg/kg Aroclor 1254 or vehicle (corn oil). One group of rats was treated with vitamin C (100 mg/kg bw day) while the other group was treated with vitamin E (50 mg/kg bw day) orally, simultaneously with Aroclor 1254 for 30 days. One day after the last treatment, animals were euthanized and blood was collected for the assay of serum hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and estradiol. The serum androgen binding protein was also estimated. Testes were quickly removed and Leydig cells were isolated in aseptic condition. Purity of Leydig cells was determined by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) staining methods. Purified Leydig cells were used for quantification of androgen and estrogen receptors. In addition, total RNA was isolated from control and treated Leydig cells to monitor the steady-state mRNA levels by RT-PCR for StAR protein, cytochrome P(450)scc, 3beta-HSD and 17beta-HSD. Aroclor 1254 treatment significantly reduced the serum LH, FSH, testosterone, estradiol and androgen binding protein. In addition to this, Leydig cell androgen and estrogen receptors were markedly decreased. RT-PCR analysis of StAR mRNA level did not alter Aroclor 1254 treatment while steroidogenic enzymes such as cytochrome P(450)scc, 3beta-HSD and 17beta-HSD mRNAs were drastically decreased in Aroclor 1254 treatment. However, the simultaneous administration of vitamins C or E in Aroclor 1254-exposed rats resulted a significant restoration of all the above-mentioned parameters to the control level. These observations suggest that vitamins C and E have ameliorative role against PCBs-induced testicular Leydig cells dysfunction.
22564984	Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been associated with changes in reproductive hormone levels, however most groups studied have been highly exposed. We investigated the association of PCBs, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and p, p'-DDE with serum sex hormones in 341 adult men from a US infertility clinic with exposure levels consistent with those observed in the general population. In crude regression models we observed several negative associations of PCBs and HCB with steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and total and free testosterone. After adjustment for lipids, age and BMI, nearly all significant associations were attenuated. A negative relationship remained between PCB 118 and SHBG (p<0.01), and relationships of dioxin-like PCBs with SHBG and total testosterone, and between PCB 118 and total testosterone, were suggestive. These results suggest a minimal relationship between PCB exposures at low background levels similar to those observed in the general population of the US and circulating reproductive hormones.
20718467	Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed for the most persistent polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB 153) in male and female harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) to elucidate processes such as uptake, distribution, and elimination. Due to its limited metabolic capacities, long life span, and top position in marine food chains, this species is highly sensitive to pollution. The models consist of 5 compartments, liver, blubber, kidney, brain, and a compartment which accounts for the rest of the body, all connected through blood. All physiological and biochemical parameters were extracted from the literature, except for the brain/blood partition coefficient and rate of excretion, which were both fitted to data sets used for validation of the models. These data sets were compiled from our own analyses performed with GC-MS on tissue samples of harbor porpoises. The intake of PCB 153 was from milk from birth to 4 months, and after weaning fish was the main food source. Overall, these models reveal that concentrations of PCB 153 in males increase with age but suggest that, as the animals grow older, metabolic transformation can be a possible pathway for elimination as well. In contrast, the model for females confirms that gestation and lactation are key processes for eliminating PCB 153 as body burdens decrease with age. These PBPK models are capable of simulating the bioaccumulation of PCB 153 during the entire life span of approximately 20 years of the harbor porpoises.
3138502	PCBs are nearly ubiquitous environmental contaminants, occurring in most human adipose tissue and blood samples. It has recently been recognized that PCBs and related compounds share important structural properties with thyroid hormones and can bind thyroid hormone binding proteins. It is reasonable that such specific binding interactions can modulate the distribution of these compounds in the body and alter hormone-protein interactions that are responsible for the maintenance of normal thyroid status. Most of the available evidence indicates that the levels of free thyroid hormones in plasma are a reflection of the maintenance of normal thyroid status in any individual. A theoretical model for the transport of thyroid hormones in blood has been extended to estimate the modulating effects of PCBs on free thyroid hormones. Using conservative assumptions based on experimental data, our calculations indicate that PCB concentrations normally found in humans can effect significant increases in free thyroxine levels in serum by competing with serum thyroid hormone binding proteins. Experimental data are discussed which support the proposal that antagonist binding of PCBs to thyroid hormone binding proteins in serum could produce varying degrees of hypothyroidism. The biological result is compatible with the "equilibrium hypothesis" in which thyroid hormone redistributes between specific and nonspecific binding proteins rather than emphasizing the importance of free hormone as the active moiety.
22686300	In spring 2010, high internal exposures (up to 236 μg/L plasma) for the sum of indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were discovered in workers in a transformer recycling company in Germany, where PCB-contaminated material was not handled according to proper occupational hygiene. The release of PCB from this company raised growing concerns regarding possible adverse human health effects correlated with this exposure. This provided a basis for a large biological monitoring study in order to examine the internal exposure to PCB in individuals working in that recycling company, their family members, and relatives, as well as subjects working or living in the surroundings of this company. Blood samples from 116 individuals (formerly) employed in the transformer recycling company and 45 direct relatives of these persons were obtained. Further, blood samples of 190 subjects working in close vicinity of the recycling plant, 277 persons working in the larger area, and 41 residents of the area were investigated. Plasma samples were analyzed for the 6 indicator PCB (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) and 12 dioxin-like PCB using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS; limit of detection [LOD] at 0.01 μg/L). Median concentrations (maximum) for the sum of the 6 indicator PCB in blood of the employees, their relatives, individuals working in close vicinity, persons working in the larger area, and the residents were 3.68 (236.3), 1.86 (22.8), 1.34 (22.9), 1.19 (6.42), and 0.85 (7.22) μg/L plasma, respectively. The (former) employees of the transformer recycling plant partly showed the highest plasma PCB levels determined thus far in Germany. Even family members displayed highly elevated levels of PCB in blood due to contaminations of their homes by laundering of contaminated clothes. Vicinity to the recycling plant including reported contact with possibly contaminated scrap was the main contributor to the PCB levels of the workers of the surrounding companies. Residents of the area did not show significantly elevated blood PCB levels compared to the general population. Our biomonitoring results served as a basis for individual risk communication and successful risk management.
15513976	BACKGROUND: Hormonally active environmental agents have recently been associated with the development of endometriosis. METHODS: We undertook a study to assess the relationship between endometriosis, an estrogen-dependent gynaecological disease, and 62 individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners. We enrolled 84 eligible women aged 18-40 years undergoing laparoscopy for study, which included an interview and blood specimen (n=79; 94%). Thirty-two women had visually confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy while 52 did not. Blood specimens were run in batches of 14 including four quality control samples for toxicological analysis. Each PCB congener was adjusted for recovery; batch-specific reagent blanks were subtracted. All PCB concentrations were log transformed and expressed in ng/g serum first as a sum and then as tertiles by purported estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity of PCB congeners. RESULTS: Using unconditional logistic regression analysis, a significantly elevated odds ratio (OR) was observed for women in the third tertile of anti-estrogenic PCBs [OR 3.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-12.68]. Risk remained elevated after controlling for gravidity, current cigarette smoking and serum lipids (OR 3.30; 95% CI 0.87-12.46). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that anti-estrogenic PCBs may be associated with the development of endometriosis. 
21106193	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent and toxic compounds that have been detected in human serum or tissues worldwide. The objective of our study was to determine serum PCB levels in a representative sample of the general population of the Spanish Archipelago of the Canary Islands (607 serum samples from subjects aged between 6 and 75 years) in order to establish the main causes of this contamination and to evaluate the potential risks posed by these chemicals on the population through the use of toxicity equivalence to dioxins (TEQs). PCB congeners (28, 52, 77, 81, 101, 105, 114, 118, 123, 126, 138, 153, 156, 157, 167, 169, 180, and 189) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Our results showed that PCB residues were found in 76% of serum samples analyzed, with the congeners 153 and 180 being the most frequently detected and having the highest median values (21.8 and 6.7 ng/g lipid, respectively). Serum levels of non-dioxin-like PCBs increased with age, body mass index (BMI), urban habitat, and smoking. The median concentration of the sum of PCBs considered as markers of environmental contamination by these chemicals (M-PCBs) was 46.4 ng/g lipid. Levels of the sum of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) were 48.5 ng/g lipid in the 95th percentile, and were also positively associated with age. As a consequence, age seemed to be positively associated with TEQs levels, reaching values as high as 58.6 pg/g lipid in the serum samples from oldest people. Our results indicate that the inhabitants of the Canary Archipelago show levels of PCB contamination lower than other populations present on the Spanish mainland, as well as many populations from developed countries. Nevertheless, as these compounds may induce adverse health effects even at very low doses, our findings should be considered by local Public Health authorities in order to establish measures for diminishing the exposure of the population of these islands to PCBs.
8277528	Fifty-five Yu-Cheng (oil-disease) children born between 1978 and 1985 to mothers who ate PCB-contaminated rice oil in 1978-1979 were studied and compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects in 1991. The children's growth profiles, bone mineral density and soft tissue composition, joint laxity, and serum parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphate were compared. The Yu-Cheng children were 3.1 cm (p < .05) smaller and had less total lean mass and soft tissue mass as compared to the matched control subjects. All other parameters studied were similar in both groups. The shorter height and decreased total lean mass and soft tissue content were only seen in the Yu-Cheng children who were the first born after the ingestion, but not in subsequent children. This was most likely due to decreased body burdens of the PCBs and related contaminants over time in the mothers.
811460	Forty adult male white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were divided into four equal groups and fed diets containing 0, 100, 200 or 400 p.p.m. of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) for 2 weeks. PCB ingestion increased liver weights and reduced pentobarbital-induced sleeping times at all levels tested, indicating increased hepatic microsomal enzyme activity. Plasma corticoid levels, seminal vesicle weights and testicular spermatozoa numbers were reduced at the 400 p.p.m. level.
11315225	BACKGROUND: From 1978 to 1979, a group of people in Taiwan were exposed to high levels of heat-degraded polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) owing to accidental ingestion of contaminated rice oil. Children born to mothers following the exposure ('Yucheng' children) were known to have hyperpigmented skin and other dysmorphology after birth. AIMS: To determine the effect of prenatal exposure to PCBs on cognitive development in Yucheng children. METHOD: One hundred and eighteen Yucheng children prenatally exposed to PCBs and degradation products, and community-matched control children who were exposed to background levels only, were followed from 1985 to 1998. The Bayley Scale for Infant Development, Chinese version of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test, Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and Raven's Standardised Progressive Matrices were used to assess the cognitive development of these children. RESULTS: The Yucheng children scored lower than control children on each of these methods of measurement between the ages of 2 and 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to PCBs and their derivatives has long-term adverse effects on cognitive development in humans. 
6797980	Administration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (500 mg Aroclor, 1254/kg body weight) intraperitoneally significantly increased the levels of L-ascorbic acid in the plasma and livers, but not in the lungs of one-month-old male rats maintained on a basal low selenium diet with or without 2.0 ppm selenium (as sodium selenite) supplementation for 19 weeks prior to PCB treatment. The levels of L-ascorbic acid were not significantly altered by dietary selenium. In another experiment, 40 days or 15-month-old male rats were fed the same basal selenium diet with or without 1.0 ppm selenium for 1 month prior to PCB treatment. The plasma levels of ascorbic acid were found to increase significantly by PCB treatment, but not by the status of dietary selenium or by animal age. As expected, the activity of selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase was markedly decreased in the plasma, livers, and lungs of rats fed the low selenium diet. However, the enzyme activity was not significantly altered by PCB treatment in plasma, livers, and lungs of animals in both dietary groups.
3926478	In 1979 in Taiwan, more than 2000 people were poisoned with rice cooking oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). One hundred ten patients were studied within one year of the exposure. The blood PCB levels were 39.3 +/- 16.6 ppb. The blood levels of the PCB derivatives, polychlorinated quaterphenyls (PCQ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), were 8.6 +/- 4.8 and 0.076 +/- 0.038 ppb, respectively. Both the sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities (NCV) of the patients were significantly lower than the control. Abnormal slowing of sensory NCV was found in 43.6% and abnormal slowing of motor NCV was seen in 21.8%. Patients who had higher PCQ blood levels had significantly slower median nerve sensory NCV than those with lower PCQ levels. Patients with higher PCB blood levels had significantly slower peroneal nerve motor NCV than those with lower PCB levels.
9726780	Rat splenocyte mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity, and phagocytic activities of splenic, peritoneal, and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were evaluated in vitro to determine the immunotoxicity of mixtures containing low levels of methylmercury (MeHg), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and Aroclor polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The mixtures were based on the concentrations of the chemicals in fish flesh. Leukocytes from male Fischer rats were exposed to MeHg (0.1-2 microg/ml), PCDD/PCDF mixtures (1-15 pg/ml) of three PCDDs (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and two PCDFs (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran), three Aroclor PCB (Aroclor 1242, 1254, and 1260) mixtures (0.01-0.5 microg/ml), or combinations of MeHg/PCB/PCDD/PCDF mixtures for 24 or 72 h before immunological assays. Phagocytosis and NK cell cytotoxicity were evaluated with a flow cytometer, and MLR of Fischer rat responder splenocytes cultured with mitomycin C-treated Long-Evans splenocytes by [3H]thymidine uptake. Exposure to MeHg (2 microg/ml) alone or with PCB/ PCDD/PCDF resulted in significant cytolethality in rat splenocytes, peritoneal leukocytes, and PBLs at 24 h exposure. Treatment with Aroclor PCB mixtures, PCDD/PCDF mixtures, 0.1 microg MeHg/ml (noncytolethal), or PCB/PCDD/PCDF mixtures with 0.1 microg MeHg/ml caused no suppression of splenocyte MLR response, splenic NK cell-mediated lysis of Yac-l cells, or phagocytosis of fluorescent beads by splenic, peritoneal, and peripheral blood phagocytic cells. The results indicate that in vitro exposure of rat leukocytes to low levels of MeHg, Aroclor PCB mixtures, PCDD/PCDF mixtures, or MeHg/PCB/PCDD/PCDF mixtures had no suppressive effects on the immune functions assayed, and thus produced no additive immunotoxicity. However, in order to predict the potential risk of these chemical mixtures to the human immune system, in vivo animal studies with blood (tissue) levels compatible with the levels of MeHg, PCBs, and PCDDs/PCDFs in exposed human populations should be evaluated.
15533331	Fish consumption may be beneficial for a developing human fetus, but fish may also contain contaminants that could be detrimental. Great Lakes sport-caught fish (GLSCF) are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE), but the effects of these contaminants on birth outcome are not clear. To distinguish potential contaminant effects, we examined (1) whether the decrease over time in contaminant levels in GLSCF is paralleled by an increase in birth weight of children of GLSCF-consuming mothers and (2) the relation between maternal serum concentrations of these contaminants and birth weight. Mothers (n=511) were interviewed from 1993 to 1995, and maternal serum was collected from 1994 to 1995 (n=143). Potential confounders considered were child gender, maternal age at delivery, maternal prepregnancy body mass index, maternal cigarette and alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal education level, maternal parity, and maternal breastfeeding. Children born during 1970-1977, 1978-1984, and 1985-1993 to mothers who ate more than 116 meals of GLSCF before pregnancy were, on average, 164 g lighter, 46 g heavier, and 134 g heavier, respectively, than children of mothers who ate no GLSCF before pregnancy (P trend=0.05). GLSCF-consuming mothers had higher serum PCB and DDE concentrations, but only increased DDE was associated with lower birth weight. The data suggest that fetal DDE exposure (as indicated by maternal serum DDE concentration) may decrease birth weight and that decreased birth weight effects associated with GLSCF consumption have decreased over time.
18795157	BACKGROUND: Bone toxicity has been linked to organochlorine exposure following a few notable poisoning incidents, but epidemiologic studies in populations with environmental organochlorine exposure have yielded inconsistent results. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether organochlorine exposure was associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in a population 60-81 years of age (154 males, 167 females) living near the Baltic coast, close to a river contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). METHODS: We measured forearm BMD in participants using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; and we assessed low BMD using age- and sex-standardized Z-scores. We analyzed blood samples for five dioxin-like PCBs, the three most abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs, and p,p'-dichloro-phenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE). RESULTS: In males, dioxin-like chlorobiphenyl (CB)-118 was negatively associated with BMD; the odds ratio for low BMD (Z-score less than -1) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.12) per 10 pg/mL CB-118. The sum of the three most abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs was positively associated with BMD, but not with a decreased risk of low BMD. In females, CB-118 was positively associated with BMD, but this congener did not influence the risk of low BMD in women. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental organochlorine exposures experienced by this population sample since the 1930s in Sweden may have been sufficient to result in sex-specific changes in BMD. 
23466097	Age- and sex-specific estimates of serum dioxin concentrations are important for comparisons among populations. However, such comparisons are problematic because populations have different age and sex structures and values are typically reported only in broad age ranges that are not comparable across studies. There are few studies that report congener-specific serum concentrations, and none that provide these by sex for age as a continuous function. We combined the NHANES 2003-2004 data with the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study (UMDES) referent population 2005 data to achieve stable and accurate estimates of mean and quantiles of serum dioxins by sex over ages 18-85. Survey-weighted linear and quantile regression models were fitted on the combined data with the log-transformed congener concentration as outcome and age, sex, and data source as covariates. Formulas are provided to allow calculations of age- and sex-specific mean and quantile estimates over ages 18-85. For instance, the geometric mean, median, 75th percentile, and 95th percentile of serum TEQ for men aged 50 can be estimated, respectively, from the formulas as 18.33, 19.02, 22.60, and 30.37 pg g(-1) lipids among the Michigan general population, and as 15.71, 15.89, 22.60, and 29.90 pg g(-1) lipids among US non-Hispanic whites. These methods and results are useful for comparing the congener-specific human serum dioxin concentrations in any individual to the general population mean, median, 75th percentile, and 95th percentile, and for comparing the serum dioxin concentration in any group of interest to the US and the Michigan general populations.
16169054	A prospective birth cohort of 1022 participants was established in the Faroe Islands over a 21-month period during 1986-1987. We collected questionnaire data on potential persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentration predictors, such as duration of breastfeeding and blubber consumption. To assess the participants' exposure from in utero to 14 years of age to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the insecticide p,p'-DDT and its primary degradate p,p'-DDE, we measured 37 PCB congeners and pesticides in 316 umbilical cord samples taken from participants at birth, in 124 serum samples collected from participants at approximately 7 years of age, and in 795 serum samples collected from participants at 14 years of age. Measurements of higher chlorination PCB congeners made on individuals' serum samples collected at 7 years and 14 years were highly correlated (typically r > 0.5, p > 0.01), although their concentrations at 7 years were generally two to three times higher than at 14 years. Similarly, umbilical cord PCB concentrations were correlated with PCB concentrations in both 7- and 14-year serum samples. Sex-specific differences in higher chlorination PCB and p,p'-DDE concentrations were found at 14 years but not at 7 years, although a sex interaction with blubber consumption and nursing duration was observed at both ages. Both duration of breastfeeding and consumption of blubber were significant predictors of serum summationPCB concentrations at 7 and 14 years. Multivariate analyses showed that breastfeeding duration was the primary contributor to serum summationPCB concentrations at 7 years, and blubber consumption was the primary contributor at 14 years. These data suggest that infant exposures from breastfeeding were sufficiently large so that continued exposures to PCBs, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDE through the diet have not fully diluted their contribution to the summationPCB and p,p'-DDE body burden of the children.
17874768	In P.R. China, electronic waste (e-waste) from across the world is dismantled and discarded. Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in serum from residents of an e-waste dismantling region (Guiyu, South China), where 80% of families work in e-waste recycling, and compared to a matching cohort from a nearby region where the fishing industry dominates (Haojiang). Serum concentrations of PBDEs and OCPs, but not PCBs, were significantly different in the two regions: the median sigmaPBDE concentration was 3 times higher in Guiyu than Haojiang, whereas the opposite was true for dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). PBDEs typically accounted for 46% of the total organohalogen chemicals in samples from Guiyu, but 8.7% in Haojiang. The median BDE-209 concentration in Guiyu was 50-200 times higher than previously reported in occupationally exposed populations. The highest BDE-209 concentration was 3100 ng/g lipid, the highest yet reported in humans. Serum PBDE concentrations did not correlate with PCBs or OCPs, whereas PCBs and OCPs showed positive correlations, suggesting that sources of PBDEs to humans are different from PCBs and OCPs. The levels of PBDEs in individuals from Haojiang are possibly related to the recycling activity at Guiyu, through atmospheric transport.
16650462	The levels of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs): p,p'-DDT and its metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), chlordanes and their metabolites, and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were measured in maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and human milk collected from 22 mothers living in the Wielkopolska region, Poland. Additionally, 11 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were measured in the human milk samples. p,p'-DDT and its major metabolite, p,p'-DDE, together with HCB, were found in all milk and serum samples. Median concentrations of p,p'-DDE in maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and milk were 343, 329 and 634ng/g lipid weight (lw). PCB congeners 138, 153 and 180 were the major congeners measured in all serum samples, while CB 170 was detected in 74% and 100% of umbilical cord and maternal serum, respectively. Except for CBs 74, 101 and 105, which had a detection frequency of 77%, 23% and 82%, respectively, all investigated PCB congeners were measured in all human milk samples. The median concentrations of sum PCBs in maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and milk were 79, 60 and 133 ng/g lw, respectively. A good correlation (Spearman R(S)>0.75, p<0.001) was found for major PCBs, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, between maternal and umbilical cord serum, while the correlation was weaker between milk and serum. The median of sum PBDEs in human milk was 2.0 ng/g lw (range 0.8 to 8.4), with BDE 47 being always the most abundant PBDE congener and, together with BDE 153, being present in all samples. In general, results found in the investigated group are at the low end of the concentration range measured in Europe.
23446973	We describe the morphologic and toxicological findings in a case of pansteatitis in a stranded loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta. At necropsy, a large amount of adipose tissue in the celomic cavity showing very firm, yellow to orange irregular formations was observed. Histological lesions ranged from the infiltration of necrotic fat by scarce multinucleated giant cells and numerous macrophages containing xylene-insoluble lipopigment inclusions to the presence of several granulomas characterized by an irregular central necrotic area consisting of lipopigment surrounded by numerous multinucleated giant cells. Microbiological cultures were negative. Celomic fat was analyzed for PCBs and DDTs, resulting in very high levels of PCB 138, 153, 180 209 (3170, 2830, 980 and 1190 ng g-1, respectively). Although a nutritional cause cannot be ruled out, the high levels of PCBs detected in the celomic fat could have induced lipid peroxidation in adipocytes, resulting in cell damage, deposition of ceroid pigment and inflammatory response. This is the first report of pansteatitis in a wild sea turtle.
19339036	Concentrations of persistent contaminants often vary widely among individuals within a population. We hypothesized that such variation was caused mainly by differences in diet (biomagnification) and in coastal systems by the tendency of marine systems to act as contaminant sinks. We examined the relationship between contaminant concentrations and stable isotope ratios in nestling plasma from an apex predator with a particularly broad diet. Our study included freshwater, estuarine, inshore and pelagic breeding sites. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at the pelagic marine sites showed high trophic level and marine input, eagles at the freshwater sites showed low trophic level and marine input, and eagles at the estuarine and inshore marine sites had intermediate values. The relationship between trophic level and marine input may reflect longer food chains in pelagic compared to terrestrial ecosystems. summation operator PCBs and DDE concentrations generally increased with trophic level and marine input, with the exception of the freshwater sites, while summation operator PBDEs, hydroxylated-PBDEs and hydroxylated-PCBs increased with marine input, but were independent of trophic level. The relationships for summation operator PCBs and DDE were often slightly stronger with marine input than trophic level, suggesting that oceanographic processes may be more important than trophic level. At freshwater locations, spatial variation may be more important than trophic level due to the heterogeneity of contaminant profiles between feeding locations (lakes, rivers, agricultural fields). Adults had similar isotopic composition to their chicks but higher contamination. Based on nests where prey composition was determined independently, isotopic enrichment values for nestling plasma were 1.6+/-0.1 (delta(15)N) and -0.4+/-0.2 (delta(13)C). We conclude that trophic level and marine influence are significant factors influencing PCB and DDE concentrations in eagles. However, trophic level in particular did not influence PBDEs, possibly due to their being metabolized by eagles.
10656858	The State of Michigan has a long history of research into human exposure to environmental contaminants through consumption of recreationally caught fish. A large cohort of Lake Michigan residents who eat fish (fish-eaters) and those who do not eat fish (nonfish-eaters) established in 1980 served as the basis for the congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure evaluation reported here. In this paper we present the serum PCB congener profile for a subset of this cohort who were over 50 years of age. Serum samples were collected in 1993-1995 and were evaluated by a dual column capillary column gas chromatography procedure capable of detecting over 90 PCB congeners. This evaluation demonstrated significant PCB exposure in the fish-eaters (mean serum PCB of 14.26 ppb; n = 101). This elevated exposure allowed the establishment of a detailed profile of the PCB congeners found in humans exposed by this route. Twenty-two congeners of varying concentrations were the most prevalent and constituted over 95% of the total PCB present in most subjects. Four congeners, 138/163 (2,2',3,4,4',5-PCB/2,3,3',4', 5,6-PCB), 180 (2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-PCB), and 153 (2,2',4,4',5,5'-PCB), accounted for 55-64% of the total PCB load. Other congeners, some of toxicologic significance, were also detected by this analytical protocol. Nonfish-eaters had lower total serum PCB levels (mean = 4. 56; n = 78), but the same general pattern of PCB congeners was present. It was demonstrated that careful selection of a subset of prevalent PCB congeners could provide a cost-effective assessment of exposure without losing critical scientific information.
8934301	Chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain public health concerns because of their unresolved health impact and their persistence in humans. Current epidemiological studies of cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and endocrine disruption in National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) laboratories require exposure assessment of many analytes in thousands of people. Previous methods of analyzing pesticides and PCBs in serum have proven inadequate for timely processing of the number of samples required for epidemiological studies. A new method that involves solid-phase extraction (SPE) and cleanup followed by dual-column gas chromatographic separation and electron capture detection has been developed. Nine surrogate compounds were added to the serum prior to sample workup to provide quality assurance for the SPE steps. These surrogates mimic the chemistry of the analytes in the extraction, cleanup, and gas chromatographic analysis steps. To increase selectivity, extracts were injected onto two gas chromatographs with different capillary columns, a DB-1701 and a DB-5. Recoveries of 17 pesticides, 28 PCB congeners, and one polybrominated biphenyl congener ranged from 40 to 80%. Recoveries from this procedure were found to be similar to those from the previously used liquid-liquid extraction method. Correlation of analyte and surrogate recoveries were compared to examine the ruggedness of the technique. The SPE method was found to provide improved sample throughput by a factor of 15.
18291442	Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are bioaccumulative chemicals that are considered to be toxic contaminants based on several epidemiological studies. To elucidate exposure levels of these chemicals in the present study, concentrations of PCDD/DFs, dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and PCBs in breast milk, maternal blood and cord blood obtained from the same participants registered in a birth cohort study in Tohoku, Japan, were measured. Congener-specific analysis revealed several differences in minor congeners of these compounds among the three specimen types, although major congeners were detected in the specimens. The toxicity equivalence quantity concentrations (1998 WHO-TEF) and PCBs in breast milk, maternal blood and cord blood on the whole and on a lipid basis were in the order of breast milk > maternal blood > cord blood. Pearson's correlation coefficients of TEQs and total PCBs among the three specimens were high, with the correlation coefficient of TEQ between breast milk and maternal blood being the highest (r=0.94, p<0.001). On the other hand, the TEQ between breast milk and cord blood was the lowest (r=0.79, p<0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient between the TEQ and PCBs in each specimen was also high (r=0.82-0.95, p<0.001). The associations of chemical concentrations with maternal age, parity, fish intake, BMI and the rate of body weight increase during pregnancy were analyzed with multiple linear regression analysis. TEQ concentrations and PCBs were negatively associated with parity (p<0.05), and maternal age was positively associated with PCBs (p<0.05). However, the associations with BMI and fish intake during pregnancy were not significant. These results suggest that parity is an important factor affecting the concentrations of dioxins and PCBs in these specimens.
17051771	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hydroxylated metabolic products (OH-PCBs) were measured in plasma collected from live-captured and released bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from five different locations in the Western Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico in 2003 and 2004. In 2004, the sum (sigma) of concentration of PCBs in plasma of dolphins sampled off Charleston, SC [geometric mean: 223 ng/g of wet weight (w.w.)] was significantly higher (p<0.05) than concentrations detected in animals from the Indian River Lagoon, FL (sigmaPCBs: 122 ng/g w.w.) and the Sarasota Bay, FL (sigmaPCBs: 111 ng/g w.w.). The PCB homolog profiles were similar among locations. Concentrations of OH-PCBs were significantly higher (p<0.05) in plasma of dolphins from Charleston, SC (sigmaOH-PCBs for 2003: 126 ng/g w.w.; 2004: 138 ng/g w.w.) than animals from Florida (sigmaOH-PCBs ranged from 6 to 47 ng/g w.w.) and Bermuda (8.3 ng/g w.w.); however, concentrations in the Charleston samples did not differ from animals captured in Delaware Bay, NJ (57 ng/g w.w.). The sigmaOH-PCBs constituted 2-68% of the total PCB concentrations in plasma. Dichloro- to nonachloro-OH-PCBs were quantified using high-resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry, but only around 20% of OH-PCBs could be identified by comparison to authentic standards. Results from this study show that OH-PCB are important environmental contaminants in dolphins and suggest that PCBs, decades after their ban, may still constitute a threat to wildlife.
3093216	Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in placenta, maternal blood, cord blood, and milk were carried out. Trichlorobiphenyl, tetrachlorobiphenyl, pentachlorobiphenyls, and hexachlorobiphenyls were identified by the mass chromatogram and the mass spectra. Some minor peaks of PCBs were identified by gas chromatography. The relationship between the PCB concentration in placenta and that in milk is different in each PCB congener. The higher the chlorine content of the PCB congener, the more significant the correlation. No significant but a low negative correlation exists between the concentration of some PCB congeners in the placenta and that in cord blood. On the other hand, a significant linear correlation exists between the concentration of hexachlorobenzene in the placenta and that in cord blood. The transplacental transport of each PCB congener varied depending upon its chemical nature. Trichlorobiphenyl and tetrachlorobiphenyl were more transferable than hexachlorobiphenyls. The results show that the placenta and cord blood are useful human samples to analyze the body burden of environmental pollutants and to estimate their transfer from mother to fetus.
20049255	This study examined the association between self-reported diabetes, fish consumption and serum levels of organochlorines in a First Nation community. One quarter of the 101 participants reported diabetes. Serum PCBs, but not p,p'-DDE, were positively correlated to consumption frequency of total fish, walleye and pike, but not trout. Reported diabetes was positively associated to p,p'-DDE and some PCB congeners. Odds Ratios (OR) for reported diabetes for those in the upper 75th percentile for serum p,p'-DDE compared to the others were 3.5 (95% CI 1-13.8) and 6.1 (95% CI 1.4-27.3) (weight wet and lipid-standardized values, respectively) and for total sum of PCBs: 4.91 (95% CI 1.4-19.0) and 5.51 (95% CI 1.3-24.1). For participants who were in the upper 50th percentile for trout and white fish intake, reported diabetes was respectively 6 and 4 times lower compared to the others. These findings support the hypothesis that environmental exposure to elevated p,p'-DDE and PCBs is associated with increased risk of diabetes. Consumption of trout and white fish may be beneficial to reduce risk.
18407315	A pilot study was carried out in Tuscany, Italy, to provide preliminary information on the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs), and selected non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs) in groups of subjects living in the vicinity of two incineration plants. Seventy-four volunteers were enrolled from areas identified as under a potential impact from incinerator emissions and from not exposed areas. No significant differences were observed between subjects living in the two types of areas. Total concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and DL-PCBs resulted to be in the range 23-30 pg WHO-TEQ g(-1), lipid base, for subjects in the 27-54 year age groups, while concentrations increased to 40-44 pgTEQ g(-1) for the two 55-67 year age groups. The levels of PCDDs and PCDFs were in good agreement with those observed for unexposed population groups in Italy, while the contribution to total TEQ from DL-PCBs was appreciably higher than those currently observed in the general population in Italy and other countries. As to NDL-PCBs, serum levels of the six "indicator" congeners were in the range 240-300 ng g(-1), lipid base, for subjects in the 27-54 year age groups. A raise in NDL-PCB body burden (430-470 ng g(-1), lipid base) was observed for the two 55+ year age groups, in agreement with the expected age-dependent increase. The findings from this study do not show an incremental exposure to PCDDs and PCDFs in the samples from subjects living around the two incineration plants, whereas PCB congener profiles in all samples suggest a possible impact on the area of interest of industrial activities from near industrial settlements.
17110171	Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) were exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture (Aroclor 1254) or one of three individual congeners (planar PCB 77 or ortho-substituted PCB 47 and PCB 153) in the diet for 30 days to investigate the effects of PCBs on circulating thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Aroclor 1254 (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg body mass/day) decreased plasma T3 levels consistently, but the effects on T4 levels were inconsistent from year to year. Exposure to PCB 153 (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg body mass/day) significantly lowered both T4 and T3, while PCB 47 at the same doses had no effect on thyroid hormone levels. The lower doses of PCB 77 (0.004, 0.01 and 0.02 mg/kg body mass/day) had no effect on T4 or T3, whereas the highest dose (0.1 mg/kg body mass/day) increased T4 levels significantly. The results of the present study demonstrate that exposure to PCBs at environmentally realistic concentrations can have profound effects on the thyroid status of Atlantic croaker. The ortho-substituted PCB 153 appears to contribute at least partially to the deleterious effects of Aroclor 1254 on thyroid status, whereas the planar PCB 77 at concentrations present in the mixture is unlikely to alter thyroid hormone levels.
22104335	Human exposure to PCBs is nearly universal in North America. While most exposure can be linked to consumption of contaminated fish, detection of PCBs in non-fish eating populations suggests that other routes of exposure including inhalation of PCB-laden particles or volatile congeners, ingestion of contaminated soil or dust, or dermal absorption following direct contact are also important. In an effort to assess the role of the residential environment as a source of exposure, vacuum dust was collected from the homes of 26 Wisconsin residents whose serum PCB levels had been measured approximately 2 years earlier. More than 60 congeners were detected in dust with all of the samples containing congeners 101, 110, 138 and 153. Total PCB levels ranged from 8.8 to 1186 ng g(-1) with levels being highest in vacuum dust from homes built between 1959 and 1970. Total PCB levels ranged from 0.05 to 8.34 μg L(-1) in serum collected from the adults living in these households, with congeners 138, 153 and 180 predominating. Hexa- and hepta-chlorinated biphenyls comprised 73% of the total residues detected in serum. However, most of the residues found in dust were lower chlorinated congeners with tetra- and penta-chlorinated biphenyls being dominant. Following log transformation, a positive association was found between serum and house dust PCB levels. This association was stronger among infrequent consumers of Great Lake fish, but of borderline statistical significance. This exploratory study suggests that house dust may be a significant source of exposure to PCBs and supports the need for further investigations.
21873374	Developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes hearing loss that may be due to reduced thyroxine during cochlear development. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are structurally similar to PCBs and reduce thyroxine. This study utilized an environmental PCB mixture and a commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, that represents the PBDEs found in humans to assess the potential for additive effects of PCBs and PBDEs on cochlear function. Female Long-Evans rats were dosed with corn oil vehicle, PCBs (3 or 6 mg/kg), molar equivalent doses of PBDEs (5.7 or 11.4 mg/kg), 3 mg/kg PCBs + 5.7 mg/kg PBDEs, or 6 mg/kg PCBs + 11.4 mg/kg PBDEs throughout gestation and lactation. At weaning, pup blood was taken to assess thyroxine concentrations. One male and one female from each litter were maintained until adulthood for distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements of cochlear function. DPOAE amplitudes were decreased and thresholds were elevated in the 6 mg/kg PCB group. Exposure to PBDEs did not cause DPOAE deficits. There was an interactive effect from combined exposure such that the individual low doses of PCBs and PBDEs did not result in DPOAE deficits, but the two combined produced a deficit similar to that in the high-dose PCB group. Serum thyroxine concentrations of all groups were reduced compared with controls, but PBDEs produced a less dramatic reduction than PCBs, which could explain the lack of DPOAE effects. Importantly, there was evidence that the co-exposure to subthreshold doses of PCBs and PBDEs can have an additive effect on cochlear function.
15687046	Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), the major metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), are stable lipophilic compounds widely found in the environment and in the general population. They can enter the food chain, and their negative impact on male reproduction is currently under active scrutiny. To explore the hypothesis that environmental exposure to these compounds is associated with altered sperm chromatin structure integrity in human sperm, we conducted a study of 176 Swedish fishermen (with low and high consumption of fatty fish, a very important exposure source of POPs). We determined serum levels of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) and p,p'-DDE, and we used the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) to assess sperm DNA/chromatin integrity. When CB-153 serum levels (individual dose range, 39-1,460 ng/g lipid) were categorized into equally sized quintiles, we found an association with the DNA fragmentation index (%DFI). A significantly lower %DFI was found in the lowest CB-153 quintile (< 113 ng/g lipid) compared with the other quintiles; there was a similar tendency, although not statistically significant, between %DFI and p,p'-DDE. These results suggest that POP exposure may have a slight negative impact on human sperm chromatin integrity.
23830433	Instrumental methods based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been developed and compared using two different MS ionisation modes, electron impact (EI) and electron capture negative ionisation (ECNI), for the fast, quantitative and simultaneous determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their main metabolites (hydroxylated PCBs, OH-PCBs, and methyl sulfone PCBs, MeSO2-PCBs). Parameters affecting chromatographic separation and MS detection were evaluated in order to achieve the highest selectivity and sensitivity for both operation modes. The analytical characteristics of the developed methods were studied and compared in terms of linear range, limits of detection (LODs), limits of quantification (LOQs), and instrumental precision (repeatability and intermediate precision). Both ionisation methods showed similar precision, being relative standard deviations (RSD, %) lower than 9% and 14% for repeatability and intermediate precision, respectively. However, better LODs (from 0.01 to 0.14 pg injected for the three families of congeners studied) were achieved using ECNI-MS as ionisation mode. The suitability of the developed method was demonstrated through their application to fish liver oil samples.
9828310	Partitioning of dioxins, dibenzofurans and the dioxin-like coplanar PCBs was determined by congener-specific high resolution gc-ms analysis of compounds in 6 tissue samples each from 5 women. Samples were whole blood obtained prior to delivery; maternal adipose tissue, cord blood and placenta obtained during cesarean section delivery; and whole blood and milk taken at the time of first obstetrical follow-up examination, one to two months following delivery. All women lived in upstate New York. Specimens were collected in late 1995 and early 1996. Mean measured levels of total PCDDs, PCDFs and coplanar PCBs were 352 pg/g for adipose tissue, 526 pg/g for predelivery blood, 182 pg/g for placenta, 165 pg/g for cord blood, 352 pg/g for postpartum blood and 220 pg/g for milk. Mean total TEQ levels were 11.6 pg/g TEQ for adipose tissue, 12.1 pg/g TEQ for predelivery blood, 10.5 pg/g TEQ for placenta, 5.8 pg/g TEQ for cord blood, 10.0 pg/g TEQ for postpartum blood and 10.2 pg/g TEQ for milk.
1960759	A regression model estimating high-homolog polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) serum concentration on the basis of job exposure categorizations was developed. The model assumes first-order kinetics with a half-life determined empirically and uses variables that incorporate both intensity and duration of exposure over a 30-yr period. In order to compare the efficiency of these regression-based exposure estimates relative to often-used epidemiological parameters, models with dichotomized, ordinal, and continuous exposure surrogates were also investigated. Among the alternative exposure categorizations the most straightforward measure, ever versus never direct, was a particularly poor predictor of serum PCB level (r2 = .01). Nearly all of the candidate exposure measures we tried predicted serum levels poorly. The best of these after the fact was with total months employed in direct-exposure jobs (r2 = .43). None of the logical deductive models approached the predictability of the empirical model developed here (r2 = .69).
8579383	Maternal serum levels of DDE and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and their congeners were compared for 20 women who had a spontaneous preterm delivery and 20 matched women who had delivered at term at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York between October 1990 and August 1993. Since no substantial case-control differences were evident, these findings do not indicate that increased DDE or PCB levels are associated with spontaneous preterm birth.
20446689	This paper presents a comprehensive study of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and homologue profiles in human adipose tissues among residents of Southeast China. A large number of samples (n = 303) were selected for a number of PCB congeners (n = 62) which were analyzed by highly sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The total mean PCB concentrations were 27.2 microg/kg fat (n = 159) in Anhui Province and 17.2 microg/kg fat (n = 144) in Jiangsu Province. A significant correlation was observed between age and PCB levels but not found between gender and PCB levels. The relationship between the environmental contaminant levels and the PCB concentration in adipose tissue was also investigated. It was found that the higher PCB concentrations in human adipose tissue were associated with the higher environmental PCB levels in the corresponding regions. The PCB homologue profiles of the human adipose tissue in China are different from those in the world, similarly to the different PCB homologue pattern between Chinese and global soils. The concept of the urban fractionation effect in the environment may be applicable to explain the PCB homologue profiles and PCB levels in the human adipose tissues collected from different provinces in China. The data presented in this study can provide useful information on human exposures to PCBs in the general population of Southeast China.
17660003	BACKGROUND: Endocrine dysfunction related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) and/or the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) is being discussed as underlying developmental adversity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This study was done to evaluate effects related to the HPG axis. METHODS: A birth-cohort study was initiated in the year 2000. Healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited in the industrialized city of Duisburg, Germany. Dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and six indicator PCBs were measured in maternal blood during pregnancy and in maternal milk. Testosterone and estradiol levels were measured in maternal and cord serum of 104 mother-infant pairs representing a subsample with a complete data set of the total basic sample of 232 participants. Linear regression analysis was used to describe the association of PCDD/Fs or PCB in maternal blood or milk with sex steroid concentrations after adjustment for confounding. RESULTS: Median concentrations for PCDD/Fs in maternal blood fat and milk fat in terms of WHO-TEq were 15.3 and 13.1pg WHO-TEq/g, respectively, and for the sum of the indicator PCBs (#28, #52, #101, #138, #153, #180) 149 and 177ng/g. The adjusted ratio of geometric means when doubling the concentration of PCDD/Fs in maternal blood fat was 0.86, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.72-1.03 for testosterone and 0.73 (0.61-0.87) for estradiol in cord serum. Typically, testosterone reduction was more pronounced in cord serum of female and estradiol reduction in that of male babies. Reduction of hormone levels was generally more pronounced for dioxins than for indicator PCBs. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of newborn babies is influenced by prenatal exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs in a manner suggestive of AhR-mediation. The clinical relevance of this finding remains to be established, however. 
16053069	The impact of a recently closed old municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) on polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD), polychlorodibenzofuran (PCDF), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in the surrounding environment and resident serum has been studied in a small rural area of France. Studied soils and eggs from chickens foraging on these soils were sampled in the vicinity of the MSWI underthe prevailing wind stream, while comparison samples were collected outside the assumed impact zone. PCB levels observed in soils and eggs did not differ statistically from comparison sites. This confirmed the low impact of MSWI PCB emission on environmental media, compared to other well-known sources. PCDD/PCDF levels in soils and eggs were significantly higher than in comparison samples, pointing out the impact of MSWI emission on the surrounding environment. The high dioxin concentrations in eggs set aside for private consumption would increase the dioxin intake for the studied population. Blood specimens of 10 nonoccupationally exposed volunteers who had lived within a 2 km radius of the incinerator for at least 25 years have been analyzed. When adjusted for age, PCB and PCDD/F blood levels were higher than general European populations and comparable to a similarly exposed Belgian population.
15556543	The separation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners was evaluated on four capillary columns: 60 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness RTX-5MS and DB-XLB capillary columns, and 60 m x 0.18 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness DB-XLB and DB-5MS capillary columns. Based on performance, capacity, and cost, the RTX-5MS (60 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm thickness) and the DB-XLB (60 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness) were selected for the analysis of human serum extracts by using gas chromatography/electron-capture detection. In contrast to previous studies, the oven temperature program affords the separation of congeners that are not separated by using other combinations of capillary columns, most notably PBDE-47 and PCB 180. In addition, the method enables determination of OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs prevalent in a single extract of serum, which can lead to considerable time savings in the analysis of large number of samples collected for epidemiologic studies.
9548032	Adverse neurological effects of exposure to PCBs have been found up to 18 months of age. Now we report on the effect of pre- and postnatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins on the neurological condition at 42 months of age. For this purpose, PCB levels were determined in cord and maternal plasma, and used as a measure of prenatal exposure. Breast milk was analyzed for PCBs and dioxins. In addition, PCBs were determined in plasma sampled from the child at 42 months of age. We evaluated the neurological condition of 394 children using the Touwen/Hempel method. After adjustment for covariates, neither prenatal PCB exposure nor postnatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins was found to be related to the neurological condition at 42 months of age.
12100385	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Persistent organochlorine pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides, are found in the general population and tend to accumulate in blood and tissues. Their distribution was examined in the starting plasma pools for fractionation, Cohn plasma fractions and therapeutic concentrates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In each process fraction, total protein, cholesterol and triglycerides were measured as well as organochlorine pesticides and PCB congeners. RESULTS: Organochlorine compounds were undetectable in cryoprecipitate, Cohn fraction I, Factor VIII and immunoglobulin concentrates, and reduced in albumin preparations. CONCLUSION: Cohn plasma fractionation is very efficient for removing pollutants present in the starting material. Biological processing techniques should be analysed for their capacity to eliminate/reduce persistent organochlorine pollutants from the therapeutic proteins. 
19046769	A cohort of low income, city dwelling, pregnant African American Women (delivered from 1994-1999) was assembled to identify factors related to organochlorine exposure through consumption of Great Lakes resources. The cohort is known as the Great Lakes Cohort of Pregnant African American Women (GLCPAAW). Pregnant women from metropolitan Chicago, IL area clinics were administered a questionnaire on diet, demographics, and health history. Weight, height, and serum lipids were measured at delivery along with serum organochlorines such as PCBs and DDE. Congener specific concentrations of PCBs and p,p'-DDE found in the maternal serum are reported. Dominant PCB congeners found in the serum of the pregnant women at delivery included PCB 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180. The high prevalence and magnitude of PCB 101 (greater than the limit of detection in >80% of the women in the cohort) are unique characteristics of this cohort. Great Lakes fish has been identified as a source of exposure to organochlorines in several studies. Spearman correlations and robust regression models were utilized to identify the impact of Great Lakes fish ingestion on cohort serum organochlorine concentrations. Several potential confounders of the relationship between serum organochlorines and Great Lakes fish consumption were identified. Covariates related to organochlorines in correlations as well as regression models included age, body surface area, fish ingestion, lipids, parity, race and smoking. Lower chlorinated PCB congeners do not follow the same trends as the higher chlorinated congeners and DDE. The higher chlorinated PCB congeners (PCB 138, 153, and 180) and DDE were correlated with age while the lower chlorinated congeners were not. PCB 153 and 180 regression models included age as a significant covariate. None of the higher chlorinated congeners correlated to race, while both lower chlorinated congeners were correlated to race. Race was also significant in both lower chlorinated congeners' regression models. PCB 101, a lower chlorinated congener seldom found in human serum, is readily found in the cohort. Airborne PCB exposure as well as diminished metabolism of PCB 101 in African Americans may explain the increased presence of PCB 101 and it's correlation with race. High end sport fish consumers (> or =1 meal per week) carried elevated levels of DDE and higher chlorinated PCB congeners (138, 153, and 180) compared to non-sport fish eaters. Unexpectedly, DDE was correlated more consistently with fish ingestion and age (a marker of bioaccumulation) in comparison to PCBs. Small correlations were found between serum PCBs and fish ingestion (Spearman correlation=0.19 for total PCBs and fish meals per year). Additionally, Serum PCBs in low end Great Lakes sport fish consumers were not higher than non-consumers. These findings suggest the women of the cohort are being exposed to PCBs through other routes in addition to Great lakes sport fish. One major route of exposure may be Chicago air. The observed trends amongst individual PCB congeners has important ramifications because lower chlorinated congeners or their metabolites may be mediators of toxicity. Organochlorine exposure through Great Lakes fish ingestion was clearly identified in high end fish consumers while associations with race, metabolism, and possible airborne exposures pose new questions.
2547752	A gas chromatographic-electron capture detection method for determining the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as Aroclor 1254 (AR 1254) in serum was evaluated through a 2-phase collaborative study. In Phase I, each collaborator's lot of Woelm silica gel (70-150 mesh) was evaluated for elution and recovery of AR 1254, which had been added in vitro at 25 ng/mL to a serum extract. In Phase II, each collaborator analyzed a series of bovine serum samples that contained the following: (1) in vitro-spiked AR 1254; (2) in vivo AR 1254 and 8 in vitro-spiked chlorinated hydrocarbons; (3) in vivo AR 1254 only; (4) 8 in vitro-spiked chlorinated hydrocarbons only; and (5) neither AR 1254 nor chlorinated hydrocarbons above the detection limit of the method. In Phase I, the average recovery of AR 1254 from silica gel for the 6 collaborators was 87.9 +/- 15.44% (mean +/- 1 SD; N = 18; range = 52.3-105.8%). In Phase II, the analysis of in vitro spikes of AR 1254 in serum at 8.58, 16.8, 41.8, and 84.3 ppb gave mean (means) interlaboratory recoveries of 89.0, 83.3, 79.4, and 76.9%, respectively, with within-laboratory (repeatability) relative standard deviations (RSDr) of 18.8, 20.5, 10.2, and 14.1%, respectively, and among-laboratory (reproducibility) relative standard deviations (RSDR) of 21.5, 21.1, 14.6, and 20.8%, respectively. The determination of in vivo AR 1254 in samples containing approximately 10, 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL of AR 1254 resulted in interlaboratory means of 10, 22, 39, and 79 ng/mL, respectively, with RSDr = 6.7, 9.7, 6.4, and 5.8%, respectively, and RSDR = 20.6, 16.0, 10.9, and 10.3%, respectively. The precision of the method for incurred AR 1254 showed a maximum RSDr of less than 10% and a maximum RSDR of less than 21% for a concentration range of 10-100 ng/mL. The accuracy of the method as demonstrated by the mean recovery of in vitro-spiked AR 1254 over a concentration range of 8.58-843 ng/mL was 82.2%. The method has been approved interim official first action.
3104024	In late 1983, we conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study to evaluate persons at risk of exposure to three chemical waste sites by comparing clinical disease end points and clinical chemistry parameters with serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) levels. A total of 106 individuals participated in the study. The only statistically significant finding in regard to self-reported, physician-diagnosed health problems was a dose-response relationship between serum PCB levels and the occurrence of high blood pressure; however, this association failed to achieve statistical significance (p = 0.08) when we controlled for possible confounding effects of both age and smoking. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were also higher in the group with elevated serum PCBs; additionally, there were isolated statistically significant correlations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) with serum lipid fraction-adjusted PCB level (r = -0.21) and serum albumin (r = -0.24) and total bilirubin (r = 0.30) with serum PCB level. Although the ranges of serum levels reported herein from exposures to PCBs in the general environment are lower than those that have been associated with acute symptoms or illness in other studies, whether these levels are associated with long-term health risks is not known. Associations of such chronic, low-dose exposures with observable health effects as suggested by this study must be evaluated further before any final conclusions can be drawn.
18534201	Oxidative DNA damage is one of the key events thought to be involved in mutation and cancer. The present study examined the accumulation of M1dG, 3-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-pyrimido[1,2-a]-purin-10(3H)-one, DNA adducts after single dose or 1-year exposure to polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAH) in order to evaluate the potential role of oxidative DNA damage in PHAH toxicity and carcinogenicity. The effect of PHAH exposure on the number of M1dG adducts was explored initially in female mice exposed to a single dose of either 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or a PHAH mixture. This study demonstrated that a single exposure to PHAH had no significant effect on the number of M1dG adducts compared to the corn oil control group. The role of M1dG adducts in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity was further investigated in rats exposed for a year to PCB 153, PCB 126, or a mixture of the two. PCB 153, at doses up to 3000 microg/kg/day, had no significant effect on the number of M1dG adducts in liver and brain tissues from the exposed rats compared to controls. However, 1000 ng/kg/day of PCB 126 resulted in M1dG adduct accumulation in the liver. More importantly, coadministration of equal proportions of PCB 153 and PCB 126 resulted in dose-dependent increases in M1dG adduct accumulation in the liver from 300 to 1000 ng/kg/day of PCB 126 with 300-1000 microg/kg/day of PCB 153. Interestingly, the coadministration of different amounts of PCB 153 with fixed amounts of PCB 126 demonstrated more M1dG adduct accumulation with higher doses of PCB 153. These results are consistent with the results from cancer bioassays that demonstrated a synergistic effect between PCB 126 and PCB 153 on toxicity and tumor development. In summary, the results from the present study support the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage plays a key role in toxicity and carcinogenicity following long-term PCB exposure.
23027467	Whole-body polychlorinated biphenyls (ΣPCBs) and plasma hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) concentrations were determined in brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) from Wheatley Harbour, Ontario, Canada. Elevated ΣPCBs in Wheatley Harbour are suspected to have originated from industrial waste disposal and/or discharges from nearby fish processing through discarding of fish remains. Mean ΣPCB concentrations in brown bullhead from Wheatley Harbour were approximately 250 ng/g wet weight compared with approximately 40 ng/g wet weight for brown bullhead from the reference sites, Hillman Marsh and Turkey Creek (both in Ontario, Canada). A significant relationship was found between the concentrations of non-ortho and mono-ortho PCB concentrations (toxic equivalents) and liver mixed-function oxygenase in brown bullhead (r = 0.74, p < 0.001). Plasma OH-PCB concentrations were greater in Wheatley Harbour brown bullhead than in those from Hillman Marsh (3.6 vs 1.5 ng/g wet wt, p < 0.01), and were detected infrequently in those from Turkey Creek (0.1 ng/g wet wt, n = 2). The OH-PCB congeners most frequently detected were 4'-OH-CB172, 3'-OH-CB180, 4-OH-CB187, 4-OH-CB146, 3-OH-CB138, and 4-OH-CB130, which are structurally similar to the thyroid hormones. To test the hypothesis of fish waste as the cause of the observed PCB contamination of Wheatley Harbour brown bullhead, a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to compare the brown bullhead PCB congener data with equivalent data for Lake Erie walleye, Lake Erie sediment, and industrial Aroclor mixtures. The relative proportions of each Aroclor mixture were estimated using the conjugated gradient method. The high similarity between the congener signatures for Lake Erie walleye and Wheatley Harbour brown bullhead supports the hypothesis of contamination from the fish processing industry.
11673127	The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Québec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy.
21855147	The goal of the present study is to understand the probable molecular mechanism of toxicities and the associated pathways related to observed pathophysiology in high PCB-exposed populations. We have performed a microarray-based differential gene expression analysis of children (mean age 46.1 months) of Central European descent from Slovak Republic in a well-defined study cohort. The subset of children having high blood PCB concentrations (>75 percentile) were compared against their low PCB counterparts (<25 percentile), with mean lipid-adjusted PCB values of 3.02±1.3 and 0.06±0.03 ng/mg of serum lipid, for the two groups, respectively (18.1±4.4 and 0.3±0.1 ng/ml of serum). The microarray was conducted with the total RNA from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the children using an Affymetrix platform (GeneChip Human genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) and was analyzed by Gene Spring (GX 10.0). A highly significant set of 162 differentially expressed genes between high and low PCB groups (p value <0.00001) were identified and subsequently analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. The results indicate that Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Cellular Movement, Cell Signaling, Molecular Transport, and Vitamin and Mineral Metabolism were the major molecular and cellular functions associated with the differentially altered gene set in high PCB-exposed children. The differential gene expressions appeared to play a pivotal role in the development of probable diseases and disorders, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, in the PCB-exposed population. The analyses also pointed out possible organ-specific effects, e.g., cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, in high PCB-exposed subjects. A few notable genes, such as BCL2, PON1, and ITGB1, were significantly altered in our study, and the related pathway analysis explained their plausible involvement in the respective disease processes, as mentioned. Our results provided insight into understanding the associated molecular mechanisms of complex gene-environment interactions in a PCB-exposed population. Future endeavors of supervised genotyping of pathway-specific molecular epidemiological studies and population biomarker validations are already underway to reveal individual risk factors in these PCB-exposed populations.
10092427	PCB, p,p'-DDE, and mirex levels were examined in blood plasma samples of 232 anglers from Cornwall and Mississauga, Ontario, in a pilot study to establish the feasibility and suitability of using a cohort of Ontario fish license holders for large-scale health studies. Great Lakes fish, waterfowl, and ocean fish consumption were examined as predictors of contaminant levels using regression analysis, with adjustment for age, gender, and community. Levels of Great Lakes fish and waterfowl consumption and contaminant levels were generally low in comparison with those observed in other Great Lakes studies. However, even within these low levels, Great Lakes fish consumption was associated with increased blood plasma PCB levels in men and mirex levels in both men and women. Waterfowl consumption was associated with higher plasma PCB (men and women), DDE (men only), and mirex levels (men and Cornwall women), and requires further exploration. We conclude that other study designs are required (to identify high consumers) for carrying out studies of health effects associated with high levels of Great Lakes fish and waterfowl consumption.
17089110	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the CYP1A2 phenotype distribution in a population with an increased exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that would likely induce an increased activity of this enzyme. Further, to investigate the effect of sex, smoking, and oral contraceptive use on the CYP1A2 activity. METHODS: In 305 randomly selected Faroese residents aged 18-60 years, the CYP1A2 activity was determined following oral intake of a caffeine dose and subsequent determination of the urinary metabolites and calculation of the caffeine metabolic ratio (CMR). PCB exposure was assessed by measuring the serum concentration of major congeners. RESULTS: The CYP1A2 phenotype distribution was unimodal. The CMR was significantly higher both in smoking men and in smoking women, independent of oral contraceptive use, as compared with non-smokers. Among non-smokers, the CMR was significantly higher in women not using oral contraceptives than in those using oral contraceptives; a similar difference could not be established among smokers. The CMR appeared higher in men than in women, but stratified analyses confirmed a significant sex-related difference only among smokers not using oral contraceptives. Overall, the mean CMR in Faroese was significantly higher compared with the mean CMR in Danish historical controls. No association was found with PCB exposure and individual PCB congeners, except for one of three dioxin-like congeners, in confounder-adjusted multiple regression analyses. CONCLUSION: The CYP1A2 phenotype in Faroese residents was unimodally distributed and showed the inducing effect of smoking and the inhibiting effect of use of oral contraceptives, but a sex-related difference was not apparent after confounder adjustment. There was no statistically significant association between CMR and PCB exposure. 
23524270	Impact of prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on mental and motor development has been investigated in various children cohorts, but findings show temporal inconsistencies. Because a direct comparison of results obtained from different cohorts remains difficult, temporal relationship between biological PCB concentrations and long-term developmental effects is still not clearly established. The objective of this research was to use a procedure previously developed to standardize PCB biological concentration data across cohorts in order to perform a systematic analysis of temporal associations between prenatal PCB exposure and mental and motor development from neonatal period (or a young age) until school age. Prenatal exposure data from nine cohorts were standardized in terms of total PCBs per kg of lipids in maternal plasma. Systematic analysis of the "standardized biological concentration-development" relationship during follow-up of each cohort was then conducted through the application of Hill criteria. This led to retain six of the studied cohorts in the final analysis. A biological level of prenatal PCB exposure below which risk of mental or motor development should be negligible was established in the order of 1000μg/kg of lipids in maternal plasma.
16036770	The postnatal period is a critical phase of development and a time during which humans are exposed to higher levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), than during subsequent periods of life. There is a paucity of information describing effects of postnatal exposure to environmentally relevant mixtures of POPs, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE). To provide data useful for the risk assessment of postnatal exposure to POPs, mixtures containing 19 PCBs, DDT, and DDE were prepared according to their concentrations previously measured in the milk of Canadian women, and dose-response effects were tested on the proliferation of MCF7-E3 cells in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Female neonates were exposed by gavage at postnatal days (PNDs) 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 with dosages equivalent to 10, 100, and 1000 times the estimated human exposure level over the first 24 days of life. The MCF7-E3 cells showed a 227% increase in the AlamarBlue proliferation index, suggesting estrogen-like properties of the mixture, but this was not confirmed in vivo, given the absence of uterotrophic effects at PND21. An increase (511%) in hepatic ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity at the dose 100 x was the most sensitive endpoint among those measured at PND21 (organ weight, mammary gland and ovarian morphometry, hepatic enzyme inductions, serum thyroxine and pituitary hormones). In liver samples from older female rats (previously involved in a mammary tumor study [Desaulniers et al., Toxicol. Sci. 75:468-480, 2001]), hepatic metabolism of 14C-estradiol-17beta (E2) at PND55 to PND62 was significantly higher in the 1000x compared to the control group, but hepatic detoxification enzyme activities had already returned to control values. The production of hepatic 2-hydroxy-E2 decreased, whereas that of estrone increased with age. In conclusion, the smallest dose of the mixture to induce significant effects was 100x, and mixture-induced changes in the hepatic metabolism of estrogens might be a sensitive indicator of persistent effects.
9204542	Under the project of evaluating the health status of the employees of CHEMKO factory (East Slovakia) which produced PCBs between 1955 and 1985, the level of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) was measured in the serum of 242 subjects from CHEMKO (Group A) and two control groups from much less polluted areas: 1,277 females from a small mountainous village (Group B), 2,179 adults from the area of a large city of Kosice (Group C). The level of thymidine kinase (TK) was measured in the groups A and B only. In addition, age-matched groups of 155 women each from all areas were evaluated. In both the whole group and the age-matched group from CHEMKO the level of beta 2-m was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that in the respective control groups, while no difference was found in the level of TK. In conclusion, it is suggested that the decrease of beta 2-m in CHEMKO employees might be related to the immunotoxic effects of organochlorines.
7601016	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and dibenzofurans (PCDFs)) are widespread environmental contaminants which are neurotoxic in animals. Perinatal exposure to PCBs, PCDDs, and PCDFs occurs prenatally via the placenta and postnatally via breast milk. To investigate whether such an exposure affects the neonatal neurological condition, the neurological optimality of 418 Dutch newborns was evaluated with the Prechtl neurological examination. Half of the infants were breast-fed, the other half were formula-fed, representing a relatively high against a relatively low postnatally exposed group, respectively. As an index of prenatal exposure, four non-planar PCBs in cord and maternal plasma were used. These PCB levels were not related to neurological function. As measures of combined pre- and early neonatal exposure, 17 dioxin congeners, three planar, and 23 non-planar PCB congeners were determined in human milk in the second week after delivery. Higher levels of PCBs, PCDDs, and PCDFs in breast milk were related to reduced neonatal neurological optimality. Higher levels of planar PCBs in breast milk were associated with a higher incidence of hypotonia. This study confirms previous reports about the neurotoxic effects of these compounds on the developing brain of newborn infants.
15539224	Mature male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single IP injection of either 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (HCB), 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) (300 microm/kg) in corn oil (10 ml/kg) or the corn oil vehicle alone, and were killed four days later after having been fasted overnight. The vehicle control group consisted of rats which were allowed free access to feed as well as pair-fed animals. Lipid analyses were conducted on liver, hepatic microsomes and serum. TCB- (but no HCB-) treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in total liver lipids and triglycerides. Liver phospholipids remained unchanged. Both PCBs increased the cholesterol and phospholipids content of the liver microsomal fraction. Serum lipids measured were not statistically different from control values. While HCB had little effect on the fatty acid composition of liver lipids, TCB caused an increase in C 18:1 (n-9) and a decrease in C 20:4 (n-6). Both PCBs increased C 18:0 in the hepatic microsomal fraction, but TCB also decreased C 16:0. Neither PCB altered the fatty acid composition of serum total lipids. These data are consistent with the concept that specific alterations in lipid metabolism are dependent on the structure of the PCB.
21543048	The AHR pathway activates transcription of CYP1A and mediates most toxic responses from exposure to halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants such as PCBs and PCDD/Fs. Therefore, expression of CYP1A is predictive of most higher level toxic responses from these chemicals. To date, no study had developed an assay to quantify CYP1A expression in any sturgeon species. We addressed this deficiency by partially characterizing CYP1A in Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) and shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) and then used derived sturgeon sequences to develop reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays to quantify CYP1A mRNA expression in TCDD and PCB126 treated early life-stages of both species. Phylogenetic analysis of CYP1A, CYP1B, CYP1C and CYP3A deduced amino acid sequences from other fishes and sturgeons revealed that our putative Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon CYP1A sequences most closely clustered with previously derived CYP1A sequences. We then used semi-quantitative and real-time RT-PCR to measure CYP1A mRNA levels in newly hatched Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon larvae that were exposed to graded doses of waterborne PCB126 (0.01-1000 parts per billion (ppb)) and TCDD (0.001-10 ppb). We initially observed significant induction of CYP1A mRNA compared to vehicle control at the lowest doses of PCB126 and TCDD used, 0.01 ppb and 0.001 ppb, respectively. Significant induction was observed at all doses of both chemicals although lower expression was seen at the highest doses. We also compared CYP1A expression among tissues of i.p. injected shortnose sturgeon and found significant inducibility in heart, intestine, and liver, but not in blood, gill, or pectoral fin clips. For the first time, our results indicate that young life-stages of sturgeons are sensitive to AHR ligands at environmentally relevant concentrations, however, it is yet to be determined if induction of CYP1A can be used as a biomarker in environmental biomonitoring.
18285840	Ingestion has been a primary route of PCB exposure for people, especially those not working directly in industrial settings. During 2002-2004, women were recruited at delivery from two districts in eastern Slovakia: Michalovce with high PCB contamination from a chemical manufacturing plant, and Svidnik located 70 km to the northwest, having lower environmental levels of PCBs. Concentrations of 15 PCB congeners were measured in maternal serum using high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. A food frequency questionnaire was developed and validated at the Research Institute of Nutrition and School of Medicine in Bratislava, Slovakia. The questionnaire was comprised of 88 food items representative of the national dietary habits and designed to ascertain (1) the source of food items as reported by the women (locally produced or purchased from a retail outlet) and (2) quantities consumed of high-fat food categories representative of the national dietary habits. Our primary goal was to identify specific food sources, either locally produced or purchased from retail stores, that might predict serum concentrations of PCBs. We used multiple linear regression to examine the relationship of dietary fats to lipid-adjusted serum PCB levels in 948 adult women (Michalovce N=662, Svidnik N=284) who had recently given birth. We adjusted for residential district, age, body mass index, education and duration of previous lactation. Consumption of fat from locally produced foods was significantly associated with higher levels of lipid-adjusted serum PCB (beta=0.06, P=0.007). Fat from foods purchased in retail outlets showed no significant association (beta=-0.02, P=0.36). There was no interaction between district and diet in predicting serum PCB levels. Comparing women in Michalovce consuming 20 g of fat per day from local sources with those consuming 1 g of fat per day from local sources, lipid-adjusted serum concentrations were predicted to be higher by 81 ng/g lipid or 14.8% 630 ng/g lipid versus 549 ng/g lipid.
22931295	BACKGROUND: Studies have shown associations of diabetes and endogenous hormones with exposure to a wide variety of organochlorines. We have previously reported positive associations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and inverse associations of selected steroid hormones with diabetes in postmenopausal women previously employed in a capacitor manufacturing plant. METHODS: This paper examines associations of PCBs with diabetes and endogenous hormones in 63 men previously employed at the same plant who in 1996 underwent surveys of their exposure and medical history and collection of bloods and urine for measurements of PCBs, lipids, liver function, hematologic markers and endogenous hormones. RESULTS: PCB exposure was positively associated with diabetes and age and inversely associated with thyroid stimulating hormone and triiodothyronine-uptake. History of diabetes was significantly related to total PCBs and all PCB functional groupings, but not to quarters worked and job score, after control for potential confounders. None of the exposures were related to insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in non-diabetic men. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of PCBs with specific endogenous hormones differ in some respects from previous findings in postmenopausal women employed at the capacitor plant. Results from this study, however, do confirm previous reports relating PCB exposure to diabetes and suggest that these associations are not mediated by measured endogenous hormones. 
12202931	Exposure to environmental contaminants can induce physiological changes in animals through various mechanisms. One manifestation of subclinical toxicity from polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure is the disruption of normal immune function described in numerous species, including American kestrels (Falco sparverius). In 1998, 152 mature male and female kestrels were fed either a mixture of Aroclor 1248:1254:1260 (approximately 7 mg/kg kestrel/day) through their food items, or control diets. Offspring produced by 50 breeding pairs (thus, half received in ovo PCB exposure only) were also studied. Total and differential white blood cell counts, the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin response, as well as thyroid hormone levels were tested in vivo in nonbreeding adults (1998 only) and nestlings (1998 and 1999). In 1999, nestlings came from three parental groups; adults exposed in 1998, birds produced by PCB-exposed parents, and unexposed birds. In 1998, directly exposed males but not females had increased total white blood cell counts driven by lymphocytosis, plus a decreased heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio relative to controls. PCB-exposed birds had a significantly greater response to PHA than did controls, with sex as a significant factor and plasma triiodothyonine (T(3)) as a significant covariate. Levels of T(3) were significantly depressed in PCB-exposed birds of both sexes. The 1999 nestlings (F1 generation with respect to PCB exposure) did not show any effect of parental treatment group on the PHA skin response, yet T(3) remained as a significant covariate. Immunological effects are discussed in light of the antibody-mediated immunotoxicity found in the same birds and reported previously.
9134679	Inuit people residing in the Arctic are unusually exposed to organochlorines through their traditional diet which includes large quantities of sea mammal fat. Recently, 499 Inuit adults from Nunavik (Arctic Quebec) participated in a large health survey and donated a blood sample for organochlorine and heavy metal analysis. Twenty pooled plasma samples were formed, each made of individual samples from the same age group, sex, and region of residence, to allow for dioxin-like compound determination. The mean total concentration of PCBs and dioxin-like compounds (the latter expressed in 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalents) were respectively 4.1 mg/kg lipids and 184.2 ng/kg lipids, compared to 0.13 mg/kg lipids and 26.1 ng/kg lipids for three control pooled plasma samples from Southern Quebec. Total PCBs and dioxin-like compound concentrations were strongly correlated (r = 0.98; p < 0.0001), increased with age and were greater in men than in women. Although the body burdens of PCBs and dioxin-like compounds are close to those which induced adverse health effects in laboratory animals, dietary benefits from the sea-food based diet still outweigh the hypothetical health risks.
18514762	A chemical plant located in Brescia, an industrial city in North-Western Italy, produced polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) during a 30-50 year period, causing widespread pollution of the surrounding agricultural area. This area contains several small farms, which principally produce veal meat for private consumption of the farmers' families. The pollution went undiscovered for many years, during which period contaminated food was regularly consumed. This paper reports the polychlorodibenzodioxin (PCDD), polychlorodibenzofuran (PCDF) and PCB levels of a serum sample pooled from the consumers of contaminated food, compared to six population groups of the city of Brescia. Four of these groups were selected in order to represent, respectively, the local general population and the residents of three zones of the polluted area, while the last two groups represented, respectively, the present and the former workers of the plant. One human milk sample from one of the consumers of contaminated food was also analyzed. Results show that the consumers of the contaminated food and the former workers of the plant display considerably higher levels than all other groups. The levels of general population and of all other groups were generally similar both to each other and to the range of literature values for unexposed populations. The respective contribution of PCDDs, PCDFs, mono-ortho and non-ortho PCBs (dioxin-like PCBs) to (Toxicity Equivalents) TEQ of the population groups of this study were also compared to literature data: the two groups with a high contamination level, together with the human milk sample, displayed a higher incidence of mono-ortho PCBs and a lower contribution of PCDD, possibly correlated with the source of contamination.
15743714	Cytochrome P-450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is an enzyme involved in the metabolic activation of some carcinogens and is believed to be induced by xenobiotics. Very few studies, however, have investigated the association between environmental exposures and in vivo CYP1A2 activity in humans. To address this issue, a study was conducted of CYP1A2 activity among Native Americans exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the consumption of fish from the St. Lawrence River. At the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne (in New York and in Ontario and Quebec, Canada), 103 adults were interviewed, and they donated blood for serum PCB analysis and underwent the caffeine breath test (CBT), a safe and noninvasive procedure that uses caffeine as a probe for CYP1A2 activity in vivo. The results supported the findings of other studies that CBT values are higher among smokers and men and lower among women who use oral contraceptives. Despite a relatively low average total PCB body burden in this population, the sum of serum levels for nine mono- or di-ortho-substituted PCB congeners showed positive associations with CBT values (p = 0.052 wet weight and p = 0.029 lipid adjusted), as did toxic equivalent quantities (TEQs; p = 0.091 for wet weight and 0.048 for lipid adjusted). Regarding individual congeners, serum levels of PCB-153, PCB-170, and PCB-180 were significantly correlated with CBT values. The results support the notion that CYP1A2 activity may be a marker of an early biological effect of exposure to PCBs in humans and that the CBT may be a useful tool to monitor such effects.
12633733	A number of epidemiological studies have shown predictive relationships between prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and subtle deficits in cognitive development in infancy through the preschool years [Child Dev. 56 (1985) 853; J. Pediatr. 116 (1990) 38; J. Pediatr. 134 (1999) 33; Toxicol. Lett. 102-103 (1998) 423; Neurotox. 21 (6) (2000) 1029-1038]. However, since not all studies have demonstrated these relationships (J. Pediatr. 119 (1991) 58-63), debate regarding the role of prenatal PCB exposure in cognitive development continues. The current study was designed to provide additional data to assist in resolving this question. Two hundred twelve children enrolled in the Oswego Newborn and Infant Development Project were assessed using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at 38 months of age, followed by a reassessment at 54 months of age. The relationship between prenatal exposure to PCBs (cord blood PCBs) and McCarthy performance was assessed at both ages after first controlling for a wide range of important predictors of cognitive development, including socioeconomic status (SES), maternal IQ, maternal education, home environment, cigarette smoking, and many others. Cord blood PCBs were statistically significant predictors of small but measurable deficits in McCarthy performance at 38 months of age. Moreover, a significant interaction between cord blood PCBs and maternal hair mercury (MeHg) was found, such that negative associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and McCarthy performance were found in subjects with higher levels of prenatal PCB exposure. No relationship between PCBs and/or MeHg and McCarthy performance was observed when the children were reassessed almost 1.5 years later (54 months of age). Inspection of the age-related trajectory of McCarthy performance revealed that the more highly exposed children caught up with the least exposed children by 54 months. Although the current data partially replicate the findings of Jacobson et al., Patandin et al., and Walkowiak et al. [J. Pediatr. 116 (1990) 38; J. Pediatr. 134 (1999) 33; Lancet 358 (2001) 1602], results reported here suggest that functional recovery may occur. Moreover, the interaction between PCB and MeHg cannot be considered conclusive until it has been replicated in subsequent investigations.
15885742	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and related compounds such as polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) alter sexual maturation and endocrine function in animals. In 1978-1979, a mass poisoning occurred in central Taiwan from cooking oil contaminated by heat-degraded PCBs and oxidated compounds PCDFs. We tested the hypothesis that in utero exposed to PCBs/PCDFs alter sexual maturation, endocrine, and reproductive function in the human pubescent females. METHODS: In 1997-1999, girls aged 13-19 years, born to mothers exposed to PCBs/PCDFs, was invited to participate in the study. Menstruation characteristic was recorded daily for 84 days and serum levels of estradiol, LH, FSH, and testosterone were measured on the 3rd day of menstruation. RESULTS: A total of 17 exposed girls and controls participated, the exposed girls reported shorter mean duration of bleeding per cycle than 16 unexposed (5.5 vs 6.5 days, P=0.0055). There was a higher rate of irregular menstrual cycle in the exposed girls (40% vs 0%, P=0.018). Serum levels of estradiol (P=0.016) and FSH (P=0.061) were higher in exposed girls as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that prenatal exposure to PCBs/PCDFs resulted in abnormal menstruation and higher estradiol and FSH levels in follicular phase of menstrual cycle in adolescent girls. 
1686676	The ability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to induce chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in peripheral lymphocytes was studied in a group of workers occupationally exposed to PCBs during the production of the Czechoslovak PCB products Delor 103 and Delor 106. The effect of PCB exposure was compared between an exposed group (N = 32, 3.25 +/- 0.34% aberrant cells, AB.C.), control group 1 (N = 20, 1.30 +/- 0.29% AB.C.), and control group 2 (N = 20, 1.60 +/- 0.31% AB.C.). The length of PCB exposure over 10 yr increased the frequency of AB.C. in a group exposed for 11-15 yr to 3.40% (N = 5) and in a group exposed for 16-25 yr to 5.85% (N = 7) vs. an increase of 1.60% AB.C. in group C2 and of SCE to 12.6 +/- 0.9/cell vs. 6.9 +/- 0.7 SCE/cell in C2. The clastogenic activity observed in this group may be the result of a high PCB concentration in blood plasma (320 +/- 190 micrograms PCB/l), and it is probably related to its solubility in adipose tissue, when it may act as another mutagen and carcinogen biotransformation inducer.
11217063	To investigate the effects of intermittent and continuous exposure of lactating rats to Aroclor 1242 (a PCB congener), testis weight, daily sperm production (DSP) and Sertoli cell number per testis were examined in the adult male offspring. Thyroxine (T4) was also measured because of the well-documented effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on this hormone. In experiment 1.3 groups of lactating female rats received daily subcutaneous injections of low (0.8 mg) or high (1.6 mg) doses of Aroclor 1242 in 0.1 ml corn oil from parturition to weaning of pups at 21 days. In experiment II, 3 groups of lactating rats received 2 subcutaneous injections per week of 0.8 or 1.6 mg Aroclor 1242, as in experiment 1. In both experiments, control rats received vehicle alone. Serum T4 was measured at 21 and 90 days of age, and testis weight, DSP and Sertoli cell numbers were examined at 90 days. In experiment I (continuous exposure), both the low (0.8 mg) and high (1.6 mg) doses suppressed T4 concentrations at 21 days of age. Testis weight was increased by 14.8% (LD) and 16.5% (HD) compared with controls. DSP was increased by 20.4% in the low dose and 25% in the high dose animals compared with controls. The number of Sertoli cells per testis was increased by 32.6 and 39.4% in low and high dose animals, respectively. A similar study in which the lactating females were only dosed twice per week (experiment 11) did not show any differences in these parameters. These results indicate that continuous exposure of lactating female rats to PCBs increases testis weight, sperm production and Sertoli cell numbers in the adult male offspring.
21724230	A study was conducted to evaluate the association between PCBs in residential indoor air and in the serum of older, long time residents of three upper Hudson River communities. Samples of indoor air and of serum were collected from 170 persons 55 to 74 years of age, and analyzed for PCBs using glass capillary gas chromatography. After adjusting for age, BMI, cigarette smoking, and Hudson River fish consumption with multiple linear regression analysis, the results indicated statistically significant associations between concentrations in indoor air and serum for PCB-28, a lightly chlorinated congener common in air that accumulates in serum, and PCB-105. Duration of exposure was an important factor, since among persons who had lived in their home for 39 years or more, 11 of the 12 most commonly detected congeners were significantly correlated, as was their sum (∑ PCB). Significant associations between indoor air and serum PCB concentrations also were more likely when collected in cooler months and if the two samples were collected within 20 d of each other. The study is among the first to indicate that PCB concentrations characteristic of residential indoor air are associated with a detectable increase in body burden.
21739933	This study aimed at the generation of preliminary results allowing for the assessment of breastfed infants exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) which constitute important contaminants in places of human habitation. The second goal was to compare the concentrations of these compounds with other contaminants which people are exposed to via food chain. 28 breast milk samples from women living in Warsaw and neighbourhood were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153), polychlorinated biphenyls (CB-77, CB-101, CB-118, CB-126, CB- 138, CB-153, CB170, CB-180) and organochlorine pesticides (HCB, β-HCH, γ-HCH, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDT). The ΣDDT levels noted in our studies were higher than in other European countries. The concentrations of the examined polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers did not diverge from the levels presented by other authors and are comparable to the levels noted in other countries in Europe.
17764717	The aim of the present study was to understand the placental transfer of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), specific hydroxylated PCB metabolites (OH-PCBs), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) in blood serum, in a birth cohort from eastern Slovakia. During the period 2002-2004, cord blood specimens were collected in parallel with maternal specimens from women delivering in the two eastern Slovak districts of Michalovce and Svidnik/Stropkov. A total of 92 pairs of mother-cord specimens at delivery were selected for this study. 4-OH-CB107, 3-OH-CB153, 4-OH-CB146, 3'-OH-CB138, 4-OH-CB187, and 4'-OH-CB172 were quantified. The median concentrations of Sigma(17)PCBs, Sigma(6)OH-PCBs, and PCP in cord serum were 0.92, 0.33, and 0.69 ng/g wet wt., respectively and highly correlated with the corresponding maternal serum levels (correlations were R(2)=0.61, 0.78, and 0.82, respectively). The median cord to mother ratios of the Sigma(17)PCBs, Sigma(6)OH-PCBs, and PCP were 0.18, 0.75, and 1.10, respectively. The median ratio of the Sigma(6)OH-PCBs to the Sigma(17) PCBs in the cord serum was 0.38 from wet weight based concentrations, which was about four times higher than the ratio of these compounds in maternal serum (0.09). PCP was more abundant than any PCB or OH-PCB congener measured in cord serum. The higher cord to maternal ratios of OH-PCB metabolites as compared with the parent compounds suggests either a higher placental transfer rate or greater metabolism in the fetus as compared with the maternal compartment. These findings are consistent with their preferential binding to TTR that can cross the placenta. The cord to maternal ratio varies by congener (e.g., 4-OH-CB107=0.58, 4-OH-CB146=0.74, 3'-OH-CB138=1.01).
6772747	Effects of dietary level of protein on liver microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme system, lipids and urinary ascorbic acid metabolism were studied in the rats fed 0.1% polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing diets. In the rats not receiving PCB, the activity of the enzyme system increased as the protein level was increased up to around 35%. In a short-term experiment (8-9 days), dietary PCB caused an increase in the activity of the enzyme system regardless of dietary level of protein. In a semi-long term experiment (29-30 days), however, 35-55% protein diets did not allow for induction to the same extent. As a result the highest activity was observed with 10-20% protein diets in this period. The increments in urinary ascorbic acid and in serum cholesterol were generally potentiated with high-protein diets. Maximum increments in urinary ascorbic acid and serum cholesterol were obtained with 20% protein and 35% protein, respectively, in the semi-long term experiment. In contrast to serum cholesterol, the accumulation of liver cholesterol and triglyceride due to PCB was markedly potentiated with low-protein diets.
21888873	Blood (plasma/serum) samples from 14 adult female and their pups (1-4 days old) captured in the West Ice, east of Greenland were analysed for concentrations of total and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine (TT4, FT4, TT3, FT3), and hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs). The levels of all thyroid hormones (THs) were significantly higher in pups than in mothers. Sum OH-PCB levels (ΣOH-PCBs: 4-OH-CB107, 3'-OH-CB138, 4-OH-CB146, 4'-OH-CB172, 4-OH-CB187) were significantly higher in mothers (3.98 ± 1.55 pmol/g; 1.40 ± 0.54 ng/g wet weight) as compared to pups (1.95 ± 0.78 pmol/g; 0.68 ± 0.28 ng/g wet weight). Plasma levels of TT4 and FT4 in mothers increased as a function of pup age, as did levels of individual OH-PCBs in both mothers and pups. The pattern of OH-PCBs in the pups was similar to their mothers. We suggest that OH-PCBs found in pups are transferred from their mothers during gestation and that the transfer also continues after parturition via milk. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that in pups, 4-OH-CB107 and 3'-OH-CB138 were negatively associated with FT4:FT3 and TT3:FT3 ratios, respectively. These relationships were confirmed by partial correlation analysis correcting for pup age. PCA suggested that 4'-OH-CB172 and 4-OH-CB187 were negatively associated with TT3 in mothers. However, this was not confirmed by correlation tests. Although statistical relationships should be interpreted with caution, the study indicates that young developing seals are more sensitive compared to adults with respect to TH-related effects of OH-PCBs.
9404319	OBJECTIVES: To assess whether excess mortality from cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin, and cancers of the brain and liver in particular, is associated with long term occupational exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). METHODS: An epidemiological study of mortality was conducted among 138,905 men employed for at least six months between 1950 and 1986 at five electrical power companies in the United States. Exposures were assessed by panels composed of workers, hygienists, and managers at each company, who considered tasks performed by workers in 28 job categories and estimated weekly exposures in hours for each job. Poisson regression was used to examine mortality in relation to exposure to electrical insulating fluids containing PCBs, controlling for demographic and occupational factors. RESULTS: Neither all cause nor total cancer mortality was related to cumulative exposure to PCB insulating fluids. Mortality from malignant melanoma increased with exposure; rate ratios (RRs) relative to unexposed men for melanoma were 1.23 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.56 to 2.52), 1.71 (0.68 to 4.28) and 1.93 (0.52 to 7.14) for men with < 2000, > 2000-10,000, and > 10,000 hours of cumulative exposure to PCB insulating fluids, respectively, without consideration of latency. Lagging exposure by 20 years yielded RRs of 1.29 (0.76 to 2.18), 2.56 (1.09 to 5.97), and 4.81 (1.49 to 15.50) for the same exposure levels. Mortality from brain cancer was modestly increased among men with < 2000 hours (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.01) and > 2000-10,000 hours exposure (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.95), but there were no deaths from brain cancer among the most highly exposed men. A lag of five years yielded slightly increased RRs. Mortality from liver cancer was not associated with exposure to PCB insulating fluids. CONCLUSIONS: This study was larger and provided more detailed information on exposure than past investigations of workers exposed to PCBs. The results suggest that PCBs cause cancer, with malignant melanoma being of particular concern in this industry. 
12865050	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to affect retinol (vitamin A) homeostasis in adult as well as neonatal seals. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between plasma (PL)-retinol status and PCB concentrations in different blood compartments (blood cells (BCs), PL, and whole blood (WB)) of free-ranging neonatal gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) and to identify which PCB congeners may be responsible for the PL-retinol-depressing effects of PCBs. PL-retinol concentrations correlated positively with body mass and negatively with sigmaPCB (lipid-weight basis, lw) in WB and sigmaPCBlw in BCs. SigmaPCBlw in WB was the parameter that best described the variation in PL-retinol concentration (r2=0.455, n=20, P=0.0007). Furthermore, PL-retinol concentrations correlated with nine of the 15 detected PCB congeners. It is possible that there is an equilibration between the concentrations of metabolizable congeners and their metabolites and that the retinol-depressing effect of PCBs in neonatal gray seals is caused by PCB-OH metabolites that interfere with the formation of PL transport complexes that transport retinol in PL and increase renal excretion of retinol. This suggestion is in accordance with previous mechanistic explanations of the retinol-depressing effect of PCB in rodents.
15325879	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may affect the female reproductive system in both animals and humans. In Sweden, a main exposure source to PCBs is consumption of fatty fish from the Baltic Sea. From 165 female consumers of such fish (fishermen's sisters), information on time to pregnancy (TTP) and miscarriages was collected, blood was drawn, and serum was analyzed for 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), a biomarker for total PCB exposure. TTP and miscarriage data, as well as plasma CB-153 concentrations, for 121 fishermen's wives were available from previous studies. Thus, information on 286 women was available for investigation of whether a high exposure to PCB affects fertility negatively by increasing the TTP. The concentrations of CB-153 at the time of conception were estimated and trichotomized into low, medium, and high exposure groups. When we analyzed the joint data set of fishermen's wives and fishermen's sisters, a decrease rather than an increase in TTP was indicated for women in the medium (fecundability ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 0.89-1.82]) and high (fecundability ratio 1.42 [0.99-2.03]) exposure groups compared to those in the low exposure group. Similar results were found when we stratified on the original data set (fishermen's wives and fishermen's sisters) or childhood exposure. Women with miscarriages had lower estimated past CB-153 concentrations than women with live births. Our data provide no evidence of a hazardous effect associated with CB-153 concentration in the exposure range assessed. The exposure levels found in the fishermen's families, although high compared to that in the general Swedish population, may not be high enough to negatively affect fertility.
18560538	BACKGROUND: It is well documented that acute exposure to high levels of persistent organic pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorophenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), can affect human health including thyroid function. Chronic exposure to multiple toxicants is common but difficult to analyze, and most prior studies have focused on adults or newborns, creating a gap in our understanding of multitoxicant effects among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether levels of PCBs, p,p'-DDE, HCB, mirex, lead, and mercury reflecting past chronic exposure are associated with alterations in levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T(3)), total thyroxine (TT(4)), and free thyroxine (FT(4)) among older children and adolescents. METHODS: The sample consists of youth from the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation (n=232) who reside in proximity to several industries that have contaminated the local environment. We used multiple regression analysis to examine the effect of PCB groupings, p,p'-DDE, HCB, lead, and mercury on thyroid hormones after adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and controlling for all other toxicants. RESULTS: Exposure to PCBs affects the thyroid hormone profile in adolescents. The group of persistent PCBs was positively associated with TSH but inversely related to FT(4). Nonpersistent PCBs were significantly and negatively related to FT(4) only. HCB was negatively associated with T(4), and lead was positively associated with T(3). Breast-fed adolescents had higher levels of persistent PCBs and p,p'-DDE but not of nonpersistent PCBs or any other toxicant when compared with non-breast-fed adolescents. Though having lower levels of persistent PCBs and p,p'-DDE, non-breast-fed adolescents exhibited significant relationships between persistent PCBs and TSH and FT(4), but breast-fed adolescents did not. It appears that PCBs from breast milk obscure the relationship between prenatal PCB exposure and thyroid function by adding random variation in PCB levels. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a reduction in thyroid function in adolescents in relation to their current serum levels of PCBs. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that pre-natal exposure to PCBs alters thyroid function in a long-lasting manner but does not exclude the possibility that postnatal exposure is influential also. 
18396099	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been in widespread industrial use in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite a worldwide reduction, environmental exposure remains an issue especially in contaminated buildings. Due to the ubiquitous presence and poor degradation of PCBs, public health concerns continue to exist; however, evidence on the actual health effects of chronic low-dose exposure is scanty. The objective of the present study is an assessment of subjective complaints of exposed subjects in comparison to a non-exposed control group and their inter-relation to plasma levels of PCB congeners. The plasma concentrations of PCB congeners were measured in 583 subjects who had worked for an average of 14.7+/-9.6 years in a contaminated building in Germany, and 205 control subjects working in a non-contaminated building. Subjective complaints were assessed with the 24-item 'Giessen Subjective Complaints List' (GSCL-24). The subjects under chronic low-dose exposure scored significantly higher values on all the GSCL subscales except 'stomach complaints' in comparison to the non-exposed subjects and a 'normal' sample derived from the literature. However, thorough statistical analysis revealed no correlation of symptoms and PCB congener plasma concentration; the scores on the subscale 'exhaustion were even higher in subjects with low PCB concentration. Subjects working in a PCB-contaminated building report more subjective complaints in comparison to non-exposed subjects, but the complaints are not related to current PCB plasma concentrations.
17764566	BACKGROUND: The presence of PCB in caulking (sealant) material found in masonry buildings has been well-documented in several countries. A recent investigation of 24 buildings in the greater Boston area found that 8 buildings had high PCB levels in caulking materials used around window frames and in joints between masonry blocks. Workers removing caulking material have been shown to have elevated serum PCB levels. METHODS: This project compared serum PCB levels among male workers who installed and/or removed PCB-containing caulking material from buildings in the greater Boston area with reference serum PCB levels from 358 men from the same area. Serum PCB levels were measured in the same laboratory by liquid-liquid extraction, column chromatography clean-up and dual capillary column GC/microECD analysis. RESULTS: When the congener profiles were compared between the reference population and the construction workers, the serum levels of the more volatile, lighter PCBs (di-, tri-and tetrachloro, sum of IUPAC# 6-74) were substantially higher among the construction workers. One of the youngest workers had the lowest total serum PCB levels (sum of 57 congeners) of all 6 workers, but the contribution of more volatile (less chlorinated) PCB congeners (#16, 26,28,33,74,66, and 60) was markedly higher than in other 5 workers and reference men. Only this worker was working on a job that involved removing PCB caulking at the time of the blood sampling. CONCLUSION: While the results of this pilot study are based upon small numbers (6 construction workers who handled PCB caulking), the serum PCB levels among the construction workers exceed the referents. Comparison of the congener profiles suggests that there are substantial differences between the construction workers and the general population samples. These differences, and the similarities of profiles among the construction workers strongly suggest that occupational contact with caulking material can be a major source of PCB exposure for construction workers. 
10092423	A study was conducted to assess local fish consumption patterns and their relationship to concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the serum of Mohawk men residing near three hazardous waste sites. From 1992 to 1995, 139 men were interviewed and donated a 20-ml venous blood sample. The results indicated that the men ate a mean of 21.2 local fish meals during the past year, compared with annual means of 27.7 meals 1-2 years before and 88.6 meals more than 2 years before (P<0.001 for test of trend). This change is probably a consequence of advisories issued against the consumption of local fish, since 97% of the men were aware of the advisories and two-thirds had changed their behavior as a result. Multiple regression analysis revealed that serum PCB levels increased with age (beta=0.036, P<0.001) and local fish consumption (beta=0.088, P=0.006). The data suggest that local fish consumption has contributed to body burdens in this population and that the advisories have been effective in modifying local fish consumption habits.
9194421	Hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OHCBs) have been identified in blood of marine mammals, fish-eating birds, and humans at concentrations in some cases exceeding those of the unmetabolized polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). OHCBs have been associated with inhibition of vitamin A and thyroxin transport, estrogenicity in a mouse uterotrophic assay, and feminization of male turtle sexual development. OHCBs, representing both environmentally derived and laboratory exposure-derived metabolites, were tested in an in vitro bioassay utilizing an estrogen-responsive human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF7-LUC) stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene linked to estrogen responsive elements. OHCB activity was tested at three different media concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (E2), comparing the concentration-response curves using charcoal-stripped medium (0.0009 nM E2), and two physiologically relevant E2 concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 nM E2). Eleven of 13 OHCBs tested were anti-estrogenic. Evidence for an estrogen receptor mediated mechanism of action was apparent for only two OHCBs-4-OH-2',3,3',4',5,5'-Cl6-biphenyl and 4,4'-(OH)2-3,3',5,5'-Cl4-biphenyl. These two have not been identified in environmental samples. The remaining OHCBs exhibited "anti-estrogenicity" that was related to their effect on cell viability and, therefore, cannot be described as exhibiting "hormone disruption" solely by an estrogen receptor mediated mechanism. OHCB anti-estrogenic activity was eliminated in the presence of E2 concentrations normally found in humans, except for 4,4'(OH)2-3,3',5,5'-Cl4-biphenyl. 4-OH-2',3',4',5'-Cl4-biphenyl and 4-OH-2',4',6'-Cl3-biphenyl were partial estrogen agonists, exhibiting weak estrogenicity in the presence of 0.0009 nM E2 and weak anti-estrogenicity in the presence of 0.1 and 1 nM E2. Human metabolites of PCBs were not estrogenic in MCF7 cells.
18941581	BACKGROUND: Developing infants may be especially sensitive to hormone disruption from chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). OBJECTIVE: We investigated relationships between cord serum levels of PCBs and PBDEs and thyroid hormones measured in cord blood serum and neonatal blood spots. METHODS: We measured PCBs and PBDEs, thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4) and free T4 (FT4) in cord blood serum from 297 infants who were delivered at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 2004-2005. We abstracted results of total T4 (TT4) measured in blood spots collected in the hospital and at neonatal visits. We used delivery mode (augmented vaginal deliveries and nonelective cesarean deliveries) as a surrogate for intrapartum stress, which is known to alter cord blood thyroid hormones. RESULTS: In the full study population, no compounds were associated with a change in average TSH, FT4, or TT4. BDE-100 was associated with increased odds of low cord TT4, BDE-153 with increased odds of low cord TT4 and FT4, and no compounds were associated with increased odds of high TSH. For infants born by spontaneous, vaginal, unassisted deliveries, PCBs were associated with lower cord TT4 and FT4 and lower TT4 measured in neonatal blood spots. PBDEs showed consistent but mainly nonsignificant negative associations with TT4 and FT4 measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal PCB and PBDE exposures were associated with reduced TT4 and FT4 levels among infants born by spontaneous, unassisted vaginal delivery. Intrapartum stress associated with delivery mode may mask hormonal effects of PCBs and PBDEs. 
15688132	Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) of whole blood samples taken from 24 healthy adult Japanese volunteers (12 males and 12 females; age range 25-46 years). On average, 95 PCB congeners were detected in whole blood samples. The mean of total PCB concentration in whole blood was 771.9 pg g(-1) whole blood (139.6 ng per g-lipid). Congener-specific analysis identified the predominant PCB congeners as #153 (22.2%), #180 (11.6%), #138 (8.4%), #182/187 (6.6%), #118 (5.6%), #163/164 (5.0%), #99 (3.9%), #74 (3.6%), #146 (3.3%), #170 (3.0%) and #156 (2.2%), representing 75.6% of all PCBs detected in the human blood samples. Among the predominant PCB congeners, #153, #180, #138, #187 #118, #99 and #74 had chlorine as the substituent at the 2-, 4- and 5- positions of the phenyl-ring. In human blood in Japanese individuals, it is assumed that these congeners would be characteristic of the entire population, based on the relation between PCB ingestion and metabolism. Measuring 209 PCB congeners has the advantage of providing detailed information regarding the congener distribution within the blood samples, which can be compared to congener patterns in other matrices. Congener-specific analysis of 209 PCB congeners is especially useful in evaluating human exposure to PCBs.
16675436	Several studies have shown that prenatal and/or postnatal background-level exposure to environmental chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, induces adverse effects on the neurodevelopment of children. However, other studies have not detected any harmful influences on neurodevelopment. Furthermore, except in western countries, no developmental tests have been carried out in relation to detailed assessment of exposure to PCBs and dioxins. In this study (the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health), the effect of prenatal exposure to background levels of PCBs and dioxins on infant neurodevelopment in Japan/Sapporo was elucidated. The associations between the total or individual isomer level of PCBs and dioxins in 134 Japanese pregnant women's peripheral blood and the mental or motor development of their 6-month-old infants were evaluated using the second edition of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The mean level of total toxicity equivalency quantity (TEQ) was 18.8 (4.0-51.2) pg/g lipid in blood of 134 mothers. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, the total TEQ value was shown not to be significantly associated with mental developmental index (MDI) or psychomotor developmental index (PDI). However, the levels of one polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) isomer, total PCDDs, and total PCDDs/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were significantly negatively associated with MDI, and the levels of two PCDD isomers and three PCDF isomers were significantly negatively associated with the PDI. In conclusion, the background-level exposure of several isomers of dioxins during the prenatal period probably affects the motor development of 6-month-old infants more than it does their mental development.
12558174	An investigation involving raccoons (Procyon lotor) as a sentinel species at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Western Kentucky (USA) delineated the extent of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PCB spatial distribution. Raccoon exposure to PCBs was demonstrated through analysis of subcutaneous fat, abdominal fat, liver, and brain tissues from raccoons collected at the PGDP but also was clearly evident in raccoons from a reference area situated along the Ohio River (USA). Raccoons with the highest tissue PCB concentrations appeared to be those inhabiting areas nearest the plant itself and most likely those that ventured into the plants interior. Male raccoons at the PGDP had similar concentrations of total PCBs in subcutaneous fat (1.86 +/- 0.64 microg/g) as males from the reference site (1.41 +/- 0.35 microg/g), but females had higher PCB body burdens than those at the reference site (9.90 +/- 6.13 microg/g vs 0.75 +/- 0.40 microg/g). Gross measurements of exposure to radiation-producing materials revealed that counts per minute exceeded background in 61% of PGDP raccoons compared with 27% at the reference site and five raccoons at the PGDP had beta counts that were more than twice the background. Differences among trapping success, growth rates, and serum chemistry parameters were noted but may have been related to habitat and other environmental and population density factors.
8507107	The pharmacokinetics of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in humans was studied by monitoring the blood concentrations of individuals who ingested a contaminated rice oil in Japan (yusho) in 1968 and in Taiwan (yu-cheng) in 1979. Sixteen yusho patients were followed from 1982 to 1990 and three yu-cheng individuals from 1980 to 1989. From the three yu-cheng patients, blood lipid values for the two persistent toxic congeners, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PnCDF) and 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF), varied from 50 micrograms/kg at first sampling to about 1 micrograms/kg at last sampling corresponding to half-lives for elimination (t1/2) of 2-21/2 years. The blood lipid values for the same PCDF congeners in yusho patients varied from 5 micrograms/kg down to 0.1 micrograms/kg. The calculated t1/2 were more variable with median values closer to 10 years. Planar PCBs #126 and #169 were present at lower concentrations than the PCDFs. For seven of the other PCB congeners, half-lives for elimination in the yu-cheng individuals varied from 1.2 up to 4.6 yr depending on the degree of chlorination. For the yusho patients, the elimination for the PCBs was longer. These results show that clearance of the toxic PCDFs and PCBs in humans is non-linear with faster elimination at higher exposure followed by slower decreases as background levels are approached. Such a clearance pattern can best be explained by a two compartment liver and fat pharmacokinetic model.
18077114	Although human populations are continuously exposed to complex mixtures of contaminants, the effects of such exposure on the developing brain transcriptome are poorly characterized. Rats were exposed perinatally to the northern contaminant mixture (NCM) which was designed to reflect the blood contaminant profile of Canadian arctic populations, to components of the NCM administered separately (methylmercury (MeHg), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCs)) or to the goitrogen propylthiouracyl. Post-natal day (PND) 14 cerebellum global gene expression resulting from such exposures was investigated using high-density cDNA microarrays. Fifty known genes were identified as differentially expressed between the control group and at least one other treatment group. The microarray data were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) on a subset of 10 genes. The differentially expressed genes are involved in a variety of processes, including nerve cell differentiation, migration, myelination and synaptic transmission. The comparison of cerebellum gene expression profiles resulting from exposure to the NCM and its individual components in male and female pups revealed that (i) gender is a crucial biological variable influencing genomic response to environmental contaminants and (ii) contaminant co-exposure significantly masks the effects of individual mixture components on cerebellum gene expression.
16808919	We report on the use of a state-of-the-art method for the measurement of selected polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls in human serum specimens. The sample preparation procedure is based on manual small size solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by automated clean-up and fractionation using multi-sorbent liquid chromatography columns. SPE cartridges and all clean-up columns are disposable. Samples are processed in batches of 20 units, including one blank control (BC) sample and one quality control (QC) sample. The analytical measurement is performed using gas chromatography coupled to isotope dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. The sample throughput corresponds to one series of 20 samples per day, from sample reception to data quality cross-check and reporting, once the procedure has been started and series of samples keep being produced. Four analysts are required to ensure proper performances of the procedure. The entire procedure has been validated under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17025 criteria and further tested over more than 1500 unknown samples during various epidemiological studies. The method is further discussed in terms of reproducibility, efficiency and long-term stability regarding the 35 target analytes. Data related to quality control and limit of quantification (LOQ) calculations are also presented and discussed.
20378105	BACKGROUND: Extensive experimental data in animals indicate that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) during pregnancy leads to changes in offspring immune function during the postnatal period. Whether developmental PCB exposure influences immunologic development in humans has received little study. METHODS: The study population was 384 mother-infant pairs recruited from two districts of eastern Slovakia for whom prospectively collected maternal, cord, and 6-month infant blood specimens were available. Several PCB congeners were measured in maternal, cord, and 6-month infant sera by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Concentrations of IgG-specific anti-haemophilus influenzae type b, tetanus toxoid, and diphtheria toxoid were assayed in 6-month infant sera using ELISA methods. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the relation between maternal, cord, and 6-month infant PCB concentrations and the antibody concentrations evaluated at 6-months of age. RESULTS: Overall, there was little evidence of an association between infant antibody concentrations and PCB measures during the pre- and early postnatal period. In addition, our results did not show specificity in terms of associations limited to a particular developmental period (e.g. pre- vs. postnatal), a particular antibody, or a particular PCB congener. CONCLUSIONS: At the PCB concentrations measured in this cohort, which are high relative to most human populations today, we did not detect an association between maternal or early postnatal PCB exposure and specific antibody responses at 6-months of age. 
22880488	BACKGROUND: The Seveso accident (Italy) in 1976 caused the contamination of a large population by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (2,3, 7,8-TCDD). The contaminated territory was divided into three zones: A (very high contamination), B (high contamination), and R (low contamination). We report here the plasma concentrations of seven polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs), 10 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), four non-ortho-polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs (nPCBs), and Toxic Equivalencies (TEQs) in a sample of residents in the most polluted zones A and B and in a reference non-contaminated zone. METHODS: From December 1992 to March 1994, 62 individuals were randomly selected from the population living in zone A (No. =7) and B (No. =55). A sample of 59 subjects living in a surrounding non-contaminated area (non-ABR), frequency-matched by gender, age, and smoking history, was used as reference. All subjects were administered a questionnaire surveying demographic, lifestyle, medical history, and accident-related factors. We assayed plasma PCDD, PCDF, and nPCB concentrations by high-resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometric (HRGC/HRMS) analysis, with results reported as pg/g of lipid, or parts per trillion (ppt). We calculated TEQs using the WHO 2005 Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs). RESULTS: We found elevated median levels of 2,3, 7,8-TCDD in plasma samples of subjects living in zone A (73.3 ppt) and zone B (12.4 ppt), compared with residents in the reference zone (5.5 ppt). In analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, and body mass index (BMI), none of the other congeners showed levels higher than reference in the contaminated zones. Compared with men, women showed higher levels (113%) of 2,3, 7,8-TCDD and a slight elevation (17%) of TEQ for the other congeners. Age was strongly positively associated with most congener levels; TEQs for PCDDs, PCDFs, and nPCBs showed respectively 12%, 24%, and 41% increases for every 10 years of age. Current smokers had lower (from -37% to -67%) TEQ levels than subjects who had never smoked. BMI was negatively associated with levels of a few congeners, but with no impact on TEQ values. CONCLUSIONS: The Seveso accident caused a severe exposure of the population to 2,3,7,8-TCDD only. None of the other congeners analyzed showed variation across zones. Age showed a strong positive association with TEQs for all classes of compounds (PCDDs, PCDFs, and nPCBs). 
17665679	The benefits of nondestructive sampling techniques, such as plasma sampling, to directly measure contaminant exposure levels in at-risk or protected raptor populations are many. However, such assays are generally inconsistent with the most certain source of toxicity reference values, which are based on feeding studies and quantified as dietary or "in ovo" (egg-based) concentrations. An accurate conversion factor to translate nondestructive plasma-based contaminant concentrations to comparable egg-based concentrations will prove valuable to risk assessors investigating the potential effects of chemical exposures to raptors. We used databases describing the concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in great horned owls (GHO; Bubo virginianus) and total PCBs and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) from the Great Lakes region (Michigan, Wisconsin, USA) to develop a relationship to predict concentrations of PCBs and DDE in eggs. To develop a robust predictive relationship, all of the source data included concentrations of both total PCBs and/or DDE for nestling blood plasma and egg samples collected from within discrete active nesting territories and, in most instances, the same nest. The key characteristics (slope and elevation) of each relationship were tested for differences related to species and geographic region. Predicted variability of relationships were examined and compared to variability associated with natural systems. The results of statistical testing indicate that applying the conversion factors between species (GHO to bald eagle) and among geographic regions yields predicted egg concentrations that are not statistically dissimilar and are within the natural variability observed for residue concentrations among eggs of raptors within species and region.
21270998	Due to their lipophilic properties, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are commonly assessed using the blubber of marine mammals. However, these chemicals are also accumulating in other tissues including the liver. Some pollutants, namely perfluorinated alkyl acids, are found predominately in the liver and blood of marine mammals, and thus monitored in those tissues. This raises the question whether any tissue would represent an identical trend of POPs in the SLE beluga. The current study reports the first temporal trends of PBDEs and PCBs in the liver of 65 SLE belugas. Neither ∑₇PBDEs nor major individual PBDE-homolog group concentrations showed significant trends between 1993 and 2007. Also, ∑₃₂PCBs did not change over years, although, tetra-, penta- and hepta-PCB decreased by 7.1, 6.8 and 8.5%, respectively, in males, whereas tetra-, penta- and octa-PCBs declined by 11, 12 and 12.9%, respectively, in females. In order to compare the distribution of POPs between liver and blubber, a lipid normalised concentration ratio R (blubber/liver) for PBDEs and PCBs was calculated for each individual beluga. For all PBDE and several PCB homolog groups, mean R values were not statistically different from unity indicating that the partitioning of these POPs is governed by the tissue lipid-content. Temporal trends of R ratios of PBDEs and PCBs were also examined. There were generally no significant temporal trends except for PBDEs in males where R increased in average by 12.7 ± 2.9% yearly. The stratification of the blubber into a metabolically active (inner) and less active layers (outer blubber) may result in a slower response time of the blubber (full depth) than the liver to the recent change of contamination in the environment and explain the time trend differences between both tissues. This study suggests that the liver is more representative of recent exposure to lipophilic contaminants.
15222406	BACKGROUND: Increased autoantibody prevalence has been described in instances of high-dose exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In 1996, an equipment malfunction at the Swan Hills Treatment Centre in Alberta, Canada, caused the release of gases containing PCBs into the ambient air. In view of the immune effects of PCBs and their potential as endocrine disruptors, we assessed autoantibody prevalence and looked for correlations with PCB levels. METHODS: Fifty-seven persons living within a 100 km radius of the waste treatment facility were assessed. Autoantibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence, double immunodiffusion, and immunoblotting. The levels of 26 congeners of PCBs were measured by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Provincial health records for physician visits and hospitalizations were reviewed for diagnoses of autoimmune disease. RESULTS: The prevalence of autoantibodies was 11% in the study participants and 0% in healthy controls. There was no correlation of PCB levels with autoantibody results. There was no associated increase in autoimmune disease noted on physician visits or hospitalizations. PCB levels were comparable to background levels reported for other populations. CONCLUSION: A correlation of titers of autoantibodies in the sera of individuals at risk and the blood levels of PCBs was not found, and the prevalence of autoantibodies in the at-risk group was not statistically different (p > .05) from that of an unexposed control group. The study group had higher titers of autoantibodies and some strong reactivity with intracellular antigens, but the significance of this observation may be understood only after long-term clinical assessments and follow-up. 
10092422	The current study was designed to assess the pattern and concentration of prenatal PCB exposure in the newborns of women who consumed Great Lakes fish. We compared the pattern and concentration of umbilical cord blood PCBs of 145 women who reported never having consumed Great Lakes fish to 134 women who reported consuming at least 40 PCB-equivalent fish lbs of Great Lakes fish in their lifetime (Lonky et al., 1996). Although the average levels of total PCBs in cord blood were exceedingly low (approximately 1.0 ppb), the data clearly indicated that both the proportion (mol%) and the absolute concentration (ppb) of the most heavily chlorinated and persistent PCB homologues (homologues C17-C19) were markedly elevated in the cord blood of fish eaters. This effect grew markedly as a function of the total PCBs detected in the sample. Moreover, the concentration of the most heavily chlorinated PCB homologues was significantly dependent on how recently the fish were consumed relative to pregnancy. The order of highly chlorinated PCB concentration was consumed fish throughout pregnancy > consumed fish up until pregnancy > stopped consuming fish in 1984 > never consumed Lake Ontario fish. In contrast, PCB homologues of light (Cl1-Cl3) or moderate (Cl4-Cl6) chlorination were unrelated to fish consumption. Analysis of the relationship between the PCB homologues in cord blood and their homologues in breast milk provided further converging evidence of these findings. While PCB homologues of light (Cl1-Cl3) or moderate (Cl4-Cl6) chlorination did not correlate with their breast milk homologues, the most persistent and heavily chlorinated PCB homologues (Cl7-Cl9) were significantly and positively correlated with breast milk levels. These data indicate that the most heavily chlorinated PCBs provide valid and reliable exposure information in a lean medium such as cord blood. We conclude that maternal consumption of Great Lakes fish increases the risk of prenatal exposure to the most heavily chlorinated PCB homologues.
20019912	BACKGROUND: Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), unlike PCBs, are in general readily excreted yet are still detected in humans and animals. Active transport of OH-PCBs across the placenta and hydroxylation of PCBs by the fetus suggest the potential for greater impact on the fetus compared with the parent PCB compounds, but little is known about their health effects, particularly in humans. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between prenatal OH-PCB exposure and neurodevelopment in children at 16 months of age in eastern Slovakia. METHODS: A birth cohort (n = 1,134) was enrolled during 2002-2004. We analyzed six OH-PCB metabolites (4-OH-CB-107, 3-OH-CB-153, 4-OH-CB-146, 3'-OH-CB-138, 4-OH-CB-187, and 4'-OH-CB-172) in a subset of the cohort. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered to the children at the 16-month follow-up visit. We developed multiple linear regression models predicting standardized scores for the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) from maternal (n = 147) and cord (n = 80) serum OH-PCB concentrations, adjusting for sex of child, district, HOME (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment) score, and maternal score on Raven's Progressive Matrices. RESULTS: Cord 4-OH-CB-107 was significantly associated with lower MDI (beta = -2.27; p = 0.01) and PDI (beta = -4.50; p = 0.004). Also, maternal 4-OH-CB-107 was significantly associated with lower MDI (beta = -1.76; p = 0.03) but not PDI. No other OH-PCB metabolites were associated with decreased PDI or MDI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a significant association of 4-OH-CB-107 with decreased MDI, which can possibly be mediated by endocrine disruption, altered neurotransmitter functions, or reduced thyroid hormone concentrations in brain. 
10220852	3,3'4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) were administered to adult male rats in order to identify sensitive indicators of endocrine disruption. We tested the hypothesis that PCB exposure modifies follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) pituitary isoforms, as well as the pituitary and serum concentrations of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Effects on serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and testosterone (T), and prostate androgen receptor content, were also tested. In one experiment, 5 groups of 8 rats each received two i.p. injections, one day apart, of either corn oil or 6.25, 25, 100 or 400 micrograms/kg/day of PCB 126. Decreases (p < 0.05) in the serum concentrations of T4 and LH started at doses of 25 and 100 micrograms/kg/day, respectively. Serum FSH concentrations were reduced (p = 0.07) in the highest dose group. In contrast, pituitary content of FSH and LH increased with PCB-126 doses (p = 0.004, p = 0.002, respectively). Despite changes in reproductive hormones, PCB-126 had no effect on the androgen receptor content of the prostate. The effect of PCB-126 was tested in the hemicastrated rat, and suggested adverse effects on testosterone secretion. To test the effects of PCB exposure on FSH pituitary isoforms, 4 groups of 10 male rats received two i.p. injections, one day apart, of either corn oil, PCB 153 (25 mg/kg/day), estradiol-17 beta (E2; 20 micrograms/kg/day), or PCB 126 (0.1 mg/kg/day). Serum T4 levels were higher (p < 0.01) in the E2 and PCB 153 groups, and slightly reduced in the PCB 126-treated groups, compared to controls. Simultaneous purification of pituitary FSH and TSH isoforms was performed by HPLC, using two chromatofocusing columns in series. In contrast to TSH isoforms, the distribution of FSH isoforms over the chromatography run differed slightly between treatment groups; the amounts of FSH isoform eluted during the pH gradient were lower (p < 0.05) in E2 and PCB 153-treated rats than in control or PCB 126-treated rats. The similarity between the effects of E2 and PCB 153 on T4 and FSH isoforms supports the contention that PCB 153 possesses estrogenic properties. Serum LH and T4 concentrations were the most sensitive and practical endocrine indicators of PCBs 126 and 153 exposure in male rats.
17882474	Organochlorine (OC) contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) have been associated with immune modulation in wild fish-eating birds from the Great Lakes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immune function of juvenile chickens after in ovo exposure to PCB 126 or an environmentally relevant OC mixture extracted from eggs of double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) from Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA. Fertile white leghorn chicken (Gallus domesticus) eggs were injected before incubation with 0.55-1.79 ng TCDD equivalents (TEQ)/egg PCB 126 and 1.2-4.9 ng TEQs/egg of cormorant egg extract into the air cell in two separate experiments. After hatching, the immune function was tested using in vivo phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin response in 11-day-old chicks, antibody titers to immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in 28-day-old chicks, and, at necropsy, thymus and bursal mass and cellularity. PCB 126 decreased antibody titers at all doses and decreased the thymus and bursa index but not cellularity at 1.79 ng TEQ/egg. The cormorant egg extract caused no significant alterations in immune function even though it has been demonstrated as immunotoxic in chicken embryos. However, twofold to threefold increases in total anti-SRBC titers in 28-day-old chicks exposed to 1.2 or 2.4 ng TEQ/egg of cormorant extract were similar to elevations in anti-SRBC titer observed in Caspian tern (Sterna caspia) chicks from a highly OC-contaminated site in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Posthatch exposure to OC through fish consumption in addition to in ovo OC exposure might be associated with the immune modulation reported in wild birds. Chicks in this study might have begun to compensate for embryonic immunotoxicity by the ages at which we studied them.
15946634	We examined the estrogenic effect of 2,2'4,4'5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) on the rockfish, Sebastes schlegeli. We measured levels of plasma estradiol-17beta (E(2)) and testosterone (T) by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Plasma concentrations of T and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone in female and male fish injected with PCB 153 using two dosages (0.16 mg/kg body weight. and 0.57 mg/kg) did not differ significantly between sexes or from sham-injected controls of the same sex. Plasma concentrations of E(2) in females injected with PCB 153 (both levels) increased at 12 and 24 h. Concentrations of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) in females increased 72 h after injection with PCB 153 and reached 0.38 and 1.25 mg/mL, respectively. No VTG was detected in males injected with the same dosage. These results suggest that PCB 153 may lead to the production VTG in female rockfish through a synergistic effect with E(2), resulting in indirect disruption of the aromatization process.
21783863	Lower chlorinated PCBs can damage DNA directly or via free radical mechanisms. In order to assess the DNA-damaging potential of PCBs in humans, blood samples were collected from Inuit population from Salluit, Northern Canada. Their diet comprises blubber from sea mammals and fatty fish, which accumulate non-biodegradable PCBs at varying levels. The 103 samples thus collected were categorized into low-, medium- and high-PCB exposure groups. A comprehensive (32)P-postlabeling adductomics technology, which allows measure differences in DNA adduct profiles of polar and lipophilic adducts between control and exposure groups, was applied to these samples to assess the effect of PCB on DNA damage. The adduct patterns obtained were qualitatively similar to other human tissues studied previously. A range of highly polar to lipophilic subgroups of adducts were detected. The known oxidative lesion, 8-oxodG was predominant. While some individual adducts appear to accumulate with increasing PCB levels, a definitive association could not be made. A possible confounder effect of selenium is discussed.
17045555	A simple procedure for the determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human serum using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was developed. The analysis was carried out by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with electron capture detector (ECD). A 2(7-4) Plackett-Burman reduced factorial design for screening and a central composite design for optimizing the significant variables were applied. A 100 microm PDMS fiber, 3/5 headspace ratio (3 ml in 5 ml vial), 85 degrees C extraction temperature, 50 min extraction time, and 1 ml of acidic solution (pH 3) added to 1 ml of diluted serum (1:1) were chosen for the best response in HS extraction mode. The detection limits found were from 1 pg/ml (PCB 167) to 52 pg/ml (beta-HCH), the relative standard deviation for the procedure varied from 3% (PCB 52) to 12% (PCB 189) and the accuracy was checked by using validated solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. The method that avoids the use of clean-up steps and the hazardous solvents enabled reliable determinations of the OCPs and the PCBs except beta-HCH. The method was applied to the analysis of 33 human serum samples. The most abundant target compound was p-p'-DDE (range, 0.3-8.0 ng/ml; median value, 2.1 ng/ml). Among the PCBs the prevalent congeners were 138, 153 and 180.
3093646	Liver weight, liver and urinary ascorbic acid levels and serum cholesterol concentration were higher in rats fed polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) than in controls. The influences of methionine, cystine and potassium sulfate on these metabolic responses were studied. Methionine or equivalent moles of cystine or potassium sulfate were added to a basal diet containing 10% soy protein isolate. The basal diet contained 0.3% of total sulfur-containing amino acids (S-AAs). When methionine was added to the basal diet, maximum gain in body weight was obtained with 0.5% of dietary S-AAs, while the highest values in serum cholesterol and urinary ascorbic acid were obtained with 0.8% of dietary S-AAs in rats fed PCB. Dietary addition of cystine had little effect on body weight gain. Nevertheless, in rat fed PCB, urinary ascorbic acid and serum cholesterol were significantly higher in rats fed the cystine-supplemented diet than in those fed the unsupplemented diet. Addition of potassium sulfate had no effect on body weight gain, urinary ascorbic acid or serum cholesterol. These results suggest that more S-AAs are required for the highest metabolic response to PCB than for maximum growth, and the higher requirement for S-AAs cannot be replaced by inorganic sulfate.
22099537	Accumulation of organochlorine compounds is well studied in aquatic food chains whereas little information is available from terrestrial food chains. This study presents data of organochlorine levels in tissue and plasma samples of 15 critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) and other 55 wild carnivores belonging to five species from three natural areas of Spain (Doñana National Park, Sierra Morena and Lozoya River) and explores their relationship with species diet. The Iberian lynx, with a diet based on the consumption of rabbit, had lower PCB levels (geometric means, plasma: <0.01 ng mL(-1), liver: 0.4ngg(-1) wet weight, fat: 87 ng g(-1)lipid weight) than other carnivores with more anthropic and opportunistic foraging behavior, such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes; plasma: 1.11 ng mL(-1), liver: 459 ng g(-1), fat: 1984 ng g(-1)), or with diets including reptiles at higher proportion, such as the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon; plasma: 7.15 ng mL(-1), liver: 216 ng g(-1), fat: 540 ng g(-1)), or the common genet (Genetta genetta; liver: 466 ng g(-1), fat: 3854 ng g(-1)). Chlorinated pesticides showed interspecific variations similar to PCBs. Organochlorine levels have declined since the 80s in carnivores from Doñana National Park, but PCB levels are still of concern in Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra; liver: 3873-5426 ng g(-1)) from the industrialized region of Madrid.
15610856	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) are known to bind to transthyretin (TTR) in vitro, possibly explaining their bioaccumulation, rodent toxicity, and presumed human toxicity. Herein, we show that several OH-PCBs bind selectively to TTR in blood plasma; however, only one of the PCBs tested binds TTR in plasma. Some of the OH-PCBs displace thyroid hormone (T4) from TTR, rationalizing the toxicity observed in rodents, where TTR is the major T4 transporter. Thyroid binding globulin and albumin are the major T4 carriers in humans, making it unlikely that enough T4 could be displaced from TTR to be toxic. OH-PCBs are excellent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors in vitro because they bind to the TTR tetramer, imparting kinetic stability under amyloidogenic denaturing conditions. Four OH-PCB/TTR cocrystal structures provide further insight into inhibitor binding interactions.
11381865	In 1989, the level of Aroclor 1254 (a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls with 42 percent chlorine by weight) in fish collected from a recreational pond in Toledo, Ohio, was reported to be 44.4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), prompting local health officials to declare a "no fishing advisory" for the pond. A second study conducted in 1990 did not identify elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish tissue. In other words, the two studies gave conflicting results. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of Aroclor in fish tissues and then evaluate whether consumption of fish from the pond would pose a serious health risk. Fish samples collected on several occasions in 1998 and 1999 were filleted, and tissues were analyzed, as composite or individual samples, with gas chromatography. The levels of Aroclor 1254 ranged from 0.2 mg/kg in white crappies to 1.0 mg/kg in carp. These levels, while far less than the level reported in 1989, nevertheless were greater than 0.05 mg/kg, which is the maximum level established by the Great Lakes Fish Advisory Task Force for "no restriction in fish consumption." Levels of other Aroclor formulations ranged from less than the 0.02 mg/kg (the minimum detectable limit) to 0.1 mg/kg. Given current knowledge about the potential health consequence of exposure to PCBs and the results of this study, the authors have recommended that local health officials develop a new fish consumption guideline for PCBs. Any decisions about maintaining or lifting the restrictions on the pond, however, should be based on additional studies that determine the levels of other chemicals that are present in the pond and deemed hazardous to human health.
22994577	Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are postulated to act as endocrine disrupters. In the ongoing Duisburg birth cohort study, started in 2000-2002, influence of persistent organic pollutants (POP) on child development was monitored. For the first time, associations were reported between prenatal and postnatal PCDD/F and PCB exposures and early endocrinological changes concerning adrenarchal development. PCDD/F and PCB concentrations were measured in blood samples taken in wk 32 of pregnancy and in breast milk using gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS). At the age of 6-7 and 8-9 yr, serum samples were collected from 111 children. The samples were assayed for the sex hormones testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and 17-OH-progesterone (17-OHP) by using an automated chemiluminescence assay system. Analyses of repeated measurements of DHEA-S serum levels were performed by linear regression analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Linear regression analysis showed a positive association between DHEA-S and breast milk levels of PCDD/F and PCB expressed as toxicity equivalents according to toxicity equivalent factors published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 (WHO(2005)-TEq) (increase of 29%, geometric mean ratio, GMR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1. 58 per doubling of PCDD/F + PCB WHO(2005)-TEq levels). Results for the association with the WHO(2005)-TEq levels in blood of mothers were in the same direction (increase of 15%, GMR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93-1.42 per doubling of PCDD/F + PCB WHO(2005)-TEq levels), but not significant. Data indicate that PCDD/F and PCB exposure in infancy may influence DHEA-S serum levels in prepubertal children. Increased DHEA-S serum levels are considered to indicate acceleration of the adrenal maturation.
19482333	Levels of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs were measured in 16 pooled samples of serum from a total of 322 adults in the general population, to coincide with the start-up of a new municipal solid urban waste treatment plant in Biscay, Basque Country (Spain). Two hundred and eighty-three individual serum samples were also obtained, in which the most common PCBs (28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) were quantified. The samples were taken from four geographical zones: two from the metropolitan area of Bilbao, located less than 2 km from the plant and with high traffic density (Zones E1 and E2), a third located 5 km from the plant in an urban area of Bilbao, also with high traffic density (Zone C1) and the fourth located 20 km from the plant, in a municipality with minimal industrial activity and low traffic density (Zone C2), the latter two being out of the path of the prevailing winds. The median levels of dioxins+furans were similar by zone: E1=24.3, E2=27.3, C1=21.3, C2=18.8 pg g(-1) lipid (p=0.362); by sex: 20.2 vs. 22.6 pg g(-1) lipid in men and women (p=0.328); and by age: 20.8 vs. 21.3 pg g(-1) lipid in subjects aged 20-44 and 45-69 (p=0.505). No detectable levels of PCBs 52 and 101 were found. Significant differences by zone were found only for PCB 180 (p=0.041), with higher values in Zone C2, the zone with the lowest presumed contamination levels. Dioxin-like PCBs (p<0.001) and the most common PCBs (138, 153, 180) (p<0.001) were both statistically associated with age, higher values being found in the 45-69 age group.
14753783	This study investigated the feasibility of applying liquid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in blood plasma. An efficient and simple extraction technique has been developed for the enrichment of PCBs from human blood plasma samples using single-step liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) in conjunction with a hollow fibre membrane (HFM). An eight PCB congener mixture was spiked into 2.5 ml of blood plasma, and the solution was then adjusted to pH 10.5 with a salinity of 20% (w/v) prior to making the total volume to 5 ml with ultrapure water. The porous HFM, filled with 3 microl of organic solvent, was then immersed into the solution, which was continuously agitated at 700 rpm for 30 min. Extract (1 microl) containing the pre-concentrated analytes was then injected into a GC-MS without further pre-treatment. Using an optimised extraction procedure, a large enrichment factor of the analytes, i.e. up to 241-fold was achieved in 30 min. The procedure resulted in a relative standard deviation of < 11% (n = 6), and a linear calibration range from 2.5 to 150 microg/l (r > 0.999), and detection limits between 0.07 and 0.94 microg/l, respectively. To demonstrate the feasibility of the procedure, PCB concentrations were determined in actual blood samples collected from the local population in Singapore using the optimised LPME technique.
2496968	Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to affect reproduction in experimental animals and in human beings following intoxication. The concentrations of PCBs and other organochlorine compounds were determined in blood samples from 120 women hospitalized for miscarriages and 120 full-term pregnancy controls. The average PCB hematic level (reported as Fenclor 54) was higher in women with miscarriages than in control women. No differences were detected as far as the hematic concentrations of hexachlorobenzene and DDT compounds were concerned. The reproductive history of each woman was assessed together with confounding variables on the phenomenon of miscarriage and the factors regarding environmental exposure and food intake. Food consumption did not indicate diet as the main source of PCB intake.
20644494	OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for elevated blood pressure and hypertension in residents of Anniston, Alabama who live near a plant that manufactured polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). METHODS: A total of 758 Anniston residents had multiple measurements of blood pressure, provided information on demographic factors, medications, smoking, and exercise, and provided blood samples for determination of PCBs and total serum lipid. RESULTS: Rates of hypertension increased significantly (P < 0.05) with age and concentration of serum PCBs and were higher in African-Americans (n = 351) than in whites (n = 407). Hypertension also increased with BMI, but was not related to total serum lipid, sex, smoking, or exercise. Among 394 persons not on antihypertensive medication, linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive relation between serum PCB level and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, logistic regression gave odds ratios for the highest to lowest tertiles of total serum PCBs that exceeded 3.5 for both systolic and diastolic hypertension. When analyzed by quintiles of PCBs, the highest odds ratio was in the third quintile, suggesting a low dose effect. CONCLUSION: In individuals not on antihypertensive medication, serum PCB levels were significantly associated with prevalence of hypertension. Significant positive associations were also observed between PCB concentrations and systolic and diastolic blood pressure even in normotensive ranges. The strength of the relationships between PCB exposure and both hypertension and blood pressure suggests that PCB exposure may be an important contributing factor in regulation of blood pressure. 
16475322	The objective of this study was to assess blood concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and their polychlorobiphenylol (OH-PCB) metabolites in humans with a high seafood intake. Samples were obtained from pregnant women in the Faroe Islands in 1994-1995 and from their children at 7 years of age to examine maternal transfer of the compounds to their child, age-dependent metabolism, and temporal changes. Maternal serum was dominated by 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), while 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-153) prevailed in the children's serum seven years later. DecaBDE was present in both mothers and children up to 3 and 6 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. The sigmaPCB concentration in the children averaged about 60% of the concentrations in their mothers, with median levels for both above 1 microg/g lipid weight and .with similar PCB congener patterns. sigmaOH-PCB serum concentrations from the mothers and their children showed ranges of 1.8-36 ng/g wet weight (ww) and 0.49-22 ng/g ww, respectively, with all OH-PCB congener concentrations being lower in the children, except for 2,3,3',4',5-pentachloro-4-biphenylol (4-OH-CB107). Children at 7 years of age are exposed to PCBs at levels only slightly below those of their mothers, and the increased 4-OH-CB107 concentrations in children could be due to age-related differences in PCB metabolism. The PBDE concentrations were similar in both mothers and their children. The main persistent organic pollutant concentrations in the children are most probably due to other environmental exposure than maternal transfer.
22326254	BACKGROUND: One of the suggested health outcomes of PCB exposure is childhood asthma. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to find health relevant biomarkers providing the molecular epidemiological evidence for the positive relationship between exposure to PCBs and childhood asthma. METHODS: Blood samples from fifteen asthmatic children as well as an equal number of non-asthmatic children (average 2 year old) were collected, and were analyzed for PCBs and their select marker expression by using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Among biomarkers examined IL-8 expression was significantly correlated to serum levels of PCB #163+164 (P=0.022), #170 (P=0.046), #177 (P=0.022), #178 (P=0.022) and #180+193 (P=0.046) in a dose-dependent manner, which was found only among asthmatic children. In contrast, COX-2 correlations to individual congener levels were recognized only among control subjects, not among asthmatic subjects. CONCLUSION: Serum concentrations of PCB#163+164, #170, #177, #178 and #180+193 correlate significantly with IL-8 mRNA expressions among asthmatic children. 
21495631	Breast milk samples collected during 2003-2005 from 82 first-time mothers in 24 communities located throughout California contained levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (∑(tri-hexa (8))PBDEs; median = 53.3 ng/g lw, range = 9.60-1291) and polychlorinated biphenyls (∑(12)PCBs; median = 73.4 ng/g lw, range = 22.2-433) that are among the highest in the world. PBDE levels varied 100-fold. BDE-47 was the dominant PBDE congener, with levels exceeding the U.S.EPA Reference Dose (RfD) for neurodevelopmental toxicity (100 ng/kg/day) in most (60%) breast milk samples. In some samples, BDE-209 (2/82) and/or BDE-153 (5/82) were the dominant congeners, suggesting that BDE-209 can transfer to breast milk and/or break down in the mother and transfer to the nursing infant as the lower-brominated PBDEs associated with adverse effects. PBDE levels in California breast milk are approaching those of PCBs, and the trend PBDEs > PCBs may continue as PBDEs migrate from products to the indoor and outdoor environments.
15053652	A semiautomated extraction and cleanup method has been developed for the measurement of eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153). The method employs automated addition of internal standards ((13)C-labeled), addition of formic acid (denaturation agent), and dilution with water prior to automated overnight extraction using a modular solid-phase extraction (SPE) system. Removal of coextracted biogenic materials was performed on a two-layered 3-mL disposable cartridge containing activated silica gel and a mixture of silica gel and sulfuric acid. Sample cleanup was automated using the same modular SPE system. Reproducibility and precision of the liquid handler used for internal standard additions were shown to be 2 and 4%, respectively. Overall reproducibility during processing of eight batches of samples (N = 30/batch, including methods blanks) was below 10% for most analytes. Mean recoveries of the (13)C-labeled internal standards ranged from 69 to 95% for the seven monitored PBDEs; 76 and 98% were recovered for BB-153 and CB-153, respectively.
16209723	To investigate whether the stress response of European eels infected with Anguillicola crassus is influenced by environmental pollutants, experimentally infected eels were exposed to Cd and/or to 3,3', 4,4', 5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). Serum cortisol and glucose concentrations of these eels were monitored over a period of 103 days and were compared with data from infected, unexposed eels as well as with data from uninfected eels. Additionally, the levels of cortisol were correlated with concentrations of Anguillicola-specific antibodies. All eels showed an initial increase of the cortisol levels until day 63. This general elevation of plasma cortisol is most likely due to handling stress, as all eels were repeatedly netted and afterwards inoculated with a feeding tube. At the end of the exposure period eels which were infected and those which were infected and simultaneously exposed to Cd and PCB showed significantly higher levels than the controls. The general course of serum glucose levels in eels resembled that of cortisol. Accordingly, Spearman correlation analysis revealed that an increase in serum cortisol concentrations is correlated with rising levels of glucose. With respect to immune-endocrine interactions a significant negative correlation between cortisol and anti-A. crassus antibodies was found. Our data show that A. crassus is the most potent stressor for European eels among the treatments tested within this study. This is important in terms of ecotoxicological studies as the main effects are caused by parasites rather than chemicals. Accordingly, effects of parasites on the physiological homeostasis of organisms must be considered in ecotoxicology. From the parasitological point of view our results suggest that probably as part of an unbalanced host-parasite interaction A. crassus evokes a strong cortisol response in A. anguilla, thereby suppressing the immune response which in turn enables the parasite to establish. The parasite-induced stress response in the newly adopted European eel might be one of the factors which contributes to the extremely effective colonizing strategy of A. crassus.
6781529	Industrial exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and internal dose were investigated in 80 worker exposed for many years to PCB mixtures with a 42% chlorine content (Pyralene 3010 and Apirolio). PCBs were determined by liquid gas chromatography on samples taken from workroom air, workroom surfaces and tools, the palms of the hand, and the blood of the workers. In the workroom air samples, PCB concentrations ranged from 48 to 275 micrograms/m3. All tested surfaces and tools were heavily contaminated, with a range from 0.2 to 159 micrograms PCBs per cm2 of surface. Considerable amounts of PCBs were detected on the palms of the hands of the workers (2-28 microgram/cm2 of skin surface). In blood, total PCB concentrations from 88 to 1319 micrograms/kg were observed: comparing the blood concentrations of low and high chlorine content biphenyls, a significant difference was found for the low-chlorinated biphenyl concentrations between workers currently exposed and workers exposed only in the past. In groups of workers who were homogeneous as regards work area and job, the PCB concentrations in the blood were closely correlated with the length of actual occupational exposure to these compounds. These findings led to the conclusion that absorption of PCBs in these workers had occurred mainly through the skin, therefore industrial preventive surveillance must take this route of exposure into account. Since blood PCB concentrations appear to be correlated with the length of exposure, PCB determination on whole blood may be used to monitor industrial and environmental exposure to PCBs.
10813583	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are ubiquitous compounds that have tumor-promoting properties if applied together with tobacco-specific carcinogens. It was the purpose of the present study to investigate whether parental smoking by itself will increase the prenatal uptake of such organochloric compounds. With the informed consent of the parents, blood samples were taken from 80 full-term neonates before the first oral feeding. Six PCB congeners (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, and 180) and HCB were analyzed with capillary gas chromatography. Information about parental smoking behavior, the geographic origin of the parents, and their actual and previous working places was recorded. We composed three study groups for statistical analyses: active smoking mothers (n = 12), passive smoking mothers (n = 33), and nonsmoking families (n = 35). Neonates born to active smoking mothers had the highest PCB and HCB concentrations compared with children of passive or nonsmoking mothers. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01) in the cases of PCB 138, total PCB, and HCB. Newborns of passive smoking mothers had higher PCB and HCB concentrations than children of nonsmoking families but lower values than those of active smoking mothers. These differences were statistically significant for all compounds with the exception of PCB 180. It is concluded that active and passive maternal smoking increases the neonatal burden with PCB and HCB.
11574490	BACKGROUND: A case-control study was designed to determine the possible association between chronic exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the occurrence of endometriosis. The study group consisted of 42 infertile endometriosis cases and 27 mechanical infertile controls, both groups attending one of the collaborating Centres for Reproductive Medicine, enrolled between 1996-1998. METHODS: Exposure assessment to dioxin-like compounds was determined through CALUX (chemical-activated luciferase gene expression)-bioassay to measure dioxin-like total toxic equivalents (dioxins and co-planar PCBs), whereas non-co-planar PCBs were determined through chemical analysis. RESULTS: No association was found between median dioxin-like total toxic equivalents (TEQ) and the occurrence of endometriosis in infertile women [cases (n = 34): 29; controls (n = 27): 24; NS]. When patients were subdivided based on an arbitrary cut-off value of 100 pg TEQ/g serum lipids, no statistically significant association between very high exposure to dioxin-like compounds and endometriosis was found [crude odds ratio (OR) = 4.33; confidence interval (CI) 0.49-38.19; NS]. After adjusting for body mass index, and alcohol consumption, the risk increased slightly to OR = 4.6 (CI 0.48-43.62; NS). There was no confounding by age, ovulatory dysfunction, caffeine intake, smoking or exposure to non-co-planar PCBs. CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed no statistically significant association between exposure to dioxin-like compounds and the occurrence of endometriosis in infertile women. 
19842105	Dietary patterns were related to intake and blood concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) and selected non-dioxin-like-PCBs (ndl-PCBs). Intake calculations were based on an extensive food frequency questionnaire and a congener-specific database on concentrations in Norwegian foods. The study (2003) applied a two-step inclusion strategy recruiting representative (n=73) and high consumers (n=111) of seafood and game. Estimated median intakes of sum PCDD/PCDFs and dl-PCBs of the representative and high consumers were 0.78 and 1.25 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg bw/day, respectively. Estimated median intakes of ndl-PCBs (sum chlorinated biphenyl (CB)-28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) were 4.26 and 6.40 ng/kg bw/day. The median blood concentrations of PCDD/PCDFs/dl-PCBs were 28.7 and 35.1 pg TEQ/g lipid, and ndl-PCBs (sum of CB-101, 138, 153 and 180) 252 and 299 ng/g lipid. The Spearman correlations between dietary intake and serum concentration were r=0.34 (p=0.017) for dl-compounds and r=0.37 (p<0.001) for ndl-PCBs. Oily fish was the major source of dl-compounds and ndl-PCBs in high and representative consumers. Four dietary patterns were identified by principal component analysis. Two were related to high intakes, one dominated by oily fish ((Omega-3)), the other by fish liver and seagull eggs ("northern coastal"). Only the latter was closely associated with high blood concentrations of dioxins and PCBs.
11491552	Energy budgets have proven to be a valuable tool for predicting life history from physiological data in terrestrial vertebrates, yet these concepts have not been applied to the physiological effects of contaminants. Contaminants might affect energy budgets by imposing an additional metabolic cost or by reducing the overall amount of energy taken in; either process will reduce the energy available for production (i.e., growth or reproduction). This study examined whole animal energetic effects of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Exposure to PCBs is known to reduce concentrations of plasma thyroid hormones, and thyroid hormones exert strong control over the rate of energy metabolism in mammals. Peromyscus leucopus that were proven breeders were fed PCBs in their food at 0, 10, and 25 ppm. Through lactation, offspring were exposed to PCB from conception and were maintained on the maternal diet to adulthood. No effects were seen on energy metabolism (O2 consumption, measured in adulthood) or on growth, but there were large dose-dependent decreases in thyroid hormone concentrations, particularly T4. The apparent disparity in our data between unchanged metabolic rates and 50% reductions in T4 concentrations can be rationalized by noting that free T3 (the fraction not bound to plasma protein) in treated mice was not significantly different from controls and that metabolism is most strongly influenced by free T3. Overall, this study did not demonstrate any energetic consequences of PCB exposure in P. leucopus at dietary concentrations up to 25 ppm.
18439655	This study was conducted to explore the exposure potential of Chinese residents to PBBs, PBDEs, and PCBs in e-waste disassembly sites in Zhejiang province. The contents of 23 PBB congeners, 12 PBDE congeners, and 27 PCB congeners in hair and in their potential sources, including soil and e-waste, were measured via GC-MS. The levels of PHAHs in the three subfamilies (i.e., the PBBs, PBDEs, and PCBs) were all considerably higher (P<0.05) in hair samples collected from the disassembly sites than from the control site. The highest levels of PBBs (57.77 ng g(-1) dw), PBDEs (29.64 ng g(-1) dw), and PCBs (181.99 ng g(-1) dw) in hair were all found in those from the disassembly site Xinqiu, which are respectively 2, 2, and 10 times more than those observed in hair from the control site Yandang. Among the three subfamilies of PHAHs, PCBs were the most predominant pollutants detected. PBBs, which have very limited information available in China, can be detected at a comparable level with PBDEs in these samples in the study. Therefore, these observations suggested that more attention should be given over the potential for environmental or occupational exposure to PHAHs present in e-waste. By and large, the PHAH levels measured in the hair samples were consistent with those detected in the soil. Hair analysis could thus be a valid screening tool for assessing human PHAHs exposure in and around e-waste disassembly sites.
17665678	The great horned owl (GHO; Bubo virginianus) was used in a multiple lines of evidence study of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposures at the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site (KRSS), Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA. The study examined risks from total PCBs, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQWorld Health Organization [WHO]-Avian Toxicity Equivalency Factor [TEF]), and total DDTs (sum of DDT, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [DDD]; sigmaDDT) by measuring concentrations in eggs and nestling blood plasma in two regions of the KRSS (upper, lower) and an upstream reference area (RA). An ecological risk assessment compared concentrations of the contaminants of concern (COCs) in eggs or plasma to toxicity reference values. Productivity and relative abundance measures for KRSS GHOs were compared with other GHO populations. Egg shell thickness was measured to assess effects of p,p'-DDE. The concentrations of PCBs in eggs were as great as 4.7 x 10(2) and 4.0 x 10(4) ng PCB/g, wet weight at the RA and combined KRSS sites, respectively. Egg TEQ(WHO-Avian) calculated from aryl hydrocarbon receptor-active PCB congeners and WHO TEFs ranged to 8.0 and 1.9 x 10(2) pg TEQ(WHO-Avian)/g, (wet wt) at the RA and combined KRSS, respectively. Egg sigmaDDT concentrations were as great as 4.2 x 10(2) and 5.0 x 10(3) ng sigmaDDT/g (wet wt) at the RA and combined KRSS, respectively. Hazard quotients (HQs) for the upper 95% confidence interval (UCI) (geometric mean) and least observable adverse effect concentration (LOAEC) for COCs in eggs were < or = 1.0 for all sites. Hazard quotient values based on the no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) 95% UCI in eggs were < or = 1.0, except at the LKRSS (PCB HQ = 3.1; TEQ(WHO-Avian) HQ = 1.3). Productivity and relative abundance measures indicated no population level effects in the UKRSS.
9601931	We report on the PCB levels in plasma from 42-month-old children and the factors that determine these levels. We measured the levels of the PCB congeners 118 (2,4,5-3'4' pentachlorobiphenyl (CB)), 138 (2, 3,4-2'4'5'hexaCB), 153 (2,4,5-2'4'5'hexaCB), and 180 (2,3,4, 5-2'4'5'heptaCB) in cord plasma, breast milk, and plasma from 42-month-old children (n = 126) living in the Groningen area, The Netherlands. The sum of the levels of these four congeners was calculated for cord plasma (SigmaPCBcord), breast milk (SigmaPCBmilk), and 42-month plasma (SigmaPCB42mo). SigmaPCBcord was used as a measure of prenatal exposure. Postnatal exposure was assessed in terms of the SigmaPCBmilk and the duration of lactation. In addition, maternal factors including age, body weight and height, parity, and formal education were recorded. In 42-month-old children who have been fully breast-fed for at least six weeks as babies, the median SigmaPCB42mo was 4.5 times as high as that in formula-fed children (0.81 microg/L vs. 0.18 microg/L). The PCB levels in cord blood and human milk and the duration of breast-feeding predict the plasma PCB level at 42 months. Each additional week of full breast-feeding is estimated to result in an increase of 0.3% of the milk PCB level. We concluded that lactation is a major source for the child's PCB body burden at 42 months.
20384381	In the present study, we analyze and characterize the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in serum and breast adipose tissue, and measure TH (total 3,5,5'-triiodothyronine (tT3) and total l-thyroxine (tT4)) levels in serum of Japanese women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 51) to know how PCBs affect thyroid hormone homeostasis. Concentrations of Sigma(90)OH-PCBs in serum and adipose tissues were 630 pg g(-1) serum wet wt. and 140 pg/ g(-1) lipid wt., respectively, and the levels of OH-PCBs in adipose tissues were 4-5 times lower than in serum. The tT3 and tT4 concentrations in serum (n = 20) were 1.3 ng g(-1) serum wet wt. and 62 ng g(-1) serum wet wt., respectively. Among all the OH-PCBs, 4'-OH-CB101/120, 4-OH-CB107/4'-OH-CB108, 3'-OH-CB138, 4-OH-CB146, 3-OH-CB153, 4'-OH-CB172, and 4-OH-CB187 were the dominant isomers in serum. No significant correlation between the concentrations of the TH and OH-PCBs in serum was observed (p > 0.05). The results indicated that the relationship between the OH-PCB levels and the thyroid hormone markers was rare. From analysis of two kinds of human biological samples, it was estimated that OH-PCBs have little effect on thyroid hormone homeostasis.
23155198	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) comprise a ubiquitous class of toxic substances associated with carcinogenic and tumor-promoting effects as well as neurotoxic properties. Reactive oxygen species, which is produced from PCBs, alters blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, which is paralleled by cytoskeletal rearrangements and redistribution and disappearance of tight junction proteins (TJPs) like claudin-5 and occludin. Quercetin, a potent antioxidant present in onion and other vegetables, appears to protect brain cells against oxidative stress, a tissue-damaging process associated with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of quercetin on oxidative stress markers and transcription of transmembrane and cytoplasmic accessory TJPs on cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus of female rats exposed to PCBs. Rats were divided into the following four groups. Group I: received only vehicle (corn oil) intraperitoneally (i.p.); group II: received Aroclor 1254 at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (bwt)/day (i.p); group III: received Aroclor 1254 (i.p.) and simultaneously quercetin 50 mg/kg bwt/day through gavage and group IV: received quercetin alone gavage. From the experiment, the levels of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were observed to increase significantly in cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus as 50%, 25% and 20%, respectively, after exposure to PCB, and the messenger RNA expression of TJP in rats exposed to PCBs is decreased and is retrieved to the normal level simultaneously in quercetin-treated rats. Hence, quercetin can be used as a preventive medicine to PCBs exposure and prevents neurodegenerative disorders. 
9880446	OBJECTIVE: To study possible adverse effects of environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxins on cognitive functioning in young children. METHODS: In a follow-up of the Dutch PCB/Dioxin study, cognitive abilities were assessed with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children in 42-month-old children (n = 395). In a subgroup (n = 193) verbal comprehension was assessed with the Reynell Language Developmental Scales. Prenatal PCB exposure was estimated from the sum of PCBs 118, 138, 153, and 180 (SigmaPCB) in maternal plasma. Lactational exposure was assessed from breast milk PCB and dioxin concentrations, multiplied by the number of weeks of breast-feeding. Current PCB body burden was estimated from SigmaPCB in 42-month-old plasma samples. RESULTS: After adjustment was done for covariables, maternal SigmaPCB was associated with lower scores on the overall cognitive and sequential and simultaneous processing scales of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (all P <.05). The highest exposed group (SigmaPCB >/= 3 microg/L) scored 4 points lower on all 3 scales of the K-ABC when compared with the lowest exposed group (SigmaPCB < 1.5 microg/L). Both lactational exposure and current exposure to PCBs and dioxins were not related to 42-month cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to "background" PCB concentrations is associated with poorer cognitive functioning in preschool children. Children of mothers at the upper end of exposure are especially at risk. Therefore maternal PCB body burden should be reduced, and breast-feeding should not be discouraged. 
16979807	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are widespread, lipophilic environmental pollutants which have been identified as contaminants in almost every component of the global ecosystem including fish, wildlife, and human adipose tissue, breast milk, and serum. Several studies have shown that PCBs can cause oxidative damage to biomolecules, in the form of lipid peroxidation, modulation of antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative stress. In the present study, we have sought to investigate the effects of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) on antioxidant status of PCB-induced toxicity in male Wistar rats. The protective effect of alpha-tocopherol (50mg/kg body weight/day) was tested in PCB-induced toxicity in rat liver, lung, and kidney. We report here that the oral supplementation of alpha-tocopherol was found to maintain the cellular redox status by maintaining the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase accompanied with glutathione and vitamin E levels and down regulation in the levels of lipid peroxides, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxides generation in PCB treated rats. Therefore, our present study demonstrates the PCB-induced deficits in antioxidant enzyme activities and increase in reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation levels in liver, kidney, and lung which can be overcome through simultaneous supplementation with alpha-tocopherol.
23708622	Sensitive and reliable methods for simultaneous determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in limited volumes of human serum or plasma need to be further documented especially when they accumulate at low levels that are still capable of disrupting endocrine and immune functions, and affecting neurodevelopment and reproduction. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a sensitive and quantitative method that simultaneously quantifies PBDEs and PCBs in 0.5 ml of human serum or plasma. We optimized a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method and used silica particle purification for the extraction of PBDEs and PCBs. Two multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) transitions were optimized for each congener. The sum of the transitions was used for quantification, and their abundance ratios were used for identification. The combined method optimization techniques resulted in limits of detection from 3 to 145 pg/ml for 10 PBDEs and 1-12 pg/ml for 15 PCBs. Method was solidly validated by analyzing serum fortified with a certified PBDE and PCB standard mixture from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The accuracy was 88-118% and day-to-day precision was within 19%. The method was successfully applied to quantify native concentrations of PBDE and PCB in commercially available human serum. The sensitivity and selectivity of the GC/EI-MS/MS analysis enables it to be the method of choice for investigations of exposures to PBDE and PCB congeners, especially when sample volume is limited.
18470317	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) may affect the female reproductive system in animals and humans. In 1978-1979, a mass poisoning occurred in central Taiwan due to PCB/PCDF-contaminated cooking oil; this incident was called Yucheng ("oil disease" in Chinese). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to determine whether PCB/PCDF exposure affected fertility in exposed women. METHODS: After the event, we followed the exposed individuals and a reference group who were sex-, age-, and community-matched. In 2003, we obtained fertility histories from Yucheng and reference women by telephone interview. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox regression to compare time to pregnancy (TTP) between Yucheng and reference women, and we performed multiple logistic regression to determine whether PCB/PCDF exposure caused infertility. RESULTS: In total, 412 women responded, with a median TTP of 4 months in Yucheng women and 3 months in reference women (p = 0.019). After adjusting for confounders by Cox regression, we found a fecundability ratio of 0.90 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-1.00] for Yucheng women. Among the 408 women who had non-contraceptive sexual activity for > 12 months, 19.7% of Yucheng women and 9.7% of reference women did not become pregnant (i.e., they were infertile). After we adjusted for confounders by logistic regression, the infertility odds ratio was 2.34 (95% CI, 1.23-4.59) for Yucheng women compared with the reference group. CONCLUSIONS: We found prolonged TTP and reduced fertility among women previously exposed to PCBs/PCDFs. Because of the limited sample size and the relatively small decrease in the fertility rate, these effects require cautious interpretation and further investigation for confirmation. 
20945409	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are endocrine disrupting chemicals that disturb normal development of embryonic brains. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between maternal plasma PCB concentration and infant behavioral characteristics in mother-infant interactions. We grouped 20 pregnant cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) into higher and lower PCB exposure groups; monkeys in the higher PCB group had PCB concentrations above 15 pg/g, which is representative of natural exposure levels. Maternal PCB concentration correlated negatively with infant behaviors (approach, look, proximity, locomotion) at the age of 6 months (p < .05), when an increase in these behaviors should normally occur. These results suggest that maternal PCB exposure may affect the development of infant social behavior in cynomolgus monkeys. Furthermore, this study provides primate evidence to support observations of associations between behavioral and learning disabilities and prenatal exposure to PCBs in humans.
23598430	Miniaturized pressurized solvent extraction vessels were used to examine polychlorinated biphenyl congener (PCB) concentrations in 0.2 g sample sizes of whole blood, liver, heart and breast tissue sampled from twelve Great Lakes Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). This study successfully supported the blood extraction method, previously validated only using laboratory prepared blood samples, using field samples. In situ clean-up offered excellent sample throughput without degradation of GC-MS performance; using this method, extraction, instrument analysis and data interpretation for 100 samples could be accomplished within a one to two week time period. Results indicated contamination in the blood (∑PCB = 1.9-13 ng g(-1) ww), liver (∑PCB = 0.8-11 ng g(-1) ww), breast (∑PCB = <0.1-9 ng g(-1) ww) and heart tissue (∑PCB = <0.1-6 ng g(-1) ww). Quality control included the analysis of blank samples, NIST SRM 1589a and a duplicate of each sample type (blood or tissue). All blank samples were below the method detection limit, SRM values were within 70% of their certified values and duplicates were within 70% of each other. Correlations were examined for the suite of analysed congeners between blood and various tissues; within select individuals a strong and significant correlation was observed. TEQs were calculated and compared against known toxicity data for bird species. Based on the PCB levels found in this study, no adverse health effects are expected in the birds themselves. ∑PCB concentrations in the breast tissue were also compared against both the Canadian and American guidelines for the consumption of edible poultry and based on these values, the Mallards used in this research would be safe for human consumption.
22264925	The aim of this study was to examine the plasma concentrations and prevalence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hydroxylated PCB-metabolites (OH-PCBs) in polar bear (Ursus maritimus) mothers (n=26) and their 4 months old cubs-of-the-year (n=38) from Svalbard to gain insight into the mother-cub transfer, biotransformation and to evaluate the health risk associated with the exposure to these contaminants. As samplings were performed in 1997/1998 and 2008, we further investigated the differences in levels and pattern of PCBs between the two sampling years. The plasma concentrations of Σ(21)PCBs (1997/1998: 5710 ± 3090 ng/g lipid weight [lw], 2008: 2560 ± 1500 ng/g lw) and Σ(6)OH-PCBs (1997/1998: 228 ± 60 ng/g wet weight [ww], 2008: 80 ± 38 ng/g ww) in mothers were significantly lower in 2008 compared to in 1997/1998. In cubs, the plasma concentrations of Σ(21)PCBs (1997/1998: 14680 ± 5350 ng/g lw, 2008: 6070 ± 2590 ng/g lw) and Σ(6)OH-PCBs (1997/1998: 98 ± 23 ng/g ww, 2008: 49 ± 21 ng/g ww) were also significantly lower in 2008 than in 1997/1998. Σ(21)PCBs in cubs was 2.7 ± 0.7 times higher than in their mothers. This is due to a significant maternal transfer of these contaminants. In contrast, Σ(6)OH-PCBs in cubs were approximately 0.53 ± 0.16 times the concentration in their mothers. This indicates a lower maternal transfer of OH-PCBs compared to PCBs. The majority of the metabolite/precursor-ratios were lower in cubs compared to mothers. This may indicate that cubs have a lower endogenous capacity to biotransform PCBs to OH-PCBs than polar bear mothers. Exposure to PCBs and OH-PCBs is a potential health risk for polar bears, and the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in cubs from 2008 were still above levels associated with health effects in humans and wildlife.
14659948	Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are recognized environmental endocrine disruptors, which are environmentally persistent and may bio-accumulate in human bodies. Pregnant and nursing women may pass these pollutants to their babies both trans-placentally and lactationally. We measured and examined correlations of the levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in perinatal venous serum, placenta, umbilical-cord serum (representing prenatal exposure), and breast milk (postnatal exposure). Subjects included pregnant women without clinical complication between the ages of 25 and 35, who delivered their babies during 2000.12.01 and 2001.11.30 in central Taiwan. A total of 20 participants were randomly selected from those provided the four biological specimens for analysis of 17 PCDD/Fs, and 12 dioxin-like PCBs and six indicator PCBs using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Higher PCDD/F levels were found in placenta (10.3 TEq-pg/g lipid) and venous serum (9.1 TEq-pg/g lipid) compared to those in breast milk (7.6 TEq-pg/g lipid). Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses showed well association of PCDD/F and PCB levels between different specimens. The total dioxin/PCB level in milk, venous and cord serum can be well predicted by that in placenta through regression functions. This first study of multi-specimen correlation further established rather consistent ratios of these chemical concentrations in various specimens relative to those in venous serum.
8628610	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of in utero and lactational exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins on the mental and psychomotor development of infants. DESIGN: Prenatal PCB exposure was estimated from the levels in maternal plasma during the last month of pregnancy. Postnatal PCB and dioxin exposure of breastfed infants was calculated from levels in human milk samples and the duration of breastfeeding. Infants were examined at 3, 7, and 18 months of age with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Voluntary sample of 207 mother-infant pairs. One hundred five infants were breastfed and 102 were bottle-fed. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Higher in utero exposure to PCBs was associated with lower psychomotor scores at 3 months of age: a doubling of the PCB load resulted in a decrease of 3 points. Breastfed infants scored significantly higher on the psychomotor score at 7 months of age, compared with formula-fed infants. However, when corrected for confounders, the psychomotor score of the 66% highest-exposed breastfed infants ( > 756 pg total PCB-dioxin toxic equivalent) was negatively influenced by this postnatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins, and was comparable to the psychomotor score of the formula-fed infants. Breastfed infants also scored higher on the mental scale at 7 months of age in a dose-dependent way. There was no significant influence of the perinatal PCB and dioxin exposure on the mental outcome at 3 and 7 months of age. At 18 months of age neither the mental nor the psychomotor score was related to perinatal PCB or dioxin exposure, nor to the duration of breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal PCB exposure has a small negative effect on the psychomotor score at 3 months of age. PCB and dioxin exposure through breastfeeding has an adverse effect on the psychomotor outcome at 7 months of age. The mental outcome at 7 months of age is positively influenced by breastfeeding per se; the perinatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins does not influence this outcome. At 18 months of age the development is affected neither by PCB and dioxin exposure nor by feeding type. 
18589988	To investigate the occupational exposure levels to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), indoor dust (n = 3) in workshops and hair samples from male workers (n = 64) were collected at two electrical and electronic equipmentwaste (E-waste) dismantling factories located in the LQ area in east China in July 11--13, 2006. Pre- and postworkshift urines (64 of each) were also collected from the workers to study oxidative damage to DNA using 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) as a biomarker. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PCDD/F-WHO-TEQs, PBDEs, PCBs and PCB-WHO-TEQs were (50.0 +/- 8.1) x 10(3), 724.1 +/- 249.6, (27.5 +/- 5.8) x 10(6), (1.6 +/- 0.4) x 10(9), (26.2 +/- 3.0) x 10(3) pg/g dry weight (dw) in dust, and (2.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(3),42.4 +/- 9.3, (870.8 +/- 205.4) x 10(3), (1.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(6), 41.5 +/- 5.5 pg/g dw in hair, respectively. The homologue and congener profiles in the samples demonstrated that high concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs, and PCBs were originated from open burning of E-waste. The 8-OHdG levels were detected at 6.40 +/- 1.64 micromol/mol creatinine in preworkshift urines. However, the levels significantly increased to 24.55 +/- 5.96 micromol/mol creatinine in postworkshift urines (p < 0.05). Then, it is concluded that there is a high cancer risk originated from oxidative stress indicated by the elevated 8-OHdG levels in the E-waste dismantling workers exposed to high concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs, and PCBs.
10092447	Samples of blood and milk were obtained from lactating women participating in the New York State Angler study. A total of seven women gave one blood and one milk sample at time intervals between blood and milk collection different for each woman. The time between samples varied from 3 to 318 days. One subject provided a second milk sample 219 days after the first milk sample. The samples were analyzed for 69 PCB congeners, DDE (a metabolite of DDT), Mirex, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). Lipid content was determined by gravimetric analysis. The congener profiles in serum and milk were similar for each individual but different among all subjects. The sum of the concentrations of the congeners present above the limit of detection was used to estimate the total PCB concentration that was in the range of 2.6 to 5.8 ng/g of serum and 3.5 to 14.1 ng/g of milk. The ratio of serum to milk concentrations varied from 0.18 to 1.66 with a mean of 0.65+/-0.49 showing no consistency among individuals prior to adjusting the data for lipid content. The total PCB levels normalized for lipid content were 320-728 ng/g of serum lipid and 239-428 ng/g of milk lipid. The range of the lipid adjusted serum/milk ratio was 1.1 to 2.8 and the mean+/-SD serum/milk ratio was 1.9+/-0.5. The ranges of lipid adjusted serum concentration of DDE, HCB, and Mirex were 95 to 591, 8 to 48, and 3 to 29 ng/g lipid, respectively. The ranges of lipid adjusted milk concentration of DDE, HCB, and Mirex were 90 to 577, 11 to 22, and 1 to 10 ng/g lipid, respectively. For DDE, HCB, and Mirex, the means of the individual lipid adjusted serum to milk ratios were 1.5+/-0.7, 2.5+/-1.5, and 5. 3+/-4.6, respectively. Considerable differences were found among lipid adjusted concentrations of these environmental pollutants in serum and milk samples from the same individual. This suggests that body burden estimates in lactating women using different matrices may not be equivalent even when lipid adjusted values are used.
6403348	Polychlorinated biphenyls and some organochlorine insecticides (DDT isomers and their metabolites, lindane (gamma-BHC), dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide) were assessed in the serum of 17 women with recent missed abortions, 7 women who experienced one or several missed abortions in their past, and 7 women with normal, second trimester pregnancy. Fifty-three percent of the cases of recent missed abortion had PCB serum levels higher than the mean plus two standard deviations of the control group. The mean PCB serum level in women with recent missed abortion and relatively high PCB serum levels was significantly different from that of the control group (103.04 versus 20.69 ppb, P less than 0.001). The mean PCB serum level of the former missed abortions group was also significantly different from that of the control group (82.00 versus 20.69 ppb, P less than 0.001). The quantity of the higher chlorinated biphenyl homologues (penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls) was increased in the high PCB level, missed abortion group and in the former missed abortion group, while the lower chlorinated biphenyl homologues were decreased in these groups in comparison with the control group. The percentage of total o,p'-DDT serum level, as related to total DDT, showed an increase in the high PCB level, recent missed abortion and in the former missed abortion groups, in comparison with the control group (36.18 and 48.98 versus 25.57, respectively). The fact that the former missed abortion group showed increased PCB serum levels similar to those found in the high PCB level, recent missed abortion group confirms the existence of an association between relatively high PCB serum levels and the occurrence of missed abortion. The possible role of PCBs in the occurrence of missed abortion is discussed.
16135940	BACKGROUND: In developed countries, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous contaminants of the environment, including foods. Within the range of the resulting low-level exposure, associations of PCBs with lower birth weight have been observed in several studies. METHODS: To examine further the association of PCBs with birth outcomes, we measured serum levels in 1034 pregnant women who were enrolled in the U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project in 1959 to 1965 before PCB manufacturing was banned. RESULTS: The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth among those with PCB levels of >/=4 microg/L of total PCBs, compared with those with <2 microg/L, was 1.1 (95% confidence interval = 0.6-2.2); for the same exposure contrast, the odds ratio for delivering an infant who was small-for-gestational-age at birth was 1.6 (0.7-3.7). Birth weight and length of gestation were essentially unrelated to PCB level. CONCLUSIONS: In these data, maternal levels of PCBs during pregnancy were essentially unrelated to preterm birth, birth weight, or length of gestation. An association of PCBs with small-for-gestational-age birth was observed, but the results were inconclusive and occurred in the absence of an overall decrease in birth weight. 
14639129	Some PCB congeners have shown oestrogenic effects, and this has raised concern that they may increase the risk of breast cancer. In this article we provide a quantitative review of the epidemiologic evidence on environmental exposure to PCBs and breast cancer risk. The vast majority of prospective and retrospective studies did not find any association between total PCB concentrations and breast cancer risk. No association was found for congeners in groups I (potentially oestrogenic) and III (biologically persistent phenobarbital-type cytochrome P450 inducers), according to the classification proposed by Wolff and Toniolo, while less consistent results were reported for group II (potentially anti-oestrogenic and immunotoxic, dioxin-like). Two studies found a threefold risk of postmenopausal breast cancer for women with an A2455G base change in exon 7 of the polymorphic CYP1A1 gene (a member of the cytochrome P450 family) and high PCB levels, compared with women with two wild-type alleles and low PCB, based however on very few cases. Thus, the epidemiological evidence does not support the hypothesis of an association of environmental exposure to PCBs in adulthood in the general population and risk of breast cancer, although uncertainties remain for selected subgroups of women or individual PCB congeners.
3097319	Binding energies to human plasma prealbumin using the energy minimization program AMBER are found for a series of polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzodioxins, and dibenzofuran. Corrections for solvation free energies of the chlorinated analogues lead to estimates of the differential free energies of complex formation. These are compared in a number of cases to known experimental log (KPCB/Kref) values. The theory correctly separates strong, intermediate, and nonbinders. On the basis of calculations, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran are predicted to be strong binders, 3,3',5,5'-tetrachlorodiphenoquinone is predicted to be a weak binder, and octachlorodibenzodioxin is predicted to not bind at all. This theoretical model for prealbumin interactions may be of use in estimating the toxic potential of PCBs and related halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons of environmental importance.
21448704	A sensitive and selective method for the trace determination of 3, 3', 4, 4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77) by using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a fluorescence probe was introduced. Under optimum conditions, the enhanced fluorescence intensity was proportional to the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls in the range of 8.9 × 10(-8)-5.0 × 10(-6) mol L(-1) for PCB77, and 5.0 × 10(-7)-5.0 × 10(-6) mol L(-1) for 2, 2', 5, 5'-tetrachlorbiphenyl (PCB52). The detection limits (S/N = 3) of PCB77 and PCB52 were 2.6 × 10(-8) mol L(-1) and 2.9 × 10(-7) mol L(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the fluorescence enhancement mechanism was discussed in detail. Results indicated that fluorescence enhancement of the system originated from the formation of BSA-PCBs complexes. In addition, PCBs were mainly bound to the tyrosine residues in BSA molecules.
18627595	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous industrial chemicals that persist in the environment and in human fatty tissue. PCBs are related to a class of compounds known as dioxins, specifically 2,3,7,8-TCDD (tetrachloro-dibenzodioxin), which has been implicated as a cause of altered sex ratio, especially in relation to paternal exposures. METHODS: In the 1960's, serum specimens were collected from pregnant women participating in the Child Health and Development Study in the San Francisco Bay Area. The women were interviewed and their serum samples stored at -20 degrees C. For this study, samples were thawed and a total of eleven PCBs were determined in 399 specimens. Secondary sex ratio, or sex ratio at birth, was evaluated as a function of maternal serum concentrations using log-binomial and logistic regression, controlling for hormonally active medications taken during pregnancy. RESULTS: The relative risk of a male birth decreased by 33% comparing women at the 90th percentile of total PCBs with women at the 10th percentile (RR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.94; p = 0.02), or by approximately 7% for each 1 mug/L increase in total PCB concentration. Although some congener-specific associations with sex ratio were only marginally statistically significant, all nine PCB congeners with < 30% of samples below the LOQ showed the same direction of association, an improbable finding under the null hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to PCBs may be detrimental to the success of male sperm or to the survival of male embryos. Findings could be due to contaminants, metabolites or PCBs themselves. 
17275933	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a widespread aquatic contaminant and are present in both wild and hatchery raised Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. The possible sub-lethal alterations in smolt physiology and behavior due to PCB exposure of salmon have not been widely examined. In this study, we examined the effects of the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 on survival and smolt development of Atlantic salmon. In separate experiments, fish were exposed as yolk-sac larvae or as juveniles just prior to the parr-smolt transformation in April to 1 microgl(-1) (PCB-1) or 10 microgl(-1) (PCB-10) aqueous Aroclor 1254 (A1254), or vehicle for 21 days. After exposure, yolk-sac larvae were reared at ambient conditions for 1 year, until the peak of smolting the following May. Juveniles were sampled immediately after exposure. Both groups were assessed for behavioral, osmoregulatory, and endocrine disruption of smolt development at the peak of smolting. PCB-1 and PCB-10 treated yolk-sac larvae exhibited significant increases in the rate of opercular movement after 14 and 21 days of exposure. At the peak of smolting, prior exposure as yolk-sac larvae to PCB-1 did not affect behavior, while PCB-10 dramatically decreased volitional preference for seawater. Neither concentration of A1254 had long-term effects on the osmoregulatory or endocrine parameters measured in animals exposed as yolk-sac larvae. Juvenile fish exposed to PCB-1 or PCB-10 during smolting exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in preference for seawater. Fish treated with the higher dose of A1254 also exhibited a 50% decrease in gill Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and a 10% decrease in plasma chloride levels in freshwater. In addition, plasma triiodothyronine was reduced 35-50% and plasma cortisol 58% in response to exposure to either concentration; whereas plasma thyroxine, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor I levels were unaffected. These results indicate that the effects of exposure to A1254 may vary according to developmental stage. Exposure to A1254 in the freshwater environment can inhibit preparatory adaptations that occur during smolting, thereby reducing marine survival and sustainability of salmon populations.
11266329	Pentachlorophenol (PCP), hexachlorocyclohexane-[alpha], -beta, and -[gamma] (HCH-[alpha], -beta, and -[gamma]), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are widely distributed industrial chemicals. They are suspected to induce immunologic impairments in exposed individuals. We examined dose-response relationships of blood levels of these chemicals with cellular (numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations, in vitro lymphocyte response) or humoral (plasma cytokine levels, immunoglobulin autoantibodies) immunologic dysfunctions. We studied 146 patients who had been occupationally exposed primarily to PCBs for more than 6 months. Lymphocyte subpopulations, in vitro responses to mitogens and allogeneic stimulator cells, plasma neopterin, cytokines, soluble cytokine receptors, soluble adhesion molecules, anti-Ig autoantibodies, and liver transaminases were determined. Blood levels of the different compounds were strongly correlated with one another. There were only weak dose-response relationships between blood levels of PCBs with cellular immune parameters, and of HCHs and HCB with humoral immune parameters. An exception was the statistically significant negative association of HCB with interferon-[gamma] (IFN-[gamma]), indicating that HCB has a significant impact on Th1 lymphocytes. Patients with HCB blood levels above the mean of 1,109 ng/L more often had undetectable IFN-[gamma] blood levels than patients below the mean. Patients with increased PCB 138 (> 710 ng/L) had more frequently undetectable interleukin-4 blood levels than patients with PCB 138 below the mean, and patients with increased PCB 101 (> 31 ng/L) more often had low DR+ cell counts in the blood (< 190/microL) than patients with PCB 101 below the mean. To assess possible cumulative effects, we compared patients who had blood levels of all compounds below background with patients who had blood levels of all compounds above background. Patients with low or absent blood levels of the compounds studied had higher IFN-[gamma] plasma levels, providing some evidence for a cumulative effect of several weakly active compounds. In conclusion, exposure to PCBs, HCB, or HCHs is associated with weak immunologic abnormalities. These results contrast with those obtained in earlier studies of blood levels of PCP, which showed a strong dose-dependent relationship with immunologic impairments. Our data suggest that long-term exposure of patients to HCB suppresses IFN-[gamma] production.
21187307	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the associations of serum dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with longitudinally assessed growth measurements among peripubertal Russian boys. METHODS: A total of 499 boys from Chapaevsk, Russia, aged 8 to 9 years were enrolled in the study from 2003 to 2005 and were followed prospectively for 3 years. Blood samples were collected and physical examinations were conducted at entry and repeated at annual study visits. Multivariate mixed-effects regression models for repeated measures were used to examine the associations of serum dioxins and PCBs with longitudinal measurements of BMI, height, and height velocity. RESULTS: Serum dioxin (total 2005 toxic equivalency [TEQ] median: 21.1 pg/g lipid) and PCBs (median sum of PCBs: 250 ng/g lipid) were measured in 468 boys. At study entry and during 3 years of follow-up, >50% of the boys had age-adjusted BMI and height z scores within 1 SD of World Health Organization-standardized mean values for age. Boys in the highest exposure quintile of the sum of dioxin and PCB concentrations and total TEQs had a significant decrease in mean BMI z scores of 0.67 for dioxins and TEQs and 1.04 for PCBs, compared with boys in the lowest exposure quintile. Comparison of the highest versus the lowest quintile revealed that higher serum PCB concentrations were associated with significantly lower height z scores (mean z-score decrease: 0.41) and height velocity (mean decrease: 0.19 cm/year) after 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exposures to dioxins and PCBs are associated with reduced growth during the peripubertal period and may compromise adult body mass, stature, and health. 
9366902	PC-1 and PC-2 are hypervariable mouse minisatellites. The rates of spontaneous germline-length mutation have been shown to vary between different mouse strains. PC-1 is composed of GGCAG repeat units and PC-2 of GGCAGGA. Minisatellites frequently mutate by gaining or losing repeat units. Such length mutations in mini- and microsatellites have been associated with human disease and may therefore be an important endpoint in genetic toxicity testing. Carcinogenic activity of many chemicals is associated with their ability to induce heritable mutations. Since minisatellites are highly prone to mutate to new lengths, which can be assayed by Southern analysis, we used this method to detect heritable genetic effects in mice. Male mice exposed to diesel exhausts and/or polychlorinted biphenyls (PCB) were investigated for effects on the germline mutation frequenallele lengths in parents and offspring. For PC-1 significantly higher mutation frequencies were found in males treated with diesel exhausts + PCB (6 of 35 alleles) and with PCB alone (6 of 51 alleles) as compared to the males in the control group (0 of 43 alleles). The mutation frequency in the diesel exhaust group was not significantly increased (2 of 43 alleles). For PC-2 the only mutation found occurred in the PCB group (1 of 51 alleles). This in vivo study demonstrates--for the first time--chemically induced minisatellite mutations in the germline.
1917803	The present study uses gas liquid chromatography (GLC) electron capture detection with packed and capillary columns to detect polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples from people living near the electric car repair and maintenance facility of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority in Paoli, Pennsylvania. Most of the cohort surveyed had serum patterns similar to patterns for Aroclor 1260 (AR 1260); a small portion (3/89) had patterns indicative of an AR with higher chlorination (e.g., AR 1268). In addition to analyzing serum samples from humans, we also analyzed serum samples from canines (pets of some of the subjects). In general, the serum pattern for canines was less descriptive for AR 1260 than the pattern for humans; however, the pattern for several canines (9/16) was that of the higher chlorinated PCBs (e.g., AR 1268). By using mass spectrometry and capillary column GLC, we confirmed the presence of high molecular weight polychlorinated congeners in both human and animal samples. We were not able to show a statistically significant relationship between serum patterns of PCBs in canines and their owners or between canines and certain behavioral traits (e.g., runs free, retrieves, hours outside, hours inside). However, the correlation between PCBs quantified as AR 1268 and canines' residence time was statistically significant.
9397600	The mean concentration of the chlorinated biphenyl 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) in plasma from 192 fishermen's wives from the Swedish east coast was on a fresh weight basis 960 (range 80-4300) pg/g and lipid adjusted 160 (range 20-780) ng/g lipid. The concentration of CB-153 in plasma was significantly influenced by age, total lactation time and place of living during childhood and adolescence (fishing village vs. other place). The residential variable probably reflects early life consumption of fish from the Baltic Sea (at the Swedish east coast) contaminated with persistent organochlorine compounds.
19479026	BACKGROUND: The University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study was undertaken to address concerns that the discharge of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzo furans (PCDFs) from the Dow Chemical Company in the Midland, Michigan, area had resulted in contamination of soils in the Tittabawassee River floodplain and the city of Midland, leading to an increase in residents' body burdens of these compounds. OBJECTIVE: In this article we present descriptive statistics from the resident survey and sampling of human serum, household dust, and soil and compare them with other published values. METHODS: From a multistage random sample of populations in four areas of Midland and Saginaw counties and from a distant referent population, we interviewed 946 adults, who also donated blood for analysis of PCDDs, PCDFs, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Samples of household dust and house perimeter soil were collected from consenting subjects who owned their property. RESULTS: All five study populations were comparable in age, race, sex, and length of residence in their current home. Regional differences existed in employment history, personal contact with contaminated soils, and consumption of fish and game from contaminated areas. Median soil concentrations were significantly increased around homes in the Tittabawassee River floodplain (11.4 ppt) and within the city of Midland (58.2 ppt) compared with the referent population (3.6 ppt). Median serum toxic equivalencies were significantly increased in people who lived in the floodplain (23.2 ppt) compared with the referent population (18.5 ppt). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in serum dioxin concentrations among the populations were small but statistically significant. Regression modeling is needed to identify whether the serum concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs are associated with contaminated soils, household dust, and other factors. 
18503055	BACKGROUND: Since fetal exposure to anti-androgenic and/or estrogenic compounds has adverse effect on animal reproduction, such exposure could be harmful to human fetus. Data are scarce on cryptorchidism and human exposure to endocrine disruptors. METHODS: We performed a prospective case-control study to assess the incidence of cryptorchidism and fetal exposure to selected chemicals in the Nice area. One hundred and fifty-one cord bloods (67 cryptorchid, 84 tightly matched controls) and 125 colostrums (56 for cryptorchid and 69 for controls) were screened for xenobiotics, including anti-androgenic dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dibutylphthalate (and metabolite monobutylphthalate, mBP). RESULTS: Median concentrations in colostrum were higher, although not statistically significantly, in cryptorchid versus controls. Cryptorchid boys were more likely to be classified in the most contaminated groups in colostrum for DDE, Sigma PCBs and the composite score PCB + DDE. The same trend, but again not statistically significantly was observed for mBP. Odds ratio for cryptorchidism was increased for the highest score of Sigma PCB, with a trend only for DDE and Sigma PCB + DDE versus the lowest score of those components. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support an association between congenital cryptorchidism and fetal exposure to PCBs and possibly DDE. Higher concentrations in milk could be a marker of higher exposure or for an impaired detoxification pattern in genetically predisposed individuals. 
19735942	Dietary habits that expose populations to potential toxicants as well as protective agents simultaneously are a realistic scenario where a meaningful assessment of the interactions and net benefit or damage can be made. A group of Inuit from Salluit, Northern Canada are exposed to high levels of PCBs and selenium, both present in the Inuit traditional foods such as blubber from sea mammals and fatty fish. Blood samples were collected from 83 Inuit, 22-70 years old. Blood selenium and PCB levels were determined previously and ranged from 227 to 2069µg/L and 1.7 to 143µg/L, respectively. DNA isolated from white blood cells were analyzed by modified (32)P-postlabeling adductomics technology that detects a multitude of highly polar to lipophilic adducts. The levels of 8-oxodG adducts ranged from 470 to 7400 adducts/10(9) nucleotides. Other as yet unidentified polar adducts showed a 30 to 800-fold inter-individual variability. Adduct levels were negatively associated with PCB and selenium levels. The subjects were classified into high and low ratio groups, with respect to selenium/PCB. In the high ratio group, the coefficient of selenium is significantly negatively correlated with 8-oxodG (r = -0.38, p = 0.014) and total adducts (r = -0.41, p = 0.009) while there was no correlation within the low selenium/PCB group. This study suggests that increasing selenium has mitigating effect in reducing DNA adducts and therefore, possible negative effects of PCB were not seen. A protective effect of selenium is highlighted.
21359368	Reports on residue levels and accumulation profiles of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in human adipose tissue are scarce in Korea. In this study, concentrations and accumulation features of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs were determined in the samples of adipose tissue collected from Korean women in 2007-2008. The total dioxin-like toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations (3.4-42 pg g(-1) lipid wt) in Korean adipose tissues were similar to those reported in European and other Asian countries. The relative contributions of individual compounds to total TEQs were as follows: non-ortho PCBs (mean: 45%) > PCDFs (28%) > PCDDs (24%) > mono-ortho PCBs (3%), a pattern similar to those reported for seafoods in Korea. The dominant PCDD/F congeners found in adipose tissues were OCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and dominant PCBs were 118, 156 and 105. No correlation was found between subject's age and concentrations of dioxin-like contaminants. Body mass index was not correlated with concentrations of PCDD/Fs and was negatively (p < 0.001) correlated with concentrations of DL-PCBs. The results of this study provide baseline information on PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in adipose tissues of the general population in Korea.
17250867	The effects of long-term exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on developmental dental defects of deciduous and permanent teeth in children in eastern Slovakia, where PCBs from a chemical plant manufacturing Delors contaminated the surrounding district were evaluated. Four hundred and thirtytwo children, lifelong residents, aged 8-9 years were examined. Children's caries susceptibility and gingival health was assessed by standard dental indices, and developmental enamel defects by the FDI index. Data from the PCBRISK project data set and questionnaires completed by the parents provided information on exposure and various confounding factors. The proportion of teeth with different types and extensions of developmental enamel defects correlated with serum PCB concentration. The proportion of deciduous teeth affected with enamel defects was significantly higher in higher exposed children (chi(2)=8.35; p=0.03) according to their serum PCB concentration (group 0: <200; group 1: 200-600; group 2: >600 ng PCBs g(-1) serum lipids). The proportion of permanent teeth affected with any enamel defect was significantly higher in higher exposed children (chi2=7.237; p=0.027). Furthermore, the extent of the enamel defects was also greater (chi2=10.714; p=0.005). In multivariate linear regression analysis PCB exposure was significantly related to developmental enamel defects of permanent teeth only. No associations between PCB exposure and caries susceptibility, gingival health or number of teeth were observed. This study demonstrated a dose-response relationship between PCB exposure and developmental enamel defects of permanent teeth in children, the evidence for deciduous teeth was not conclusive.
22790946	Six healthy male subjects were treated with 0 g, 1 g, 3 g, and 0 g of chitosan for the first, second, third, and fourth of four weeks, respectively. They were administered chitosan before breakfast on the second, third, and fourth days of the week, and fecal specimens were collected corresponding to the prescribed diet consumed for breakfast on the second day to breakfast on the fourth day. Fecal excretion of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was promoted by intake of 3 g of chitosan (p=0.0589 and p<0.05 respectively), and was positively correlated with that of fat (p<0.01 for both). We found that chitosan intake increased the fecal excretion of dioxins and PCBs, as well as that of fat, suggesting that it might be useful for reducing the adverse effects of lipophilic endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
3922318	The 95% prediction interval for single measurements of serum "Aroclor" reported by a reputable commercial analyst was found to be approximately +/- 42%. The geometric mean serum PCB levels in a population of capacitor workers who had formerly had direct exposure to the commercial PCBs--Aroclors 1016, 1242, and 1254-were found to be alternatively reportable as 1905 ppb minimum initial PCBs (as calculated from most persistent peaks present); 1093 ppb non-overlapping analytical "Aroclor" levels (as calculated by the conventional sum-of-the-peak-heights method); 303 ppb total PCBs actually present; or 19 ppb "human PCB" (as calculated by the NHMP procedure). The broad spread in reportable values was relatable to the PCB isomer distribution and clearance patterns in the occupationally exposed population.
23330224	To facilitate the assessment of adverse effects of very low concentrations of air pollutants on general populations, we planned to establish a reliable biomarker that is also useful in identifying vulnerable populations. For this purpose we monitored several inflammation markers in blood samples from 2 year old Japanese children (N = 30), and found that those children living close to major highways (<50 m) show higher levels of mRNA expression IL-22 in their blood samples than those living further away (+50 m). This tendency was more pronounced among subjects showing positive IgE against egg and milk. We further examined association between IL-22 mRNA expression and PCB residues and found a number of significant positive correlations between each individual PCB congener and IL-22 expression. To identify the most vulnerable population among those children we selected asthma as a typical allergy-related disease, and could show that there are significant differences in the levels of IL-22 mRNA expression between IgE negative non-asthmatic subject and asthmatic children showing positive IgE reaction toward egg or milk, again. These observations support our main conclusion that IL-22 expression is a sensitive biomarker which is useful in identifying sub-populations of children who are especially vulnerable to air pollution.
15091651	Concentrations of individual polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in blubber, liver, kidney and brain tissues of 10 male harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) of different ages. The animals were found dead or dying on the southern coast of Norway in 1988 during the morbilli virus epizootic. Twenty-three PCB congeners were investigated in all tissues by capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection and comparison with standards of the respective congeners (IUPAC numbers 28, 52, 74, 99, 101, 105, 110, 114, 118, 128, 138, 141, 149, 153, 156, 157, 170, 180, 183, 187, 194, 206 and 209). In addition, three toxic coplanar congeners (IUPAC numbers 77, 126 and 169) were investigated in the blubber samples. Total PCB (sum of the determined congeners) in kidney (12-60 nmol g(-1)), liver (12-90 nmol g(-1)) and blubber (10-79 nmol g(-1)) were similar on extractable lipid basis, while total PCB in brain lipid was about 1/10 (1.6-12 nmol g(-1)). The absolute concentrations of the individual congeners in brain lipid correlated poorly with the respective concentrations in each of the other tissues, while the individual congener concentrations in the lipid fractions of kidney, liver and blubber tended to correlate with each other. The relative concentrations of the sum of the most persistent congeners (PCB-99, -128, -138, -153, -170, -180, -187 and -194) correlated in all tissues, and an increase of the relative concentrations of these congeners, most distinct in blubber, with higher carcass weight, was shown. Also, total PCB in blubber correlated with carcass weight. When comparing the relative concentration patterns of individual congeners (per cent of total) in the four tissues, six congeners differed significantly between tissues, and the relative brain concentrations showed most deviation from the other tissues. The concentration of the coplanar PCBs was 1 : 1000-1 : 1000 of the total PCB concentration. The results demonstrate a lower accumulation together with a different concentration pattern in the brain as compared to other tissues.
18474391	We measured the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (non-ortho PCBs), and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (mono-ortho PCBs) in paired samples of blood and breast milk collected from 60 mothers in Sapporo City, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The present study is one of the few studies in which PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs have been measured in blood and breast milk collected from 60 same mothers. Of these 60 mothers, 30 were primipara (mean: 30.1 years, median: 28.0 years) and 30 were multipara (mean: 32.2 years, median: 32.5 years). The arithmetic mean TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of the primiparous mothers were 9.0, 3.3, 5.7, and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively, and 5.2, 2.2, 4.5, and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively, with the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds being 9.3-42.9 (mean: 18.4, median: 17.3) and 7.0-41.1 (mean: 12.3, median: 11.4) pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively. In the case of multiparous mothers, the arithmetic mean TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds in blood and breast milk were 7.1, 2.7, 5.3, and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively, and 3.9, 1.7, 3.8, and 0.4 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively, with the total TEQ concentrations being 3.4-28.1 (mean: 15.5, median: 13.9) and 2.7-20.0 (mean: 9.8, median: 9.2)pg TEQ g(-1) lipid, respectively. The total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk of primiparous mothers in Sapporo City appeared to be generally lower than those recently surveyed throughout the greater area of Japan. Significant correlations were observed between age and the total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in the blood of primiparae and multiparae, and significant correlations were also observed between age and the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds in the breast milk of primiparae and multiparae. The total TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of primiparous mothers showed a close correlation to those in their breast milk and also showed good correlations between the total TEQ concentrations of these dioxin-like compounds in the blood of multiparous mothers and those in their breast milk. The result of a comparison of the arithmetic mean concentrations of each congener of PCDDs, PCDFs, non-ortho PCBs, and mono-ortho PCBs in blood and breast milk indicated that the transfer of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) from the blood to the breast milk was lower than those of other congeners. In contrast, among mono-ortho PCBs congeners, the arithmetic mean concentrations of 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PentaCB) (#118) and 2,3,3',4,4'-PentaCB (#105) in the breast milk were slightly higher than those in the blood, which suggested that breast-fed infants may be at higher risk from mono-ortho PCBs.
15331262	To assess the influence of a new hazardous waste incinerator (HWI) on public health, a preoperational monitoring program was established during the period of construction. In this study, the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF) accumulated in adipose tissue of 15 autopsied subjects living in the area under potential impact of the HWI were determined after approximately 3 years of regular operations in the facility. The non-ortho PCBs 77, 126 and 169 were also determined. PCDD/F concentrations ranged between 1.5 and 41 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat (2.4 and 72 WHO-TEQ/g fat, respectively, including PCBs), with a mean value of 11 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat and a median value of 7.4 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat (22 and 13 WHO-TEQ/g fat, respectively, including PCBs). In the baseline study, the mean level of PCDD/Fs was 36 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat (61 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat, including non-ortho PCBs 77, 126 and 169), which means a reduction of 70% (64% including PCBs). This notable reduction is in accordance with the important decrease observed in recent years in PCDD/F intake through the diet. The current concentrations of PCDD/Fs in human adipose tissue, as well as recent data on PCDD/F levels in plasma and breast milk of subjects living in the vicinity of the same HWI, indicate that there is not any additional significant exposure to PCDD/Fs for this population.
9599454	This study reports the concentration levels of PCB, DDT, HCB and beta-HCH in the human milk of women living in northern Germany over a period of 12 years and determines factors that may influence these levels. From 1986 to 1997 more than 3500 milk samples were analyzed for organochlorine compounds. A questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding personal characteristics, life style factors and eating habits. Descriptive statistics of concentration levels were computed to characterize the current extent of contamination. To follow time trends across the years homogeneous subgroups were compared and multiple regression analyses were used to investigate associations between determining factors and specific contaminants. Between summer 1995 and summer 1997 the median PCB concentration level was 0.502 mg/kg, the median DDT level 0.202 mg/kg, the median HCB level 0.065 mg/kg and the median beta-HCH level 0.036 mg/kg, all values expressed on a fat basis. The median concentration levels decreased by 80-90% during the past 12 years and the median PCB levels by 60%. The concentration levels of all substances were positively correlated with maternal age and negatively associated to parity, to the total period of breast-feeding and to a weight increase of mothers before and after delivery. Post-pregnancy BMI was a significant predictor of the likelihood of having higher concentrations for DDT, HCB and beta-HCH and of having lower concentrations for PCB levels. A balanced diet for at least 3 years was related to lower HCB and beta-HCH levels. Women who ate more than 100 g of fish or more than 700 g of meat per week were more likely to have higher PCB and beta-HCH levels or higher HCB levels, respectively. Higher HCB and beta-HCH concentration levels were associated with lower birth weights of female infants.
18834980	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may interact with several thyroid functions. Severe environmental pollution by PCBs has been observed in Brescia, Italy, due to the presence of a factory that produced these compounds until 1984. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the correlation between serum levels of total PCBs and PCB 153 and thyroid hormone serum levels in adults in a cross-sectional population-based study. METHODS: A total of 527 subjects were enrolled; they were face-to-face interviewed about their history of thyroid disease and provided a blood sample under fasting conditions. The serum levels of free and total triiodothyronine (FT3 and TT3), thyroxine (FT4 and TT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TGA), and lipid-adjusted total PCBs and PCB 153 were determined. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in total PCB and PCB 153 concentrations in subjects with and without thyroid disease. Inverse, weak, statistically significant correlations were found between total PCBs and FT3 (Spearman's r=-0.09) and between total PCBs and PCB 153 and TSH (Spearman's r=-0.16 and -0.12, respectively). However, multiple regression analysis with FT3 and TSH serum levels as dependent variables and total PCBs and PCB 153 serum levels as predictors, including age, gender and BMI, showed a positive, rather than negative, association of PCBs and PCB 153 with FT3 and no association with TSH. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that relatively high PCB environmental exposure can determine substantial alterations in thyroid function among adult people. 
19773016	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures are encountered by the general public by eating contaminated food or living near a previously operating PCB factory or hazardous waste site. PCBs affect the immune, reproductive, nervous, and endocrine systems and are carcinogens. PCBs were banned in the United States in 1977. For public health, it is important to be able to estimate individual risk, especially for vulnerable populations, to monitor the decline in risk over time and to alert the public health community if spikes occur in PCB exposures, by measuring serum PCB levels. The historical decline in PCB exposures cannot be documented within a repeatedly tested general population, since there is no such population. Therefore, our aim was to model serum PCB levels in the US general population over time using published data. METHODS: Models were developed based on 45 publications providing 16,914 background PCB levels in sera collected 1963-2003. Multiple linear regression and exponential decay were used to model the summary PCB levels. RESULTS: Background levels of higher-chlorinated PCBs (five or more chlorines) in sera increased before 1979 and decreased after 1979; a quadratic model was the best fit. However, the exponential decay model explained better the low PCB serum levels still seen in the general population. For lower-chlorinated serum PCBs, no increase or decrease was shown (1.7ppb for all years). CONCLUSIONS: Limitations for both models were lack of repeated measures, non-randomly selected study participants, selected years, concentration on geographic areas centered on PCB waste sites, lack of adjustment for BMI or for laboratory methods. Despite the limitations, this analysis shows that background PCB levels in the general population are still of concern. Future work should focus on uncertainties governing how to interpret the levels with respect to possible long term health effects. 
15205043	Pregnant does (10 goats/group) were dosed orally with either PCB 153 or PCB 126 dissolved in corn oil or only corn oil (control group) from day 60 of gestation until delivery. Effects on in vitro mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and blood cell counts in their goat kids exposed to low levels of PCB 153 and PCB 126 during gestation and lactation were assessed. The concentrations of PCB 153 and PCB 126 in adipose tissue in the goat kids 9 mo postpartum were 5800 ng/g (fat weight) and 0.49 ng/g (fat weight), respectively. Kids exposed to PCB 153 had a significantly higher number of white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes at 2 wk of age compared to controls. In the kids exposed to PCB 126 there was a significantly lower concentration of monocytes at 2, 4, and 8 wk of age. The mean lymphocyte response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and to concanavalin A (Con A) was significant lower in the PCB 153 compared to the control group at wk 2, 4, and 8 postnatally. The results of the present study support previous reports on immunotoxic effects of PCB exposure in animals. However, this is the first report to demonstrate immunotoxicity in animals by using low doses of PCB 153. The difference in results between PCB 126 and PCB 153 treatment groups may strengthen the hypothesis that PCBs mediate immunotoxic effects through both AhR-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
6785463	The geometric mean serum level of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) of 458 persons in a communitywide study was 17.2 microgram/L, with 80% to 90% having levels within the range found in other community groups. As a dependent variable, PCB levels were found to be positively related to age, even when controlled for all other variables associated with PCB level: sex, local fish consumption, obesity, serum cholesterol level, and alcohol consumption. No major point source of PCB contamination was found, and fish taken in the drainage of a major population center had mean PCB levels below the current enforceable Food and Drug Administration tolerance of 5 mg/kg. As an independent variable, serum PCB levels were positively associated with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level, serum cholesterol level, and measured blood pressure. The PCB-blood pressure association, which was independent of age, sex, body mass index, and social class, must be confirmed in other exposed populations.
9451808	Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most toxic environmental pollutants. We determined blood levels of these compounds in a population sample of the city of Mataró, Spain. Blood samples were drawn from a randomly selected sample of 198 subjects, of both genders, aged 18 to 69 years. These samples were pooled into 10 groups for laboratory analysis. For males, total level of PCDDs was 505.7 ppt, of PCDFs was 26.7 ppt, and the international toxic equivalent (I-TEQ) was 12.5. For females the levels were 739 ppt, 28.8 ppt and 14.71-TEQ, respectively. The most important contributors to the total I-TEQ were HexaCDD, PentaCDD and PentaCDF. The blood concentration of total PCBs was 2.02 mg/l in males, and 1.58 mg/l in females. Levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs increased by age in both sexes. The levels of PCDDs and PCDFs in residents of this Mediterranean city are among the lowest observed in industrialized countries.
9828309	This paper presents measured dioxin, dibenzofuran, PCB, DDE and HCB blood and milk levels and estimated body burdens in a mother who nursed twins for thirty-eight months. A total of thirteen milk samples and three blood samples were collected and analyzed. Measured PCDD and PCDF levels in milk decreased from 309 and 21 ng/kg (ppt) to 173 and 9 ng/kg, respectively, between March 1993 and September 1995. Based on the decrease in breast milk dioxin levels, we estimate that the nursing mother reduced her dioxin body burden from 310 to 96 ng dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs), or approximately 69%. In two and one half years the level of HCB in the mother's milk decreased from 10.7 to less than 1.8 ng/g (ppb), the level of DDE decreased from 246 to 46 ng/g and the total level of non-coplanar PCBs decreased from 285 to 63 ng/g, on a lipid basis. We estimate that the twin's consumption of dioxins, dibenzofurans, and coplanar PCBs from breast feeding was approximately 115 ng TEQ per twin.
20533551	A number of epidemiologic studies have suggested that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and other organochlorine compounds (OCC) increase risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). However, these studies have generally had no biologic measure of OCC exposure, and have been unable to control for sun exposure, the major known environmental risk factor for this disease. This preliminary study examined the relationship between OCC residues in plasma and risk of CMM adjusting for sun sensitivity and sun exposure. A case-control study of 80 CMM patients and 310 control subjects was conducted. Lifetime sun exposure information, along with data on pigmentation variables and sun sensitivity data was collected, along with a blood sample. Cases and controls were assayed for plasma levels of 14 PCB congeners and 11 organochlorine pesticide residues using gas chromatography. Strong associations were seen between risk of CMM and plasma levels of non-dioxin-like PCBs (Adjusted OR = 7.02; 95% CI: 2.30-21.43 for highest quartile) and several PCB congeners, organochlorine pesticides or metabolites. These associations persisted after control for sun sensitivity and sun exposure. Results from this investigation require independent confirmation in larger studies. However, they suggest that environmental factors other than UV radiation may play a role in genesis of CMM, and indicate that it may be productive to search for further agents which might increase risk.
10642111	We examined the relationship between prenatal (cord blood) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) performance in babies born to women who consumed contaminated Lake Ontario fish. Cord blood PCBs, DDE, HCB, Mirex, lead, and hair mercury levels were determined for 152 women who reported never consuming Lake Ontario fish and 141 women who reported consuming at least 40 PCB-equivalent lbs. of Lake Ontario fish over their lifetime. Earlier work demonstrated that the newborns of fish eaters are exposed to a more heavily chlorinated distribution of PCB congeners, and that highly chlorinated PCBs (hepta-, octa-, and nonachlorinated biphenyls) are most strongly correlated with breast milk levels, perhaps providing the best index of PCB exposure in the Oswego cohort. Given the above, one would predict that these PCBs would be related to impaired performance on those NBAS clusters associated with fish consumption: namely Habituation, Autonomic, and Reflex clusters of the NBAS. Excepting the Relex cluster, these predictions were confirmed. Results revealed significant linear relationships between the most heavily chlorinated PCBs and performance impairments on the Habituation and Autonomic clusters of the NBAS at 25-48 h after birth. Additionally, higher prenatal PCB exposure was associated with a nonspecific performance impairment on the NBAS as evidenced by a significantly greater proportion of NBAS scales in which poor performance was exhibited (more than 1 standard deviation below the mean) in the most highly exposed neonates. Moreover, PCBs of lighter chlorination were unrelated to NBAS performance, as were DDE, Mirex, HCB, lead, and mercury. These results corroborate our earlier findings linking Lake Ontario fish consumption to the most heavily chlorinated PCB congeners, and suggest that the chlorination and persistence of PCBs may be an important factor both for exposure assessment and for determining relationships with neurobehavioral functions.
20559629	This study was conducted to assess the health of a subtidal marine sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius, naturally exposed in a shipping terminal where polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) had been spilled, as well as that of others sculpins after decontamination in the laboratory for 16 weeks. Reference samples were captured at a pristine site upcurrent from the contaminated terminal. Examination of field samples caught by scuba divers showed external and toxicopathic lesions in several tissues; decreased body condition and organ indices; and decreased hemoglobin and lymphocyte levels. No difference in the diversity of parasites was observed between reference and contaminated samples, but abundance was generally greater in fish from the latter site. Although the total number of species of parasites decreased in both groups of depurated sculpins, the abundance of infections on gill and gall bladder was significantly greater in fish from the polluted site. These results suggest that M. scorpius was affected adversely by PCBs and that its responses are ecologically significant as a bioindicator species in degraded habitats. Moreover, remediation might not mitigate the observed anomalies in fish inhabiting the impacted site.
19184731	Short-term stress exposure is associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and a consequent rise in blood glucocorticoids and catecholamines, from the adrenal cortex and medulla, respectively. The HPA axis is a potential target for some persistent organic pollutants, among which polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were found to be modulators of the mammalian endocrine system. PCB are distributed globally in the environment, in food chains, and are transferred to the fetuses of pregnant animals and via mother's milk to suckling offspring. In the present study it was postulated that intrauterine and lactational exposure to either of two single congeners of PCB (PCB 153 and PCB 126, respectively) might affect basal cortisol concentrations, and also the cortisol response to short-term stress in adulthood. Thus, pregnant goats were orally exposed to one of these PCB congeners from d 60 of gestation until delivery, and their offspring studied. Low-dose exposure to PCB 153 and PCB 126 resulted in significantly lower mean basal cortisol concentrations in goat offspring during certain periods of pubertal development and their first breeding season. Male goat kids exposed to either PCB congener showed a greater and more prolonged rise in plasma cortisol levels than controls when animals were subjected to mild stress at 9 mo of age using frequent blood sampling. Neither the basal maternal cortisol plasma level nor goat kid adrenal masses were affected by PCB exposure.
22546635	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) have in epidemiological studies been associated with health hazards. The exposure window might be crucial and it is, accordingly, important to analyze exposure concentrations in samples collected at the window of interest. This makes the use of stored blood samples extremely interesting. However, small blood volumes from stored samples in biobanks means that the researchers in epidemiological studies most often have to select a limited number of biomarkers representing the POP exposure and abstain from analyses of lipid concentrations. This raises the question of the necessity of lipid adjustment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between fresh weight and lipid adjusted concentrations. METHODS: We included data from studies were we have used the PCB congener 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) as a biomarker for POP exposure and where fresh weight as well as lipid adjusted PCB-153 concentrations are known (n=1628). The variety of the cohort members in the different studies gave us the possibility to better understand how well these measures correlate. RESULTS: When all individuals were included in the analyses a correlation coefficient of 0.95 between fresh weight and lipid adjusted serum concentrations was obtained. Restricting the analyses to specific subgroups (based on gender, fasting status, age and BMI) gave correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: This study does strongly support the use of samples from biobanks in epidemiological studies for analyzing PCBs, at least regarding PCB-153, even though it is not possible to lipid adjust the results. 
11732699	The purpose of this study was to assess the association between 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) in plasma, a biomarker of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and time to pregnancy (TTP) in a group of women with a varying dietary exposure to PCB. For 121 Swedish east coast fishermen's wives (median year of birth 1956, range 1945-1968), information on selt-reported TTP for the first planned pregnancy (median 2 mo, range 0-48) and CB-153 concentrations from blood samples drawn in 1995 (median 144 ng/g lipid, range 16-566) were available. Each woman's CB-153 concentration in plasma at the time immediately preceding her pregnancy was estimated, taking into account reduction of body burden of CB-153 due to lactation, the yearly reduction of PCB in Baltic Sea fish, as well as the biological half-life of CB-153. Based on the estimated CB-153 concentrations, subjects were categorized into tertiles as low (37-206 ng/g lipid), medium (207-330 ng/g lipid), and high (331-,1036 ng/g lipid) exposure groups. TTP in the medium- and high-exposure groups were then compared to TTP in the low-exposure group by estimating the corresponding success rate (i.e., the number of pregnancies per person month) ratios (SuRR) using discrete Cox regression, taking into account essential confounders. No obvious association between estimated CB-153 concentration and TTP was observed (medium vs. low: SuRR 0.77 [95% CI 0.47-1.28] and high vs. low: SuRR 0.95 10.74-1.23]). The present data give no support for a negative association between the plasma CB-153 concentrations observed in the present study and TTP. It should, however, be borne in mind that the study group was rather small and mainly included relatively young women, likely to have been only moderately exposed.
23555630	Adverse effects of prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners on postnatal brain development have been reported in a number of previous studies. However, few studies have examined the effects of prenatal PCB exposure on early social development. The present study sought to increase understanding of the neurotoxicity of PCBs by examining the relationship between PCB congener concentrations in umbilical cord blood and fixation patterns when observing upright and inverted biological motion (BM) at four-months after birth. The development of the ability to recognize BM stimuli is considered a hallmark of socio-cognitive development. The results revealed a link between dioxin-like PCB #118 concentration and fixation pattern. Specifically, four-month-olds with a low-level of prenatal exposure to PCB #118 exhibited a preference for the upright BM over inverted BM, whereas those with a relatively high-level of exposure did not. This finding supports the proposal that prenatal PCB exposure impairs the development of social functioning, and indicates the importance of congener-specific analysis in the risk analysis of the adverse effects of PCB exposure on the brain development.
1433761	OBJECTIVE: To compare the cognitive development in Taiwanese children who had been exposed prenatally to high levels of heat-degraded polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with control children who were exposed to background levels. The disorder was called Yu-Cheng, "oil disease," in Taiwan. DESIGN: Matched-pair cohort study. SETTING: Communities in central Taiwan in which there had been a cooking-oil contamination and mass poisoning by heat-degraded PCBs in 1978 through 1979. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen children born between June 1978 and March 1985 during or after their mothers' consumption of contaminated rice oil; 118 children matched for age, sex, neighborhood, maternal age, and parental education and occupational class; and 15 older siblings of exposed children, born before the poisoning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive development measured from 1985 through 1990 using the Chinese versions of the Stanford-Binet test and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Revised, RESULTS: The exposed children scored approximately 5 points lower on the Stanford-Binet test at the ages of 4 and 5 years and approximately 5 points lower on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Revised, at the ages of 6 and 7 years. Children born up to 6 years after their mothers' exposure were as affected as children born within a year or two after exposure when examined at 6 and 7 years of age. Older siblings resembled the control children. CONCLUSION: Children prenatally exposed to heat-degraded PCBs had poorer cognitive development than their matched controls. The effect persisted in the children up to the age of 7 years, and children born long after the exposure were still affected. 
3105611	The urinary levels of estrone sulfate and 11-ketotetranor prostaglandin F metabolite (11-ketotetranor PGF metabolite) during gestation in guinea pigs were measured by radioimmunoassays. Vehicle and Clophen A50 (polychlorinated biphenyls)-treated animals were compared. Gestation was arbitrarily divided into four periods, and the mean hormone levels during each period were compared between the two treatment groups. The Clophen A50 treatment (100 mg total, during Days 16-60), which causes fetal death, was correlated to significantly higher levels of estrone sulfate (p less than 0.05) and 11-ketotetranor PGF metabolite (p less than 0.01) during Days 47-60 (Period IV) of gestation.
6804611	Effects of dietary level of sulfur-containing amino acids (S-AA) on liver drug-metabolizing enzymes, serum cholesterol and ascorbic acid metabolism in growing rats fed diets containing 300 ppm of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were investigated. Maximum gain in body weight was observed with 0.5% S-AA diets with or without PCB addition. Metabolic parameters increased by PCB were liver weight, activities of hepatic aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase, serum total cholesterol, serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum corticosterone and urinary metabolites of the glucuronic acid pathway including ascorbic acid, glucuronic acid and glucaric acid. In the PCB-treated animals, maximum values of liver weight, aminopyrine demethylase activity, serum cholesterol, serum corticosterone, urinary ascorbic acid and glucaric acid were obtained with about 0.8% S-AA. For the maximum induction of these metabolic responses, 0.5% S-AA was not enough. Urinary glucuronic acid and the ratio of lower density lipoprotein cholesterol versus high density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased with a supplement of S-AA to PCB-containing diets.
17365584	We evaluated the impact of two iron and steel plants and two municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI) in Wallonia (Belgium) on the exposure of residents to dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals. In total, 142 volunteers living around these facilities were recruited and compared with 63 referents from a rural area with no industrial source of pollution. Information about smoking habits, dietary habits, anthropometric characteristics, residential history, and health status was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. The volunteers provided blood under fasting conditions in order to evaluate the body burden of dioxins (17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans [PCDD/Fs] congeners) and PCBs. Samples of blood and urine were also taken for the determination of cadmium, mercury, and lead. After adjustment for covariates, concentrations of cadmium, mercury, and lead in urine or blood were not increased in subjects living in the vicinity of MSWIs or sinter plants by comparison with referents. Residents around the sinter plants and the MSWI located in the industrial area had concentrations of dioxins and PCBs in serum similar to that of referents. By contrast, subjects living in the vicinity of the MSWI in the rural area showed significantly higher serum levels of dioxins (geometric mean, 38 vs. 24 pg TEQ/g fat) and coplanar PCBs (geometric mean, 10.8 vs. 7.0 pg TEQ/g fat). Although age-adjusted dioxin levels in referents did not vary with local animal fat consumption, concentrations of dioxins in subjects living around the incinerators correlated positively with their intake of local animal fat, with almost a doubling in subjects with the highest fat intake. These results indicate that dioxins and coplanar PCBs emitted by MSWIs can indeed accumulate in the body of residents who regularly consume animal products of local origin.
9358917	Specific congeners of PCBs may differ with respect to their human health risks. For epidemiologic studies, however, measuring levels of specific congeners--as compared with estimating the concentration of total PCBs present, may be of limited value if levels of specific congeners are highly correlated. We examined the correlations among levels of specific congeners in three groups: controls from a case-control study of breast cancer in North Carolina and two groups from Wisconsin with exposure to fish from contaminated waters. Levels of specific congeners were, in general, highly correlated (Pearson r > 0.80). However, the level of congener 180, a heptachlorobiphenyl, tended to be less correlated with levels of lower-chlorinated biphenyls. Among the implications of these findings are that measurement of a select group of congeners may yield essentially the same information as measurement of a large panel, and may be more cost efficient.
12519720	The adverse effects of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on human health are of increasing concern. These lipophilic compounds are concentrated through the food chain and are present in human milk. This study compares PCB levels in human milk samples from Hong Kong and Dutch mothers. Ten breast milk samples from Hong Kong and 10 from the Netherlands were collected during home visits between 2 and 6 weeks postpartum. Total toxic equivalence (TEQ) of dioxin and PCBs were determined using the DR-CALUX(R) bioassay. The total dioxin and PCB levels in breast milk samples for Hong Kong ranged from 3.1 to 29.9 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid and for the Netherlands from 8.9 to 89.5 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid. Despite Hong Kong's high degree of industrialization, the levels of dioxin and PCBs were fourfold lower in the Hong Kong than in the Dutch samples. This may be due to a lower dietary intake of dioxins and PCBs in Hong Kong because of lower background levels of these contaminants or to different food habits.
20019911	BACKGROUND: Although sources and routes of exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been studied, information regarding exposure among children is limited. Breast-feeding and diet are two important contributors to early life exposure. To further understand other significant contributors to childhood exposure, we studied a cohort of children from a city with high environmental dioxin levels. OBJECTIVES: We investigated predictors of serum concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs)/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)/co-planar PCBs (C-PCBs), toxic equivalents (TEQs), and PCBs among 8- to 9-year-old boys in Chapaevsk, Russia. METHODS: We used general linear regression models to explore associations of log(10)-transformed serum concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs/C-PCBs, TEQs, and PCBs at study entry with anthropometric, demographic, geographic, and dietary factors in 482 boys in Chapaevsk, Russia. RESULTS: The median (25th, 75th percentile) concentration for total 2005 TEQs was 21.1 pg/g lipid (14.4, 33.2). Boys who were older, consumed local foods, were breast-fed longer, and whose mothers were employed at the Khimprom chemical plant (where chlorinated chemicals were produced) or gardened locally had significantly higher serum dioxins and PCBs, whereas boys with higher body mass index or more educated parents had significantly lower serum dioxins and PCBs. Boys who lived < 2 km from Khimprom had higher total TEQs (picograms per gram lipid) [adjusted mean = 30.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 26.8-35.0] than boys who lived > 5 km away (adjusted mean = 18.8; 95% CI, 17.2-20.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there are specific local sources of dioxin and PCB exposure among children in Chapaevsk including maternal gardening, consumption of locally grown food, and residential proximity to the Khimprom plant. 
23134768	Because fetuses are considered significantly more sensitive to various environment toxicants, there is a need for continuous biomonitoring of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs (DL-PCBs) to assess their impact on this susceptible population. The aim of this study was to assess the concentration of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in placenta samples from women participating in the Spanish Environment and Childhood (INMA) birth cohort study and to evaluate whether maternal and child characteristics predict placenta concentrations of these pollutants. The presence of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs was investigated in 50 placenta samples selected at random in the recruitment period 2000-2008. Multivariable regression models were constructed. Mothers had a mean age at delivery of 30.7 years (18.0-38.0 years), pre-pregnancy BMI of 23.3 kg/m² (18.0-40.2 kg/m²), and 31% were smokers. Median total concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs were 6.9 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid and 2.1 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid, respectively. In comparison to the few previous studies in placenta, total TEQ levels were among the lowest recorded in comparable general populations. The congener distribution pattern and the frequencies and concentrations of PCDD/F and DL-PCB congeners were similar to previous reports in placenta. PCDD/F and DL-PCB exposure was related to the age of the mother and the year of the delivery. Although placental concentrations cannot be considered wholly appropriate predictors for evaluating fetal exposure to these contaminants, they can provide a good indication of both maternal and infant prenatal and postnatal exposure and can be used as a proxy for fetal exposure.
10912246	Global contamination by a variety of anthropogenic persistent organic chemicals, such as dioxins and PCBs, has resulted in human exposure throughout all phases of development. Detectable concentrations of PCBs and dioxins have been found in amniotic fluid, placenta and foetal tissue samples while infants who are breast-fed can obtain blood levels greater than those of their mother's. In two separate food poisoning episodes where infants were exposed in utero to elevated levels of heat-degraded PCBs (PCBs, PCQs, PCDFs), a variety of adverse mental and physical developmental abnormalities have been observed. In additional human cohorts where exposure could be considered as environmental or background, more subtle effects, including lower birth weights, alterations in thyroid hormones and lymphocyte subpopulations and detriments in neurological development, have been consistently seen. In most instances, negative associations were made between in utero exposure to contaminants compared with lactational. Although the observed neurodevelopmental deficits have been described as subtle, there could be unknown consequences related to future intellectual functionality. Current regulatory efforts should focus on identification and control of environment and food chain contamination as in utero exposure is a direct consequence of the accumulated maternal body burdens.
18718897	In a selected group of women from the Danish National Birth Cohort, the authors investigated the association between intake of fatty fish and plasma concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the one hand and the association between maternal PCB concentrations and fetal growth on the other. Of 70,183 women who filled in a food frequency questionnaire during 1996-2002, 100 nulliparous women aged 25-35 years with normal prepregnancy body mass index were selected according to their intake of fatty fish (low (0 meals/month, n = 34), medium (1-3 meals/month, n = 33), or high (> or = meals/month, n = 33)). Women with a high intake of fatty fish had 50% (95% confidence interval (CI): 31, 72) higher plasma PCB concentrations than women with low intake. Maternal plasma PCB concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight and placental weight. The adjusted mean difference between the 75th and 25th PCB percentiles was -155 g (95% CI: -291, -19) for birth weight and -81 g (95% CI: -135, -26) for placental weight. These results support previous findings from this cohort, where fatty fish intake was inversely associated with fetal growth. Dietary recommendations often encourage weekly consumption of fatty fish. These results suggest that potential exposure to PCBs should be carefully considered before recommending such intakes among women of childbearing age.
10092417	Great Lakes (GL) sport fish consumption is a potential human exposure route for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE). Because of fish tissue contamination, frequent consumers of Great Lakes sport caught fish (GLSCF) may be at risk for PCB and DDE accumulation. To examine this problem, the Health Departments of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan formed a health assessment consortium. Participants were contacted by telephone to complete a detailed demographic and fish consumption survey. Frequent and infrequent GLSCF consumers were identified, and a participant subset was then asked to donate blood for PCB and DDE analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to study exposure group mean differences, while correlation and regression analyses were performed to examine relationships between demographic characteristics, GLSCF consumption, PCB, and DDE body burdens. A total of 4206 individuals participated in the study. Of these, 2542 were habitual GLSCF consumers (mean greater than 35 meals/year males; greater than 27 meals/year females), while 1664 did not eat GLSCF. A subset of 538 participants donated blood and included 439 frequent and 99 infrequent GLSCF consumers. PCB levels were significantly higher in the group of GLSCF consumers (geometric mean: 4.8 ppb males, 2.1 ppb females) when compared to their referents (geometric mean: 1.5 ppb males, 0.9 ppb females), while DDE levels were also higher for GLSCF consumers. PCB and DDE body burdens varied by exposure group, gender, and great lake (Michigan, Huron, Erie). PCB and DDE levels were significantly correlated to age, body mass index, and sport fish and Great Lakes sport fish consumption histories. Regression analysis identified years of consuming sport caught fish as the most robust predictor of PCBs (r2=25%), while age was the best predictor of DDE levels (r2=21%). This study corroborated previous findings relating frequent GLSCF consumption to a higher body burden for PCBs and DDE.
20176133	Arctic seabirds are exposed to a wide range of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs). Exposure occurs mainly through food intake, and many pollutants accumulate in lipid-rich tissues. Little is known about how HOCs are biotransformed in arctic seabirds. In this study, we characterized biotransformation enzymes in chicks of northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) from Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Norway). Phase I and II enzymes were analyzed at the transcriptional, translational and activity levels. For gene expression patterns, quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR), using gene-sequence primers, were performed. Protein levels were analyzed using immunochemical assays of western blot with commercially available antibodies. Liver samples were analyzed for phase I and II enzyme activities using a variety of substrates including ethoxyresorufin (cytochrome (CYP)1A1/1A2), pentoxyresorufin (CYP2B), methoxyresorufin (CYP1A), benzyloxyresorufin (CYP3A), testosterone (CYP3A/CYP2B), 1-chloro-2,4-nitrobenzene (CDNB) (glutathione S-transferase (GST)) and 4-nitrophenol (uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT)). In addition, the hydroxylated (OH-) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were analyzed in the blood, liver and brain tissue, whereas the methylsulfone (MeSO(2)-) PCBs were analyzed in liver tissue. Results indicated the presence of phase I (CYP1A4/CYP1A5, CYP2B, and CYP3A) and phase II (GST and UDPGT) enzymes at the activity, protein and/or mRNA level in both species. Northern fulmar chicks had higher enzyme activity than black-legged kittiwake chicks. This in combination with the higher SigmaOH-PCB to parent PCB ratios suggests that northern fulmar chicks have a different biotransformation capacity than black-legged kittiwake chicks.
19560797	A gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) clean-up based method was developed for determination of selected organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in human serum. The method permits automation of the sample extract clean-up stage and is designed to work with small amounts of sample. Different working variables were studied in its development, including injection volume, flow rate, and fat amount as the most representative coextract. The method provides solvent and time savings. Initial extraction was performed using 96-well solid-phase disk extraction plates, and quantification was performed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection and mass spectrometry. Recoveries of PCB congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180 and organochlorine pesticides HCB, beta-HCH, gamma-HCH, heptachlor epoxide, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT at two spiking levels ranged from 55% to 115% with relative standard deviations ranging from 2.0% to 14.6%. Limits of quantification ranged from 0.06 to 0.16 ng mL(-1) for PCBs and from 0.12 to 0.36 ng mL(-1) for organochlorine pesticides. Finally, the method was applied to the analysis of 38 serum samples and the results were compared with those of another procedure validated at the laboratory.
19590698	BACKGROUND: Incidence of childhood leukemia in industrialized countries rose significantly during 1975-2004, and the reasons for the increase are not understood. OBJECTIVES: We used carpet dust as an exposure indicator to examine the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to residential exposure to persistent organochlorine chemicals: six polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and the pesticides alpha- and gamma-chlordane, p,p'-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), p,p'-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), methoxychlor, and pentachlorophenol. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study in 35 counties in northern and central California in 2001-2006. The study included 184 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases 0-7 years of age and 212 birth certificate controls matched to cases by birth date, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. We collected carpet dust samples from the room where the child spent the most time before diagnosis (similar date for controls) using a specialized vacuum. RESULTS: Detection of any PCB congener in the dust conferred a 2-fold increased risk of ALL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-3.17]. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of total PCBs, the highest quartile was associated with about a 3-fold risk (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.41-5.48), and the positive trend was significant (p = 0.017). Significant positive trends in ALL risk were apparent with increasing concentrations of PCB congeners 118, 138, and 153. We observed no significant positive associations for chlordane, DDT, DDE, methoxychlor, or pentachlorophenol. The associations with PCBs were stronger among non-Hispanic whites than among Hispanics despite similar distributions of PCB levels among controls in each racial/ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PCBs, which are considered probable human carcinogens and cause perturbations of the immune system, may represent a previously unrecognized risk factor for childhood leukemia. 
10699571	The effects of nine methylsulfonyl (MeSO(2)) metabolites of tetra-, penta- and hexachlorinated biphenyls (tetra-, penta- and hexaCBs; 20 micromol/kg once daily for 4 days) on the hepatic microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT) were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Each of the seven 3-MeSO(2)-PCBs, 3-MeSO(2)-2, 2',4',5-tetraCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB49), 3-MeSO(2)-2,3',4',5-tetraCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB70), 3-MeSO(2)-2,2',3',4',5-pentaCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB87), 3-MeSO(2)-2,2',4',5,5'-pentaCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB101), 3-MeSO(2)-2,2',3', 4',5,6-hexaCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB132), 3-MeSO(2)-2,2',3',4',5,5'-hexaCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB141), 3-MeSO(2)-2,2',4',5,5',6-hexaCB (3-MeSO(2)-CB149) and 4-MeSO(2)-2,2',4',5,5'-pentaCB (4-MeSO(2)-CB101) increased the activities of UDP-GT toward chloramphenicol, 4-nitrophenol and 4-methylumbelliferone. 4-MeSO(2)-2,2',4',5,5',6-hexaCB (4-MeSO(2)-CB149) increased the activity of UDP-GT toward chloramphenicol (UGT2B1) but not toward 4-nitrophenol (UGT1A6) and 4-methylumbelliferone (UGT1A6). The activity of UDP-GT toward thyroxine (T(4)) significantly increased after the administration of each of the seven 3-MeSO(2)-PCBs and 4-MeSO(2)-CB101. Significant correlation was found between the activity of UDP-GT toward T(4) and serum total T(4) concentration after the administration of each of the MeSO(2) derivatives except 4-MeSO(2)-CB149. In conclusion, seven 3-MeSO(2)-PCBs and 4-MeSO(2)-CB101 induce both UGT2B1 and UGT1A6, and 4-MeSO(2)-CB149 induces UGT 2B1. The results from the present study indicate that increase in the hepatic T(4) glucuronidation after the administration of the seven 3-MeSO(2)-PCBs and 4-MeSO(2)-CB101 possibly because of the induction of both UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 caused the reduction of serum T(4) levels.
10048153	Induction of cytochrome P450 isoforms, specifically CYP1A1, and their catalytic activities are potential biomarkers of environmental contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this study, dogs were exposed to 25 ppm or 5 ppm Aroclor 1248 (PCB mixture) daily in their diet for 10 or 20 weeks, respectively. Relative to controls, hepatic microsomes from dogs dosed with PCBs had higher levels of CYP1A1 detected in immunoblots and higher levels of EROD activity, but low levels of induction for CYP2B and PROD activity. Concentrations of 96 PCB congeners in serum and liver were evaluated using capillary chromatography. Results showed that all dogs exposed to PCB mixtures had higher levels of PCB in serum and liver. Dogs preferentially sequestered highly chlorinated PCB congeners in liver relative to serum. With these experiments, we demonstrated that EROD activity was a potentially sensitive marker of PCB exposure at 5 and 25 ppm. Furthermore, CYP1A1 and EROD activity were maximally induced in dogs consuming dietary concentrations only 2.5 times the maximal permissible level for human food (FDA). The value of CYP1A1 induction as a biomarker of PCB exposure was tenuous because neither CYP1A1 levels nor EROD activity correlated with total PCB body burden. However, a small subset of congeners were identified in liver that may strongly influence EROD and PROD induction. Finally, two dogs in the 25 ppm dose group were fasted for 48 h. After 24 h of fasting, several new congeners appeared in the serum and remained in the serum for the remainder of the fast. The fast caused a 293% increase in PCB concentration in serum. This increase has strong implications regarding mobilization of toxic PCBs in wildlife during fasting (e.g., migration, hibernation).
7992230	Previous studies demonstrated that cigarette smoking is associated with high elevations in levels of both cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and DNA adducts in human placenta. To date, the identity of the smoking related DNA adducts is not known. The DNA adducts identified in placenta of smokers could result from chemicals present in cigarette smoke, substances formed by CYP 1A1 metabolic activation of endogenous compounds, noncigarette related exposures or a combination of these processes. Exposure to contaminated rice oil containing large doses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) also resulted in massive elevation of CYP 1A1 in human placenta but formation of DNA adducts directly from this exposure has not previously been reported. The purpose for comparing the two populations was to test the hypothesis that if CYP 1A1 induction results in the metabolic activation of endogenous compounds, then DNA adducts should also be present in PCB/PCDF exposed tissues exhibiting high CYP 1A1 activity and some of the adducts detected in the placental DNA from smokers may be identified as those derived from the metabolic activation of endogenous compounds. To test this hypothesis, we measured DNA adducts using 32P-postlabeling to analyze placental DNA from women exposed to PCB/PCDF and from cigarette smokers where levels of CYP 1A1 were similarly elevated. There was no evidence of DNA adducts among specimens obtained from PCB/PCDF exposed individuals. These data suggest that CYP 1A1 induction alone (in the absence of cigarette smoking) does not induce the formation of DNA adducts detectable by this approach, and that smoking related adducts are not a consequence of CYP 1A1 induction mediated activation of endogenous compounds or xenobiotics other than cigarette smoke.
12727597	Consumption of sport-caught fish from the Great Lakes is a recognized source of human exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Understanding temporal changes in PCB body burden is crucial for evaluating exposure levels and augmenting validity of studies investigating their relationship to adverse health effects. Using data collected from 1980 to 1995, we evaluated longitudinal changes in serum PCB levels among 179 fisheaters and non-fisheaters of the Michigan Fisheater Cohort. Participants identified as fisheaters in 1980 ate 26 lb or more of sport-caught fish per year, whereas non-fisheaters ate less than 6 lb per year. We found a monotonic decline in serum PCB levels among all participants from a mean value of 24 ppb in 1980 to 12 ppb in 1994. This was paralleled by an 83% decrease in mean fish consumption among all participants over the same period. We combined demographic, lifestyle, and fish consumption information with PCB data and evaluated the data using regression models to identify predictors of PCB body burden over a 16-year period. Results of the mixed-effects linear regression model suggest that consumption of Lake Michigan fish before 1980, amount of sport-caught fish eaten in the past year, age, and year of data collection were significant determinants of current PCB body burden over the 16-year study period. PCB levels were particularly elevated for males who were classified as fisheaters in 1980, which may reflect higher levels of sport-caught fish consumption compared with female fisheaters.
15907660	To characterize the maternal-fetal transport of lipophilic endocrine disrupting chemicals, concentrations of polychlorinated (2,3,7,8-substituted) dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in maternal and fetal blood, and amniotic and allantoic fluids in cattle. Total toxicity equivalent quantity (TEQ) was highest in amniotic fluid on a fat-weight basis, whereas it was highest in maternal blood on a total weight basis. TEQ was lowest in allantoic fluid on either basis; 26 of 29 congeners analyzed in this experiment were detected in one or more samples. The largest number of congeners was detected in amniotic fluid. O8CDD, 2,3,4,7,8-P5CDF and 2,3',4,4',5-P5CB were the major congeners in PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs, respectively. The O8CDD concentration was higher in fetal blood than in maternal blood on a fat-weight basis, whereas concentrations of other congeners were lower in fetal blood than in maternal blood. Furthermore, on a fat-weight basis, the O8CDD concentration was considerably higher in allantoic fluid compared with other samples. Concentrations of major PCB congeners were higher in amniotic fluid than in maternal and fetal blood on a fat-weight basis. In conclusion, it is suggested that lipophilic endocrine-disrupting chemicals contained in maternal blood are all transferred to the fetal circulation via the placenta in cattle. Furthermore, the results of this experiment imply that O8CDD has different transportation systems from other dioxins in the circulation, and that a considerable amount of PCBs is excreted and accumulated in amniotic fluid during the fetal stage in cattle.
22817616	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), known endocrine disruptors, were banned in 1979 but persist in the environment. Previous studies are inconsistent regarding prenatal exposure to PCBs and pregnancy outcomes. We investigated associations between prenatal exposure to PCBs and gestational length and birth weight. METHODS: In a sample of 600 infants (born between 1960 and 1963) randomly selected from Child Health and Development Studies participants followed through adolescence we measured 11 PCB congeners in maternal post partum sera (within three days of delivery). Length of gestation was computed from the reported first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and delivery date. Linear regression was used to estimate associations between PCB exposure and gestational age and birth weight, adjusting for potential confounders. PCBs were grouped according to hypothesized biological action (1b (sum of weak phenobarbital inducers), 2b (sum of limited dioxin activity), and 3 (sum of CYP1A and CYP2b inducers)) or degree of ortho- substitution (mono, di, tri). Secondary analyses examined associations between total PCB exposure and exposure to individual congeners. RESULTS: Each unit increase in mono-ortho substituted PCBs was associated with a 0.30 week decrease (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59, -0.016), corresponding to a 2.1 (95% CI -4.13, -0.11) day decrease in length of gestation. Similar associations were estimated for di-ortho substituted PCBs, (1.4 day decrease; (95% CI -2.9, 0.1)) and group 3 PCBs (0.84 day decrease; (95% CI -1.8, 0.11). We found similar associations in congener specific analyses and for the sum of congeners. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new evidence that PCB exposure shortens length of gestation in humans. This may have public health implications for population exposures. 
11065080	UNLABELLED: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins are environmental pollutants. Prenatally, as well as postnatally through breast feeding, large amounts are transferred from mother to the child. Formula is free of these substances. Considering their potential developmental neurotoxicity, we investigated long term effects of perinatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins on neurological and cognitive development. Given the evidence that PCBs exert oestrogenic effects, and oestrogens are known to suppress lactation, we investigated the effect of maternal PCB body load on lactation performances as well. METHODS: A group of 418 infants were followed from birth up to 6 years of age. Half of them were fully breast fed (BF) for at least 6 weeks. Prenatal PCB exposure was measured from cord and maternal blood. Postnatal exposure was reflected by PCB and dioxin levels in breast and formula milk and plasma PCB levels at 42 months of age. Both neurological and cognitive development were taken as outcome variable at 18, 42 months and at 6 years of age. At 18 and 42 months of age neurological condition was evaluated according to Hempel and at 6 years of age according to Touwen. Condition was evaluated in terms of optimality. Separately, the fluency of movements was scored. Cognitive abilities were measured at 18 months by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, at 42 months of age by the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) and at 6 years of age by the McCarthy Scales. Daily breast milk volume and milk fat content in relation to PCB body load was evaluated in 102 mothers. Multivariate regression models were applied to analyse associations of measured exposure variables with independent variables adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: At 18 months of age cognitive development was not affected by either pre- or postnatal exposure to the measured PCBs and dioxins. However, neurological examination showed an adverse effect of prenatal exposure to the measured pollutants on neurological optimality score. At 42 months of age we found negative associations between prenatal PCB exposure on cognitive development. However no effect was demonstrated on postnatal exposure to the measured pollutants. Neurological development was not affected by either pre- or postnatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins. At 6 years of age the preliminary results revealed evidence that cognitive development is affected by prenatal exposure to these pollutants in children from young mothers. An adverse effect of prenatal exposure on neurological outcome was also demonstrated in the formula fed group but not in the breast fed group. Despite a higher PCB exposures from breast milk we found at 18 months, 42 months of age, and at 6 years of age a beneficial effect of breast feeding on the quality of movements, in terms of fluency, and on the cognitive development tests. Maternal PCB body load was inversely related to 24-h breast milk volume and milk fat content. CONCLUSION: These data give evidence that prenatal exposure to PCBs do have subtle negative effects on neurological and cognitive development of the child up to school-age. Human breast milk volume and fat content is adversely affected by the presently encountered PCB levels in W. Europe. Our studies showed evidence that breast feeding counteracts the adverse developmental effects of PCBs and dioxins. 
7973610	PCB concentrations and total lipid content were determined in the blubber and liver of striped dolphins affected by the 1990 morbillivirus epizootic in the Mediterranean Sea, and in the blubber of striped dolphins from the same area sampled with a biopsy dart in 1987-1989 and 1991. PCB levels were found to be significantly higher in the individuals that succumbed to the epizootic than in the 'healthy' population sampled before or after the event. Although recent mobilization of lipid reserves was found to have occurred in some of the diseased dolphins, this had little effect on their PCB blubber concentrations and cannot explain the observed difference with the healthy individuals. Three hypotheses are put forward to explain the apparent link between high PCB levels and mortality caused by the epizootic: (i) depressed immunocompetence caused by PCBs leading to an increase in individual susceptibility to the morbillivirus infection, (ii) mobilization of fat reserves leading to increased PCB levels in blood which, in turn, may produce a liver lesion capable of increasing the individual's susceptibility to the morbillivirus infection, and (iii) previous existence of an unspecific hepatic lesion producing impairment of the liver function which, in turn, could lead to an increase both in tissue PCB concentrations and in individual susceptibility to the morbillivirus infection.
6799414	A radioimmunoassay was developed capable of determining Aroclor 1260 in milk at levels of from 20 to 80 ppb and in blood from 2 to 16 ppb. The values obtained by radioimmunoassay correlate well with those determined by gas-liquid chromatography (r2 = 0.96 for milk and 0.99 for blood) but were lower. Antiserum was produced in rabbits and was specific for 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl. It cross-reacted with congeners and isomers in Aroclor 1254 and 1260 to the extent that a 20% decrease in binding was observed with 0.1 ng of either mixture. The method requires preliminary cleanup of the extract on alumina and utilizes 25% dimethyl sulfoxide in the assay medium to promote solubilization of the substrates.
17208274	We evaluated the impact of the 1999 Belgian dioxin incident on the blood plasma polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) levels among 232 Belgian blood donors (74% men, mean age 47 years). The Red Cross made plasma samples from before the incident of these donors available. A second plasma sample was collected during the second half of 2000. The sum of the 17 PCDD/F congeners was significantly lower in 2000 compared to 1998 (417 pg/g fat versus 445 pg/g fat, respectively). This could be completely attributed to the significant decrease of OctaCDD (301 pg/g fat in 2000 versus 277 pg/g fat in 1998). Moreover a slight but significant decrease was observed for 2,3,7,8-TetraCDF and for 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HeptaCDF. 1,2,3,7,8-PentaCDF and 2,3,4,7,8-PentaCDF however showed a slight but significant increase (respective levels in 1998 were 0.004 and 14.5 pg/g fat compared to 0.006 and 17.9 pg/g fat in 2000). Given their significantly higher presence in incident related food samples this increase can be attributed to the food contamination episode. However, the total toxicity remained unchanged (22.9 in 1998 versus 23.1 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat, p>0.05). Moreover the observed congener profiles and the total PCDD/F levels were similar to those of other European non-occupationally exposed populations. In conclusion, the 1999 PCB/dioxin incident was traceable in the plasma profiles (rise of the two specific PCDF congeners), but comparison of the results for both years indicates that the changes were too small to cause an adverse public health effect.
12948891	Scientific and public concern exists about potential reproductive health effects of persistent chlorinated organic chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, the most stable daughter compound of DDT). To explore the hypothesis that environmental exposures to PCBs and DDE are associated with altered semen parameters, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 212 male partners of subfertile couples who presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital Andrology Laboratory. Semen parameters were analyzed as both a continuous measure and dichotomized based on World Health Organization reference values for sperm concentration (< 20 million/mL), motility (< 50% motile), and Kruger strict criteria for morphology (< 4% normal). The comparison group for the dichotomized analysis was men with all three semen parameters above the reference values. In serum, 57 PCB congeners and p,p -DDE were measured by congener-specific analysis using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. There were dose-response relationships among PCB-138 and sperm motility (odds ratio per tertile, adjusted for age, abstinence, and smoking, and p-value for trend were, respectively, 1.00, 1.68, 2.35, and p-value = 0.03) and morphology (1.00, 1.36, 2.53, p-value = 0.04). There was limited evidence of an inverse relationship between sum of PCBs, as well as those PCBs classified as cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, with sperm motility and sperm morphology, as well as limited evidence of an inverse association between p,p -DDE and sperm motility. The lack of a consistent relationship among semen parameters and other individual PCB congeners and groupings of congeners may indicate a difference in spermatotoxicity between congeners.
18569567	Blood samples from 226 pregnant women aged between 19 and 41 yr, living in an industrialized area of Germany (Duisburg birth cohort study), were collected between September 2000 and November 2002 and analyzed for their content of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were in the range of 4.34-97.3 pg WHO 1998 TEq/g(lipid base) (median: 25.96) or 3.77-63.56 pg WHO 2005 TEq/g(lipid base) (median: 19.38), respectively. Whole blood volume-based concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and their metabolites were 0.036-0.53 microg/L (median: 0.15) hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 4.5-1300 ng/L (median: 67) beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), 0.6-520 ng/L (median: 18) 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and 0.1-9.1 microg/L (median: 0.54) 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE). Parameters influencing the POP levels in human blood were examined using multiple regression models. Levels and the levels scatter widths of most PCDD/F and PCB congeners and HCB increased significantly with age. Within the multiple regression model a weak age dependence was also found for beta-HCH and DDT, whereas blood levels of alpha- and gamma- HCH and DDE were not age dependent. The total lactation period for earlier born children decreased most POP blood levels, except for alpha- and gamma-HCH. Over the study period of 27 mo only a low decreasing effect on human POP blood levels was observed. The body mass index had in general no or a low positive influence on contaminant levels. Because exposure to PCDD/F and PCB is higher in most industrialized countries in comparison to less industrialized ones, lower levels of these substances were detected in blood samples of women who had lived outside Western Europe for a longer period. In contrast, these women showed higher blood levels of organochlorine pesticides, indicating that these chemicals are still in use outside Western Europe.
12055051	In this study, we investigated 17- to 18-year-old boys and girls to determine whether changes in humoral or cellular immunity or respiratory complaints were related to blood serum levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin-like compounds after lifetime exposure in Flanders (Belgium). We obtained blood samples from and administered questionnaires to 200 adolescents recruited from a rural area and two urban suburbs. Physicians recorded medical history and respiratory diseases. We measured immunologic biomarkers such as differential blood cell counts, lymphocyte phenotypes, and serum immunoglobulins. As biomarkers of exposure, we determined the serum concentrations of PCBs (PCB 138, PCB 153, and PCB 180) and dioxin-like compounds [chemical-activated luciferase expression (CALUX) bioassay]. The percentages of eosinophils and natural killer cells in blood were negatively correlated with CALUX toxic equivalents (TEQs) in serum (p = 0.009 and p = 0.05, respectively). Increased serum CALUX TEQs resulted in an increase in serum IgA levels (p = 0.05). Furthermore, levels of specific IgEs (measured by radioallergosorbent tests) of cat dander, house dust mite, and grass pollen were also significantly and negatively associated with the CALUX TEQ, with odds ratios (ORs) equal to 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.96], 0.68 (0.5-0.93), and 0.70 (0.52-0.95), respectively. In addition, reported allergies of the upper airways and past use of antiallergic drugs were negatively associated with CALUX TEQs, with ORs equal to 0.66 (0.47-0.93) and 0.58 (0.39-0.85), respectively. We found a negative association between IgGs and marker PCBs in serum (p = 0.009). This study shows that immunologic measurements and respiratory complaints in adolescents were associated with environmental exposure to polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs). The negative correlation between PHAHs and allergic responses in adolescents suggested that exposure may entail alterations in the immune status.
17617441	Understanding the influence of maternal exposures on gestational age and birth weight is essential given that pre-term and/or low birth weight infants are at risk for increased mortality and morbidity. We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) through accidental contamination of cattle feed and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) through residual contamination in the geographic region. Our study population consisted of 444 mothers and their 899 infants born between 1975 and 1997. Using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, no significant association was found between estimated maternal serum PBB at conception or enrollment PCB levels and gestational age or infant birth weight in unadjusted models or in models that adjusted for maternal age, smoking, parity, infant gender, and decade of birth. For enrollment maternal serum PBB, no association was observed for gestational age. However, a negative association with high levels of enrollment maternal serum PBB and birth weight was suggested. We also examined the birth weight and gestational age among offspring of women with the highest (10%) PBB or PCB exposure, and observed no significant association. Because brominated compounds are currently used in consumer products and therefore, are increasingly prevalent in the environment, additional research is needed to better understand the potential relationship between in utero exposure to brominated compounds and adverse health outcomes.
16406051	High levels of PCBs were recently found in soil, food and some farmers living close to a chemical factory which until the 1980s had produced polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Brescia, North Italy. We performed a survey on a random sample of subjects aged 20-79 years living in various areas of the town with different levels of soil pollution to investigate factors associated with increased levels of PCB in serum (24 congeners were tested). Total PCB values were closely related to age (Spearman r=0.68; p<0.0001). The 166 consumers of locally produced food had higher PCB levels than non-consumers (median=1143 versus 719; 95th centile=9301 versus 2635ng/g lipid) with the highest levels among consumers of food produced in the most contaminated area close to the factory (median=2551; 95th centile=33464ng/g lipid). A dose-effect relationship between consumption of food produced in this area and PCB blood levels was observed (Spearman r=0.52, p=0.0014). Consumers of only plant food produced in this area had higher levels of PCB than non-consumers (median=1100; 95th centile=10,800ng/g lipid). Three subjects who had worked at the factory in the past showed high PCB levels. Distribution of PCB congeners did not differ between consumers of locally produced food and non-consumers, apart from PCB 209 which was found at high levels in former factory workers and was more common among consumers of food produced in the polluted area. In conclusion, we found high serum PCB levels in humans living in a highly polluted area in an industrialized town in Italy, due mainly to consumption of food produced in polluted areas.
9860495	The metabolism of three mono-ortho-substituted congeners, 2,3,3',4, 4'-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB105), 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB118), and 2,3,3',4,4',5-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB156), was investigated with regard to the identification of hydroxy- and sulfur-containing metabolites and their tissue retention in rats. Hydroxylation proceeded primarily at the meta or para position either via an arene oxide, involving NIH shift and dechlorination, or by direct insertion of a hydroxyl group. CB105 was hydroxylated preferably in the 2,3,4-trichlorinated ring to yield 4-OH-2,3,3',4', 5-pentaCB, whereas CB118 was hydroxylated in the 2,4, 5-trichlorinated ring to yield the same hydroxy metabolite to a similar extent. The concentration of 4-OH-2,3,3',4',5-pentaCB in blood was >3 times higher than that in liver, lung, or kidney. The ratios of 4-OH-2,3,3',4',5-pentaCB to unchanged CB in blood were 11:1 for CB105 and 7:1 for CB118. The other two metabolites, 4'-OH-2, 3',4,5,5'-pentaCB from CB118 and 4'-OH-2,3,3',4,5,5'-hexaCB from CB156, also exhibited a high blood affinity. Another metabolism of mono-ortho-PCBs PCBs involved methylthiolation in the vicinal ortho and meta unsubstituted positions to give methylthio metabolites, which were detected as methylsulfonyl metabolites in liver and adipose tissue. The tissue retention of these metabolites might contribute to the toxic and biologic effects of mono-ortho-substituted PCBs.
15336716	The aim of the present study was to investigate if environmental doses of PCB 153 and PCB 126 could produce effects in a controlled animal model. Possible adverse effects on the hypothalamic-pitutitary-gonadal axis were examined by measuring gonadotrophins and gonadal steroid hormone concentrations in goat kids exposed during gestation and lactation. The concentrations of PCB 153 and PCB 126 in adipose tissue in the goat kids 9 months post-partum were 5800 ng/g (fat-weight, range; 2900-12700 ng/g) and 0.49 ng/g (fat-weight, range; 0.28-0.80 ng/g), respectively. The pre- and post-pubertal plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin (Prl) and progesterone (P4) were analysed. LH, FSH, Prl, and P4 were also measured during an induced oestrus cycle. The prepubertal LH concentration was significantly lower, the puberty was delayed and the P4 level during the luteal phase of an estrous cycle was higher in the group exposed to PCB 153. No significant effect of PCB 153 exposure was found on Prl and FSH. PCB 126 did not produce any effects at the exposure level tested in this study. In conclusion, perinatal exposure to PCB 153 affected the reproductive function and the puberty maturation in goats.
15697172	Over 30 years have passed since the accidental polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) poisoning in Japan and yet high concentrations of PCB are still detected in the serum of the victims. PCB produces superoxide and thus victims of PCB poisoning are in a persistent state of oxidative stress. To examine the antioxidative state, we measured the serum concentrations of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD in 38 victims and 20 age-matched control subjects. The mean serum concentration of Cu, Zn-SOD was significantly lower and that of Mn-SOD higher than those of the control. Such an antioxidative state is indicative of an imbalance of Redox regulation mechanism. Persistence of imbalance could result in serious ailments in the future.
19750113	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides are endocrine disruptors, altering both thyroid and estrogen hormonal systems. Less is known of action on androgenic systems. OBJECTIVE: We studied the relationship between serum concentrations of testosterone in relation to levels of PCBs and three chlorinated pesticides in an adult Native American (Mohawk) population. METHODS: We collected fasting serum samples from 703 adult Mohawks (257 men and 436 women) and analyzed samples for 101 PCB congeners, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and mirex, as well as testosterone, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The associations between testosterone and tertiles of serum organochlorine levels (both wet weight and lipid adjusted) were assessed using a logistic regression model while controlling for age, body mass index (BMI), and other analytes, with the lowest tertile being considered the referent. Males and females were considered separately. RESULTS: Testosterone concentrations in males were inversely correlated with total PCB concentration, whether using wet-weight or lipid-adjusted values. The odds ratio (OR) of having a testosterone concentration above the median was 0.17 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05-0.69] for total wet-weight PCBs (highest vs. lowest tertile) after adjustment for age, BMI, total serum lipids, and three pesticides. The OR for lipid-adjusted total PCB concentration was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.06-0.78) after adjustment for other analytes. Testosterone levels were significantly and inversely related to concentrations of PCBs 74, 99, 153, and 206, but not PCBs 52, 105, 118, 138, 170, 180, 201, or 203. Testosterone concentrations in females are much lower than in males, and not significantly related to serum PCBs. HCB, DDE, and mirex were not associated with testosterone concentration in either men or women. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation in serum PCB levels is associated with a lower concentration of serum testosterone in Native American men. 
21141999	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitously present in the environment and suspected of carcinogenic, neurological, and immunological effects. Our purpose was to identify predictors of adipose tissue levels of mono-, di-, and tri-ortho-substituted PCBs experienced by a general population and to establish whether predictors vary according to substitution group. In this study of 245 randomly selected persons from a prospective Danish cohort of 57,053 persons, we examined geographical area, age, lactation, BMI, and intake of eight major dietary groups as potential determinants of adipose concentrations of mono-, di-, and tri-ortho-substituted PCBs by linear regression analyses. Lactation, BMI, and intake of fruit, vegetables, and dairy products showed negative associations with PCB concentrations in adipose tissue in all models, and living in Copenhagen city, age, and consumption of fish (particularly fatty fish) were positively associated. The associations between several of the predictors and mono-ortho-substituted PCBs tended to differ from the associations found for di- and tri-ortho-substituted PCBs. In conclusion, geography, age, lactation, BMI, and consumption of fatty fish consistently predicted the concentration of PCBs in adipose tissue. Our results indicate that predictors of PCBs varied according to substitution group, suggesting that ortho-substituted groups should be analyzed separately.
11814327	In a previous experiment, maternal exposure to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture reconstituted according to the congener pattern found in human breast milk resulted in decreased aromatase activity in the brain of newborn male rats, together with feminization of sweet preference behavior in adult male littermates. Both mixtures led to similar reductions of serum testosterone and testes weights. The purpose of the present study was (1) to examine the dose-response relationship for the reconstituted mixture and (2) to study if the rewarding properties of testosterone are affected at levels sufficient to alter sweet preference behavior. Female rats were fed diets with 0, 5, 20, or 40 mg PCBs/kg diet, resulting in an average daily intake of 0, 0.5, 2, or 4 mg/kg body wt. Exposure started 50 days prior to mating and was continued until birth of the offspring. A dose-dependent elevation of sweet preference was found in adult male offspring, indicating feminization of this sexually dimorphic behavior. Examination of conditioned place preference revealed a preference for the testosterone-paired side at the highest exposure condition. In weanling female offspring, dose-dependent reductions of serum testosterone and estradiol concentrations were detected. In addition, testosterone concentrations were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in adult male littermates long after termination of exposure. PCB concentrations in adipose tissue from offspring of the low dose group (0.5 mg/kg body wt) were approximately 10 times higher than values at the upper margin of current human exposure. Taken together, results indicate long-lasting and dose-dependent changes in sex-dependent behaviors and levels of sex steroid hormones in rats following developmental exposure to a PCB mixture that resembles the breast milk pattern.
18722600	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are ubiquitous pollutants found in the environment and human tissues. A cohort in Taiwan has undergone follow-up for 24 years after exposure to high levels of PCBs and PCDFs. The incidence of chloracne, hyperkeratosis, and abnormal nail was increased among exposed people. We conducted a study to identify the genes whose expressions were affected by such exposure. A cDNA microarray system consisting of 908 genes was used for pooled serum samples from non-smoking men exposed to PCBs and PCDFs (n=15) and their matched referents (n=15) in triplicate. After adjusting for background and housekeeping genes, genes with different expressions between the exposure and reference groups were determined by both regression and cluster analysis, and further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. The tumor suppressor gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) was found to be down-regulated in the microarray analysis. VHL gene expression levels were also found to be positively associated with age, shown by real-time RT-PCR. Upon age adjustment, VHL gene expression was reduced in Yucheng ("oil disease") subjects as compared to referents. Among Yucheng people, those with abnormal nails had lower VHL expressions than those without abnormal nails. These findings provide new insights into the potential role of VHL in health conditions associated with PCB and PCDF exposures.
3921366	A mass outbreak of poisoning occurred in central Taiwan in 1979 due to the ingestion of rice-bran oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and quaterphenyls (PCQs). The incident was called PCB poisoning or Yu-Cheng in Taiwan. The major PCB and PCDF congeners in the toxic oil and in the blood and tissues of the poisoned patients were characterized by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using highly efficient glass capillary columns. The levels of toxic agents in the rice oil samples collected from the factory and school cafeterias and the families of the poisoned patients are in the range of 53 to 99 ppm, 0.18 to 0.40 ppm and 25 to 53 ppm for PCBs, PCDFs, and PCQs, respectively. The blood samples of 165 patients collected 9 to 18 months after the onset of poisoning contained 10 to 720 ppb of PCBs, with a mean value of 38 ppb. The blood samples of 10 patients collected 9 to 27 months after poisoning contained 0.02 to 0.20 ppb of PCDFs. Comparative rates of elimination of some PCB congeners from the blood of patients were studied. Various tissues from a patient who died 2 years after poisoning were analyzed for PCBs, PCDFs and PCQs. The intestinal fat contains the highest level of PCBs, while the liver contains the highest concentration of PCDFs. The PCB congeners retained in the tissues either do not have adjacent unsubstituted carbon atoms or have a pair at ortho-meta positions of the biphenyl ring. The major PCDF congeners retained in the tissues were 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachloro-DF, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachloro-DF and 1,2,4,7,8-pentachloro-DF. The former two congeners, especially 2,3,4,7,8-pentachloro-DF, are very toxic PCDFs; they may play important roles in the etiology of Yu-Cheng.
19150735	Bioaccumulation of endocrine disruptors in marine mammals positioned at the top of the food chain is of toxicological concern. Livers from four pups and ten adult harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) stranded in San Francisco Bay (SFB) and the Gulf of Maine (GOM) were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs). We used GC-ECD and GC-NCI/MS to investigate the presence of 28 PCBs and 8 OH-PCB metabolites, respectively. Sigma(28)PCB concentrations (di- to octa-CBs) ranged from 1.81 to 35.9 microg/g lipid with a median of 6.53 for the seal pups and 2.31 to 249 microg/g lipid with a median of 28.9 for the adult seals. Sigma(8)OH-PCB concentrations (penta- to hepta-OH-PCBs) ranged from 0.02 to 0.69 microg/g lipid with a median of 0.04 for the adult seals, i.e., at much lower concentrations than those for PCBs. Ratios of OH-PCBs to PCBs (0.24% on average) were comparable to those in beluga whale, but were lower than ratios in human livers. The OH-PCB profiles were slightly different between SFB and GOM seal livers, although similar PCB congener patterns were observed. Generally, 4-OH-CB107 was found predominantly in seal livers and was the only OH-PCB detectable in most of seal pup livers. This study provides information on OH-PCBs in seals, adding to the scarce exposure data for these chemicals.
20578718	Dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent and bioaccumulative toxic chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment. We assessed predictors of their serum concentrations among women living in a Russian town contaminated by past industrial activity. Blood samples from 446 mothers aged 23-52 years were collected between 2003-2005 as part of the Russian Children's Study. Serum dioxin, furan, and PCB concentrations were quantified using high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Potential determinants of exposure were collected through interviews. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify predictors of serum concentrations and toxic equivalencies (TEQs). The median total PCB concentrations and total TEQs were 260 ng/g lipid and 25 pg TEQ/g lipid, respectively. In multivariate analyses, both total PCB concentrations and total TEQs increased significantly with age, residential proximity to a local chemical plant, duration of local farming, and consumption of local beef. Both decreased with longer breastfeeding, recent increases in body mass index, and later blood draw date. These demographic and lifestyle predictors showed generally similar associations with the various measures of serum dioxins, furans, and PCBs.
10698477	This case-control study was designed to investigate the relationship between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE) and breast cancer risk in Connecticut. Cases were incident breast cancer patients who were either residents of Tolland County or who had a breast-related surgery at the Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven County. Controls were randomly selected from Tolland County residents or from patients who had newly diagnosed benign breast diseases or normal tissue at Yale-New Haven Hospital. A total of 475 cases and 502 controls had their serum samples analyzed for PCBs and DDE in 1995-1997. The age- and lipid-adjusted geometric mean serum level of DDE was comparable between the cases (460.1 ppb) and controls (456.2 ppb). The geometric mean serum level of PCBs was also comparable between cases (733.1 ppb) and controls (747.6 ppb). After adjustment for confounding factors, odds ratios of 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-1.36) for DDE and 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.32) for PCBs were observed when the third tertile was compared with the lowest. Further stratification by parity, lactation, and menopausal and estrogen receptor status also showed no significant association with serum levels of DDE or PCBs. The results by PCB congener groups also showed no major increased risk associated with any of the congener groups. Our study does not support the hypothesis that DDE and PCBs, as encountered through environmental exposure, increase the risk of female breast cancer.
21345762	BACKGROUND: Human exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remains widespread. PCBs have been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes including reduced fecundability and increased risk of pregnancy loss, although the human data remain largely inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore the relationship between serum PCB concentrations and early pregnancy loss among a large cohort of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) between 1994 and 2003. METHODS: Concentrations of 57 PCB congeners were measured in serum samples collected during 827 IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles from 765 women. Joint statistical models that accommodate multiple outcomes and multiple cycles per woman were used to assess the relationship between serum PCB quartiles and implantation failure, chemical pregnancies (human chorionic gonadotropin level > 5.0 mIU/mL) that did not result in clinical pregnancy, or spontaneous abortion, while also adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: PCB-153 was the congener present in the highest concentration (median, 46.2 ng/g lipid). Increasing quartiles of PCB-153 and the sum of all measured PCB congeners (ΣPCBs) were associated with significantly elevated dose-dependent odds of failed implantation. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for highest versus lowest quartile were 2.0 (1.2-3.4) for PCB-153 and 1.7 (1.0-2.9) for ΣPCBs. There were suggestive trends for increased odds of implantation failure for PCB-118 and cytochrome P450-inducing congeners (p-values for trend = 0.06). No statistically significant associations between PCBs and chemical pregnancy or spontaneous abortion were found. CONCLUSIONS: Serum PCB concentrations at levels similar to the U.S. general population were associated with failed implantation among women undergoing IVF. These findings may help explain previous reports of reduced fecundability among women exposed to PCBs. 
12395836	The effects of exposure to butyltin compounds (BTs: tributyltin; TBT, dibutyltin; DBT and monobutyltin; MBT) and non-ortho coplanar PCBs (IUPAC 77, 126 and 169) on marine mammals and human lymphocyte were evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), a California sealion (Zalophus californianus), a larga seal (Phocoa largha) and humans (Homo sapiens) were exposed at varying concentrations of BTs and coplanar PCBs. Concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated mitogenesis found significantly suppressed (P<0.01) when the cells were exposed at 300 nM (89 ng/ml) of TBT and 330 nM of DBT (77 ng/ml), while MBT showed little cytotoxicity at treatment levels of up to 3,600 nM (620 ng/ml). BTs concentrations in the liver of Dall's porpoises from Japanese coastal waters ranged between 81-450 ng/g for TBT and 200-1,100 ng/g (wet wt.) for DBTs, which is greater than the cytotoxic levels registered in this study. In contrast, non-ortho coplanar PCBs did not suppress cell proliferation at concentrations of up to 30 nM (10 ng/ml). The residue levels of coplanar PCBs in the blubber of Dall's porpoises were 0.12-1.3 ng/g, which were one order of lower than those levels that do cell proliferation. When cells were exposed to a mixture of TBT/DBTand coplanar PCBs, the proliferation was significantly reduced to 33 nM DBT plus 34 nM CB-77 and 33 nM DBT plus 28 nM CB-169 mixtures, respectively. The investigations relating the contaminant-induced immunosuppression in marine mammals have been focused on persistent organochlorines such as PCBs. pesticides and dioxin compounds. However, this study suggested the possibility of BTs could also pose a serious threat to the immune functions in free-ranging marine mammals and humans.
1759848	Phenoclor DP5 (DP5), a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was administered to lactating rat dams, every two days from postnatal days 2 to 20, at 50 mg/kg of body weight. Resulting effects on tissue concentrations of PCBs and on liver lipids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins and blood lipids of offspring, at different times after weaning, until postnatal day 100, were studied. On postnatal day 21, DP5 contents found in liver, brain and fat of young rats indicated that a great part of the dam's body stores of PCBs was eliminated into the milk. These accumulations were related to an increase of relative liver weight, a decrease in DNA concentration and a rise in liver RNA, protein and phospholipid levels, indicating an inducing effect of DP5 in weanling rat. Changes in lipid metabolism were associated with increases of liver triacylglycerol and cholesterol and decrease of blood triacylglycerol. Both sexes exhibited an identical responsiveness to PCBs. The biochemical alterations observed in liver and blood at weaning, disappeared with time and were no longer detectable after postnatal day 40 in both sexes. Relative liver weight increase persisted until postnatal day 60 in males and postnatal day 100 in females. Residual aspects of alterations induced before weaning, by exposure via milk, could persist until postnatal day 100. Permanent effects of PCBs, after perinatal exposure could be assessed in later life of rats, when PCBs were almost completely cleared from body tissues.
17459649	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of widely dispersed and environmentally persistent organic compounds. PCBs exhibit a wide range of toxicological effects including neurotoxicity. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is an important lipid soluble antioxidant placed in a special region of membranes. Large amounts of energy are required to maintain the signaling activities of the cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Membrane proteins that control ion gradients across organellar and plasma membranes appear to be particularly susceptible to oxidation-induced changes. The aim of this study was to determine the protective role of vitamin E on Aroclor 1254 induced modulation in membrane bound ATPases in brain regions of rats. One group of rats received corn oil as vehicle for 30days as control. The other group of rats were administered Aroclor 1254 at a dose of 2mgkg(-1) bwday(-1) intraperitoneally for 30days. One group of rats received vitamin E (50mgkg(-1) bwday(-1)) orally simultaneously with Aroclor 1254 for 30days. After 30days, the animals were euthanized and the brain was dissected to hypothalamus and hippocampus to determine the following parameters. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase were determined. Reduced glutathione (GSH) level was also determined. Activities of all the enzymes were decreased while an increase in H2O2 and LPO were observed in selected brain regions of PCB treated animals. Simultaneous vitamin E treatment in PCB exposed animals restored all the parameters significantly. These results suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the inhibitory effect of PCB (Aroclor 1254) on membrane bound ATPases in selected brain regions. alpha-tocopherol acts against PCB induced neurotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress.
12222776	In 1999, the FLEHS was set by the Flemish Ministry of Health, Belgium to assess pollutant concentrations and related health effect biomarkers in humans living in Flanders. Concentrations of selected organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and furans (PCDF) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Chemical-Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (CALUX) bioassay in 47 serum pools of 200 women between 50 and 65 years living in two areas of Flanders. Correlation between TEQ values of different groups of compounds were computed in these pool results and it was found that total toxic equivalencies (TEQs) correlated well with the values of the groups of contributing compounds: mono-ortho PCBs (r = 0.77), non-ortho PCBs (r = 0.65) and PCDD/Fs (r = 0.88). The total TEQ was lower correlated to the CALUX-TEQ (r = 0.57). When calculating associations between those classes of compounds in the two studied regions separately, they were all higher correlated in the urban area compared to the more rural region. High correlation coefficients (r > 0.80) were also calculated between individual compounds and groups of compounds. It was suggested that in this studied background-exposed population, some compounds could be good predictors for a group: e.g. PCB 153 for indicator and total PCBs, PCB 118 for total PCB TEQ, PCB 156 for mono-ortho PCB-TEQs and total TEQ, 2,3,4,7,8-P5CDF for PCDD/F TEQs and total TEQs. This means that in pooled serum samples correlations between persistent organochlorine compounds are as strong as for individual POP measurements observed in earlier studies.
10910120	A review of the literature was conducted to investigate the importance to offspring of in utero and breast milk polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure. All reports that we could identify (n=25) were included, representing 16 study populations. Tissue-specific PCB concentrations in human placenta, breast milk, maternal blood and cord blood were compared to determine accumulation ratios between tissue compartments. On a lipid basis, the highest concentration of PCB in placenta (5027 ng/g fat) was 2.8 times higher than the highest concentration of PCB in breast milk ( 1770 ng/g fat). While there are limitations with regard to quantitation methods and statistical methods utilized by the reviewed studies, our results suggest that PCBs may be capable of crossing the placenta to a greater extent than previously believed. Future studies of PCB body burden in the perinatal period should include placenta, breast milk, maternal and cord blood specimens. In order to compare PCB concentrations in various tissues and with other studies, concentrations should be determined on a lipid basis.
18678409	This study was intended to determine the background levels of PCDD/PCDFs and PCBs in the Taiwanese population and to investigate factors potentially related to PCDD/PCDF and PCB levels. The levels of seventeen PCDD/PCDFs in the 251 serum samples collected from the general population in Taiwan ranged from 4.92 to 26.7 pg WHO(1998)-TEQ/g lipid (median: 11.5) and those of the twelve dioxin-like PCBs ranged between 1.74 and 21.6 pg WHO(1998)-TEQ/g lipid (median: 6.14). Five factors, age, gender, region of residence, dietary status, and smoking status, showed statistically significant association with the TEQ level of PCDD/PCDFs. The TEQ level of PCBs was statistically associated with age only, but not with the other four factors. The trends observed between age and the levels of PCDD/PCDFs and PCBs were not parallel in young subjects (<30 years old) and old subjects (>30 years old). The levels of PCDD/PCDFs and PCBs increased by 0.16 and 0.03 WHO(1998)-TEQ/g lipid per year for subjects above the age of 30, but there was no evidence of any association between age and the levels for subjects below the age of 30 years. These factors should be considered when investigating relationships between background serum levels of persistent organic pollutants and parameters associated with exposure sources or health outcomes.
15975248	Hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (HO-PCBs) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) are halogenated phenolic compounds, and they are increasingly common as environmental contaminants mainly in the blood of wildlife and humans. A methodology based on high-performance liquid chromatography (reversed-phase)-electrospray (negative) ionization-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(-)-MS-MS) in the select ion monitoring or multiple reaction monitoring modes was developed for HO-PCB and PCP determination in blood plasma and serum. Among 11 environmentally relevant HO-PCB congeners and PCP spiked to fetal calf serum, quantitative assessments, including matrix effects on ESI(-) suppression/ enhancement, showed process (recovery) efficiencies of 73% to 89% without internal standard (IS) correction, and 88% to 103% with IS correction, and method limits of quantification ranging from 1 to 50 pg/g (wet weight). Using the developed LC-ESI(-)-MS methodology in comparison with GC-MS and GC-ECD based approaches, similar results were found for HO-PCB identification and quantification in the plasma of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) from the Canadian arctic. LC-ESI(-)-MS identified four HO-PCB congeners [4'-HO-2,2',4,6,6'-pentachlorobiphenyl (4'-HO-CB104), 4-HO-2,3,3',4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (4-HO-CB107), 4-HO-2,3,3',5,5',6-hexachlorobiphenyl (4-HO-CB165) and 3'-HO-2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl (3'-HO-CB180)], and 14 additional tetra- to hepta-chlorinated HO-PCBs isomers in the polar bear plasma.
10473799	The concentrations of chlorinated biphenyls (CBs), 1, 1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and the methylsulfonyl metabolites of CBs (MeSO(2)-CBs) and DDE (MeSO(2)-DDE) were determined in human plasma samples and in the fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation of plasma into very-low-density (VLDL), low-density (LDL), high-density (HDL) lipoprotein and lipoprotein depleted (LPDP) fractions (containing primarily albumin). The concentrations of triacylglycerols, cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) were determined. The organochlorine compounds were associated with all fractions, but predominantly with the LPDP fraction. On an average 44% of CBs, 61% of MeSO(2)-CBs, 73% of DDE, 77% of MeSO(2)-DDE, and 45% of HCB were distributed in the LPDP fraction. A tendency to greater association of 3-methylsulfonyl substituted than of corresponding 4-methylsulfonyl substituted chlorobiphenyls to the LPDP fraction was noticed. Among the lipoprotein fractions, LDL was the main carrier of HCB, DDE and CBs. MeSO(2)-DDE was predominantly found in HDL and MeSO(2)-CBs were distributed equally among the LDL and HDL fractions. Calculating the concentrations of organochlorine compounds in relation to the content of apoB, the levels were about 10 times higher in VLDL than in LDL.
18829066	Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in serum samples from residents of a Korean urban area (Seoul). This study was performed on 40 Koreans in the general population, aged 27-58, who had resided in urban areas for more than 10 years without occupational exposure to organochlorine pollutants. To our knowledge, this study was the first report on serum concentrations of OCPs in Korean residents. p,p'-DDE, beta-HCH, p,p'-DDT, HCB, and trans-nonachlor were the dominant OCPs in most samples. In addition, concentrations of 22 OCPs were measured by the isotope dilution method with GC-HRMS, which gave accurate and precise data for investigations of trend and international comparisons. The dominant PCBs were PCB153, 138, 180, 187, and PCB118, which contributed 60% to total PCBs. The median concentrations of total OCPs and total PCBs were 315 ng g(-1) lipid and 104 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. In females, the serum concentrations of all determined organochlorine compounds except beta-HCH were positively correlated with age, and higher concentrations of organochlorine pollutants were found in males than in females. Compared to our previous studies, PCB concentrations in serum from urban areas have substantially decreased during the last decade leading to the observation that the strict regulation of PCBs was helpful in controlling the concentration of PCBs in the environment. Extensive monitoring programs are required for evaluating the concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in serum samples of the general population as an indicator of possible adverse health effects.
9765071	Male Sprague-Dawley rats received four consecutive intraperitoneal doses of four kinds of methylsulfonyl (MeSO2) metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners: 3-MeSO2-2,2',3',4',5,6-hexachlorobiphenyl (3-MeSO2-CB132); 3-MeSO2-2,2',3',4', 5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (3-MeSO2-CB141); 3-MeSO2-2,2',4',5,5',6-hexachlorobiphenyl (3-MeSO2-CB149) and 4-MeSO2-2,2',4',5,5',6-hexachlorobiphenyl (4-MeSO2-CB149). The congeners were major MeSO2-PCBs determined in human milk, liver and adipose tissue, and the aim was to determine their effect on thyroid hormone levels. All four tested MeSO2 metabolites (20 micromol/kg once daily for 4 days) reduced serum total thyroxine levels by 22-44% at a much lower dose than phenobarbital (PB; 431 micromol/kg once daily for 4 days) on days 2, 3, 4 and 7 after the final doses. Total triiodothyronine levels were reduced 37% by treatment with 4-MeSO2-CB149 at day 7. A 30% increase in thyroid weight was produced by 3-MeSO2-CB141 treatment. Total cytochrome P450 content was increased by 3-MeSO2-CB132, 3-MeSO2-CB141 and 3-MeSO2-CB149, but not by 4-MeSO2-CB149. Thus, it is likely that the 3-MeSO2-hexachlorobiphenyls and 4-MeSO2-CB149 could influence the thyroid hormone metabolism by different mechanism(s). The results show that tested 3- and 4-MeSO2 metabolites of PCB congeners reduce thyroid hormone levels much more than PB in rats. Our finding suggests that the metabolites may act as endocrine-disrupters.
17237730	Evidence is inconsistent or poorly understood for links between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 1,1'-dichloro-2,2'-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), and organophosphate (OP) pesticides and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although they are known developmental toxicants. We measured biomarkers of maternal exposure to DDE, PCB, and OP metabolites in the third trimester of pregnancy among 404 mothers in a multiethnic cohort in New York City. We also determined maternal paraoxonase (PON1), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChe), and PON1Q192R gene variant. Higher multivariate-adjusted DDE levels (but not PCB) were associated with lower birth weight (-98 g/log10 DDE, p = 0.096) and head circumference (-0.54 cm/log10 DDE, p = 0.030). DDE and PCB levels were not related to birth length, Ponderal index, or gestational age. Birth length was shorter for mothers with PON192RR slow genotype compared with PON192QQ (p = 0.026), and head circumference was inversely associated with maternal PON1 activity (p = 0.004). With slow-activity PON1 or PON192, urinary diethylphosphates (SigmaDEPs) were associated with lower birth weight and dimethylphosphates (SigmaDMPs) with shorter birth length. No associations were found between birth outcomes and BuChe. In summary, we found suggestive relationships between prenatal environmental biomarkers and birth outcomes in this population. Maternal susceptibility factors including PON1 and maternal weight contributed to the observed effects.
17545638	The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) unrelated to HIV infection has steadily increased over the past several decades and remains substantially unexplained. Limited evidence suggests that increased concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) measured in blood or fat tissue are associated with increased risk of NHL. Although PCB congeners vary in their biological activity, the relation between individual congeners and NHL risk has not been examined previously using prospectively collected biospecimens. We examined congener-specific associations in three prospective cohorts. Prediagnostic serum or plasma concentrations of selected PCB congeners were measured among NHL cases and controls from these cohorts: Janus (190 cases and 190 controls) in Norway and CLUE I (74 cases and 147 controls) and the Nurses' Health Study (30 cases and 78 controls) in the United States. All blood samples were collected in the 1970s or 1980s. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the relations between risk of NHL and lipid-corrected plasma or serum concentrations. Several congeners (i.e., 118, 138, and 153) that were present at higher levels and were moderately to highly correlated with each other showed exposure-response trends with risk of NHL in all three cohorts. These associations were observed primarily among subjects diagnosed closer to the date of blood collection in the two cohorts with sufficient cases to permit stratification by time. Among cases diagnosed within the median years of follow-up (16 years in Janus and 12 years in CLUE I), ORs and 95% CIs for increasing fourths of concentration of congener 118 relative to the lowest fourth were as follows: 2.4 (0.9-6.5), 4.9 (1.6-15.3), and 5.3 (1.5-18.8; P(trend) < 0.005) in Janus and 8.1 (1.0-68.9), 6.6 (0.7-59.0), and 13.0 (1.6-106.8; P(trend) < 0.05) in CLUE I. Similar patterns were seen for congeners 138 and 153 and for total PCBs. Limited evidence of exposure-response trends was also observed for several other congeners. The primary 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane metabolite, p,p'-DDE, was not significantly associated with NHL in most analyses but slightly to moderately confounded the PCB associations. The results from these three cohorts suggest that concentrations of certain PCBs in blood are associated with increased risk of NHL.
21298441	PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the factors associated with blood levels of each congener of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in the Japanese population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 1,656 subjects (755 men and 901 women) aged 15-73 years, who were living in 90 different areas of 30 prefectures in Japan. Blood levels of 29 PCDD, PCDF, and DL-PCB congeners were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In addition, a questionnaire survey on life style, including dietary habit, was carried out. RESULTS: The median total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) was 17 pgTEQ/g lipid. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking habit, and consumption of other food groups, six PCDDs/PCDFs with 4-6 substituted chlorine atoms and 10 DL-PCBs, but not HeptaCDD/F or OctaCDD, showed significant positive correlations with the frequency of intake of fish and shellfish. Furthermore, significant positive relationships were also found between plasma levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a biomarker of fish intake, and 10 PCDDs/PCDFs with 4-6 chlorine atoms and 10 DL-PCBs. The partial correlation coefficients with plasma DHA were significantly higher for DL-PCBs than for PCDDs/PCDFs, and partial correlation coefficients for PCDDs/PCDFs significantly decreased with increasing number of chlorine atoms (Spearman r = -0.80, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Blood levels of PCDDs/PCDFs with 4-6 chlorine atoms and DL-PCBs were positively associated with fish intake in the Japanese population. These results may be explained by the higher degree of bioaccumulation of these congeners in fish and shellfish in the ecosystem, and the high consumption of fish among the Japanese population. 
7818291	Fatty fish species, e.g., salmon and herring, in the Baltic Sea have high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT), and its main metabolite: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE). We determined levels of 10 different PCB congeners, including non- and mono-ortho-PCBs, as well as DDT and DDE, in human blood plasma from 37 subjects with varying intake of fish (0-1 750 g/wk) from the Baltic Sea. With respect to all of the PCB congeners we investigated, as well as for DDT and DDE, there were statistically significant associations with fish intake. Thus, fish from the Baltic Sea is a major source of exposure to these compounds in Swedes. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF) had been determined earlier in 29 of the subjects. The PCB contribution to "dioxin-like" effects among high consumers of fish (calculated as Nordic TCDD equivalents) was almost 80%, whereas that from PCDD and PCDF was only 20%.
12558169	The relationship between regional reproduction rates of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and concentrations of p.p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in blood plasma from nestling bald eagles was assessed. Blood was analyzed from 309 nestlings from 10 subpopulations of eagles across the Great Lakes region. Geometric mean concentrations of p,p'-DDE and total PCBs were inversely correlated to the productivity and success rates of nesting bald eagles within nine subpopulations. Nestlings eight weeks of age and older had significantly greater geometric mean concentrations of total PCBs and p,p'-DDE than nestlings less than eight weeks of age. The ability to use measurements of p,p'-DDE and total PCBs in nestling blood to determine the potential impact of these contaminants on adult nesting on a regional scale was demonstrated.
21296657	Developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) disrupts reproduction in animals. Human data are lacking. We measured PCBs in preserved mothers' serum samples collected during 1960-1963, 1-3 days after their daughters' birth. We recorded time to pregnancy (TTP) in 289 daughters 28-31 years later. PCB congeners 187, 156, and 99 in mother's serum were associated with longer TTP in their daughters while PCB congeners 105, 138 and 183 were associated shorter TTP. Probability of pregnancy fell by 38% (95% CI 17-53%) and infertility was higher (30% not pregnant after 13 cycles versus 11% not pregnant after 13 cycles) among women whose mothers had a higher proportion of PCB congeners associated with longer TTP (75th percentile versus 25th percentile). This study demonstrates, for the first time, that developmental exposure to PCBs may disrupt pregnancy in humans.
19059321	Human populations are simultaneously exposed to a variety of anthropogenic contaminants. However, despite extensive literature on animal exposure to single compounds, data on the toxicity of complex mixtures are scarce. The Northern Contaminant Mixture (NCM) was formulated to contain the 27 most abundant contaminants in the same relative proportions found in the blood of Canadian Arctic populations. Sprague-Dawley rat dams were dosed from the first day of gestation until weaning with methylmercury (MeHg), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or organochlorines pesticides (OCs) administered either separately or together in the NCM. An additional control group for hypothyroxinemia was included by dosing dams with the goitrogen 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU). Offspring growth, survival, serum thyroxine and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels, thyroid gland morphology, brain taurine content and cerebellum and hippocampus protein expression patterns resulting from such exposures were monitored. Pups' increased mortality rate and impaired growth observed in the NCM treatment group were attributed to MeHg, while decreased circulating thyroxine levels and perturbations of thyroid gland morphology were mostly attributable to PCBs. Interestingly, despite comparable reduction in serum thyroxine levels, PCBs and PTU exposures produced markedly different effects on pup's growth, serum TSH level and brain taurine content. Analysis of cerebellum and hippocampus protein expression patterns corroborated previous cerebellum gene expression data, as contaminant co-exposure in the NCM significantly masked the effects of individual components on protein two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns. Identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS of differentially expressed proteins involved notably in neuronal and mitochondrial functions provided clues on the cellular and molecular processes affected by these contaminant mixtures.
11952335	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are highly persistent contaminants in our environment. Their persistence is due to a general resistance to metabolic attack. Lower halogenated PCBs, however, are metabolized to mono- and dihydroxy compounds, and the latter may be further oxidized to quinones with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have shown that PCB metabolism generates ROS in vitro and in cells in culture and this leads to oxidative DNA damage, like DNA strand breaks and 8-oxo-dG formation. In the present study, we have evaluated the reactivity of PCB metabolites with other nucleophiles, like glutathione (GSH), by assessing (1) quantitative GSH binding in vitro, (2) GSH and thiol (sulfhydryl) depletion in HL-60 cells, (3) the associated cytotoxicity, and (4) the inhibition of topoisomerase II activity in vitro. PCB quinones were found to bind GSH in vitro at a ratio of 1:1.5 and to deplete GSH in HL-60 cells as measured by both spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods. By flow cytometry analysis, we confirmed that there was intracellular GSH depletion in HL-60 cells by PCB quinones and this is associated with cytotoxicity. On the other hand, the PCB hydroquinone metabolites did not bind GSH or other thiols within 1 h of exposure. However, by spectral analyses we found that the PCB hydroquinones could be oxidized enzymatically to the quinones, which could then bind GSH. The resulting hydroquinone-glutathione addition product(s) could undergo a second and third cycle of oxidation and GSH addition with the formation of di- and tri-GSH-PCB adducts. The effect of the PCB metabolites was also tested on a sulfhydryl-containing enzyme, topoisomerase II. PCB quinones inhibited topoisomerase II activity while the PCB hydroquinone metabolites did not. Hence, the oxidation of PCB hydroquinone metabolites to quinones in cells followed by the binding of quinones to GSH and to protein sulfhydryl groups and the resulting oxidative stress may be important aspects of the toxicity of these compounds.
16053925	Persistent organic pollutants have been linked to various adverse effects on human health. We conducted a retrospective exposure assessment for 11polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 4 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners. We analyzed paired samples of blood and food duplicate portions collected in the 1980s (1980 survey, N=40) and the mid-1990s (1995 survey, N=40) from females (five participants from each of eight sites per survey) living throughout Japan, from Hokkaido to Okinawa. The study populations in the 1980 and 1995 surveys were different but had lived in the same community. We measured PCBs and PBDEs in serum and PCBs in diet. Total serum PCBs (ng/g lipid) [geometric mean (geometric standard deviation)] were similar in the 1980 [163.0 (1.7)] and the 1995 [142.6 (2.0)] surveys. In contrast, dietary intake (ng/day) between 1980 and 1995 decreased significantly, from 522.8 (2.5) to 165.9 (3.3), respectively, (P<0.05). We classified the participants by birth year-before 1941 (older generation) and equal to or after 1941 (younger generation). Serum PCB levels decreased significantly in the younger generation, from 179.1 (1.8) in the 1980 survey to 115.4 (2.0) in the 1995 survey (P<0.05). However, in the older generation, serum levels (ng/g lipid) did not change: 150.4 (1.6) in the 1980 survey and 180 (1.8) in the 1995 survey. Total PBDE serum levels (ng/g lipid) increased significantly during the 15 years, from 0.5 (3.5) to 1.8 (3.7) (P<0.05). At the Shimane site, PBDE serum levels (ng/g lipid) increased 20-fold, from 1.3 (4.8) to 26.0 (5.0). The serum levels of PCBs decreased in the younger generation but not in the older, although levels in daily intakes decreased significantly. Exposure levels of PBDEs appear to be increasing in an area-specific manner.
16466768	BACKGROUND: An important question is whether human serum levels of persistent organic pollutants has continued to decrease during the last decades. The aim of this study was to assess intra-individual variations over time of serum levels of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-ethene (p,p'-DDE) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), considering the impact of a number of possible determinants. METHODS: Blood samples were drawn for the same 39 subjects in 1991 and 2001. Interviews were made at both occasions. Lipid adjusted serum concentrations of CB-153, p,p'-DDE and HCB were determined in both sets of blood samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The fatty acid composition of the serum lipids was analyzed by means of gas-liquid chromatography. RESULT: The CB-153 concentrations in serum had averagely decreased with 34% in between 1991 and 2001 (p<0.001). Of individual determinants only increasing BMI was associated with decreasing CB-153 levels (beta=-1.0, 95% CI -1.8, -0.2, p=0.01), explaining 13% of the variation. The average decrease of p,p'-DDE was 55%, and could only weakly be associated with a relative increase of BMI (beta=-1.0, 95% CI -2.3, 0.2, p=0.09), explaining only 5% of the variation. The average decrease of HCB was 53%, and was associated only with high fish consumption in 1991, explaining 12% of the variation. CONCLUSIONS: The results support a continuing decrease in human body burdens of PCBs, DDE and HCB during the 1990s. The explanatory factors relative change of BMI and fish consumption explained only a minor part of the time-related variations in serum levels. 
10739046	In order to get more information about potential health hazards due to indoor air PCBs the present study investigated the PCB indoor concentration in schools as well as the blood levels of 6 PCB-indicator congeners in teachers from these schools. 151 teachers (78 male and 73 female; mean age 48 years) from 3 contaminated and 2 control schools participated in the study. Maximal indoor air values for total PCBs (6 PCB-indicator congeners times 5) in schools ranged from 1587 to 10655 ng/m3. Blood analyses indicated an increase in mean PCB 28 level from 0.036 (control group) to 0.098 microg/l in teachers from a school with heavy contamination of low chlorinated PCB. But there was no significant increase of PCB 138, 153 and 180 in blood above the normal background concentrations in any of the contaminated schools (mean values of all groups: PCB 138 = 0.66, 153 = 0.95, 180 = 0.70 microg/l blood). The results of blood analyses and additional toxicokinetic calculations suggested that inhalative PCB-uptake in the most contaminated schools caused a minor increase above mean background-PCB concentrations in blood. In conclusion, despite high PCB indoor air levels in schools, there was only a moderate increase in blood concentrations of teachers, mainly due to congeners with low chlorination (PCB 28 to PCB 101).
17051818	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) continue to be a worldwide public health concern due to their levels in the environment and humans, and associated adverse health effects. In animals, one of the most sensitive effects of physiologically significant body burdens has been the induction of cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) family of enzymes. This study examined the capacity of CYP1 enzyme induction to be a biomarker of exposure to a mixture of PCBs and PCDFs and of adverse human health effects. We followed a group of people highly exposed to PCBs and PCDFs due to accidental ingestion of contaminated rice oil, the Yucheng cohort. A total of 174 Yucheng and 134 control subjects were studied. The caffeine breath test, a monitor of CYP1A2 activity, was conducted, and its results were compared to serum levels of chemicals and the subjects' medical history. Total dioxin serum toxic equivalency (TEQ) in the Yucheng cohort and their controls were 577 +/- 393 ppt lipid and 21 ppt lipid, respectively. CYP1A2 activity was elevated in Yucheng subjects more than 2-fold and correlated with serum TEQ (R2= 0.62). Manifestations like chloracne, fingernail abnormalities, and headaches were well predicted by P4501A2 activity. It is concluded that CYP1A2 induction seen in the Yucheng cohort is an excellent biomarker of exposure and human health effects in individual subjects and cohort.
18950754	A variety of environmentally persistent contaminants of the Great Lakes Basin are able to bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain and pose a threat to the health and reproductive success of people and wildlife that depend on locally caught fish as a source of dietary protein. Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (DDE) has been linked to higher rates of cancer, reproductive problems, and endocrine disorders. To investigate the effects of exposure to persistent contaminants of the Great Lakes Basin, the health departments of five Great Lakes states formed a health-assessment consortium. Between 1988 and 1994, the consortium collected demographic and fish consumption information from 2548 licensed charter boat captains, 182 anglers, and 1667 referents. Between 1994 and 1995, a subset of 619 participants in this study provided additional fish consumption information and donated blood samples that were analyzed for PCBs and DDE. Follow-up studies conducted between 2001 and 2005 re-assessed fish consumption rates and blood levels of PCBs and DDE in 293 of these individuals. While there was a trend for increasing overall fish consumption among most participant groups, sportfish and Great Lakes sportfish consumption decreased significantly in the captains over the study period. Serum DDE concentrations, which were highest in men in the captain and angler groups, declined in 90% of study participants. Mean DDE levels fell from 5.6 to 3.2 microg/L. Total PCB levels declined in 80% of participants with the mean concentration falling from 4.2 to 2.8 microg/L. Annual declines in serum DDE and PCB concentrations averaged 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.
11824816	An new method for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in serum samples of up to 1 ml has been developed. The procedure consisted in the solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the analytes on an Oasis cartridge and the subsequent on-line elimination of the fat by directly dropping of the eluate from the SPE cartridge on a multilayer column placed below the cartridge. This configuration allowed minimising of the sample manipulation as well as the time, solvent and sorbent consumption (i.e. complete sample preparation can be accomplished in about 1 h with only 3 ml of toluene and 300 mg of silica). The SPE plus clean-up method developed showed a satisfactory performance for the analysis of PCBs in rat serum samples providing similar recoveries (i.e. range 73-128% for most of the congeners selected) at the different spiking levels investigated (1.25, 0.50 and 0.25 ng/ml). Detection limits using a microelectron capture detector were in the range 0.01-0.30 ng/ml of serum and the relative standard deviations of the complete method better than 18% irrespective of the PCB concentration. The validated method has been applied to the evaluation for the first time of the PCB levels in serum samples of up to 1 ml from individuals of an Egyptian Vulture colony in Spain.
11437459	The identification of host factors that are predictors of changes in serum polyhalogenated biphenyl contaminants over time has been a difficult challenge in epidemiologic studies of exposed individuals. Of particular concern are age at exposure, reproductive and lactational histories, and changes in body mass index. Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches, this study examined factors related to high initial serum PBB and PCB levels and changes in these levels over time among women of varying ages at exposure (n=1772; age range<1 to 45 years). In 1973, PBB exposure occurred through consumption of farm products contaminated with PBB added to cattle feed. Exposures to PCBs began in 1941 through PCB-contaminated silo sealant deteriorating into animal feed. The Michigan Department of Public Health began enrolling participants in 1977 and has continued to follow them through annual updates. At enrollment, questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric measurements, medical/reproductive and occupational histories, and contaminated food consumption patterns. Blood samples were collected for PBB and PCB analysis at enrollment for all participants; additional serum tests were done on a subset of the population during follow-up. Median serum levels at enrollment were 2.0 ppb PBB and 5.0 ppb PCB. A decline in serum PBB level over an interval that ranged from 1 to 146 months (median=31) was observed for 44.6% of the women (median=1.0 ppb), while 12.2% showed an increase (median=1.0 ppb). PCB levels declined in 50.3% of the women (median=3.0 ppb) while 12.2% increased (median=2.0 ppb). Relative to women whose contaminant levels were stable, higher initial serum level was a predictor of decline for both PBB and PCB (OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.52-1.82; OR=3.26, 95% CI 2.58-4.12, respectively); a yearly increase in interval between tests was related to declining PCBs (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.46-1.87). In addition, age< or =10 years at exposure (OR=1.72, 95% CI 1.03-2.86) and residence on a quarantined farm (OR=1.40, 95- CI 1.03-1.90) were predictors of a decrease in PBBs. Factors related to an increase in PBB levels were age< or =10 years at exposure (OR=0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.96) and initial PBB level (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.33); and for PCBs, high initial level (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) and body mass index (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13). One or more live births during the interval between tests were not related to changing levels of either contaminant; breastfeeding data were not available for examination. Early age at exposure appears to be an important predictor of changes in serum PBB levels over time.
16835064	We assessed determinants of cord serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels among 720 infants born between 1993 and 1998 to mothers living near a PCB-contaminated Superfund site in Massachusetts, measuring the sum of 51 PCB congeners (capital sigmaPCB) and ascertaining maternal address, diet, sociodemographics, and exposure risk factors. Addresses were geocoded to obtain distance to the Superfund site and neighborhood characteristics. We modeled log10(capital sigmaPCB) as a function of potential individual and neighborhood risk factors, mapping model residuals to assess spatial correlates of PCB exposure. Similar analyses were performed for light (mono-tetra) and heavy (penta-deca) PCBs to assess potential differences in exposure pathways as a function of relative volatility. PCB-118 (relatively prevalent in site sediments and cord serum) was assessed separately. The geometric mean of capital sigmaPCB levels was 0.40 (range, 0.068-18.14) ng/g serum. Maternal age and birthplace were the strongest predictors of capital sigmaPCB levels. Maternal consumption of organ meat and local dairy products was associated with higher and smoking and previous lactation with lower capital sigmaPCB levels. Infants born later in the study had lower capital sigmaPCB levels, likely due to temporal declines in exposure and site remediation in 1994-1995. No association was found between capital sigmaPCB levels and residential distance from the Superfund site. Similar results were found with light and heavy PCBs and PCB-118. Previously reported demographic (age) and other (lactation, smoking, diet) correlates of PCB exposure, as well as local factors (consumption of local dairy products and Superfund site dredging) but not residential proximity to the site, were important determinants of cord serum PCB levels in the study community.
10092416	Dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic, persist in the environment, and bioaccumulate to concentrations that can be harmful to humans. Sport anglers may be exposed to these residues via consumption of contaminated Great Lakes (GL) fish. The Health Departments of five GL states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana, formed a consortium to study body burden levels of chemical residues in fish consumers of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. In Fall 1993, a telephone survey was administered to sport angler households to obtain fish consumption habits and demographics. A blood sample was obtained from a portion of the study subjects. One hundred serum samples were analyzed for 8 dioxin, 10 furan, and 4 coplanar PCB congeners. Multiple linear regression was conducted to assess the predictability of the following covariates: GL sport fish species, age, BMI, gender, years sport fish consumed, and lake. Of the 100 subjects, there were 58 men; 35 consumed sport fish from Lake Michigan, 29 from Lake Huron, and 36 from Lake Erie. The overall average number of GL sport fish meals consumed in the previous 12 months was 43. Lake Erie male and female consumers, on average, ate more GL sport fish, a mean of 57 and 42 meals, respectively, than men and women from the other two lake subgroups. Median total dioxin toxic equivalents (TEq), total furan TEq, and total coplanar PCB TEq were higher among all men than all women (P=0.0001). Lake trout, salmon, age, BMI, and gender were significant regression predictors of log(total coplanar PCBs). Lake trout, age, gender, and lake were significant regression predictors of log(total furans). Age was the only significant predictor of total dioxin levels.
12963397	In order to determine the effect of perinatal polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofurans (PCBs/PCDFs) exposure on neonatal and childhood teeth in Yucheng children, we carried out complete dental examinations on 73 Yucheng children born to mothers who ingested high levels of PCBs/PCDFs and 75 matched controls, aged 7-11 years, in 1992. Ten of 73 (10%) exposed children were reported to have borne teeth during the neonatal period, while none of the controls did. The exposed group also had a significantly higher percentage of teeth with congenitally missing tooth germ compared to the controls (29 vs 2.7%) or rotation (19 vs 2.7%). The percentages of developmental defects increased significantly with increasing maternal serum PCB levels, childhood PCB and PCDF levels, and the duration of breast feeding. The maternal PCB level clearly played a more important role in an increased risk of neonatal teeth and developmental defects. The defects were apparent from the lowest tertile, with a total PCB level of <10 ppb in maternal serum measured nearest to childbirth. The number of permanent teeth tended to be less in exposed children than in the control group from the age of 11 years onwards. Our present study has demonstrated for the first time a dose-response relationship between perinatal PCBs/PCDFs exposure and dental defects.
12660360	Effects of a commercial polychlorinated biphenyls mixture, Kanechlor-500 (KC500), on the levels of serum thyroid hormones such as total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were examined comparatively in male Wistar rats and ddy mice. Serum T4 levels were significantly decreased in both rats and mice 4 days after a single ip injection of KC500 (100 mg/kg body weight), whereas decreased levels of T3 were observed in mice but not in rats. In addition, no significant change in the level of serum thyroid stimulating hormone was observed in either rats or mice. Hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UDP-GTs) UGT1A1 and UGT1A6, which efficiently mediate glucuronidation of T4 and promote the excretion of the hormones, were induced by KC500 in rats but not in mice. Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) content and the microsomal activity for 7-ethoxy-, 7-pentoxy-, and 7-benzoyloxy-resorufin dealkylations were significantly increased by KC500 in both rats and mice, although the magnitude of increase in the enzyme activities was higher in rats than in mice. The difference in the increase in the activity of microsomal enzymes, including UDP-GT and P450, between KC500-treated rats and mice was not correlated with that in the level of hepatic methylsulfonyl-PCB metabolites. In the present study, we found for the first time that the decrease in serum T4 levels by KC-500 in mice occurred without increase in hepatic UDP-GTs, UGT1A1 and UGT1A6, responsible for T4 glucuronidation. The present findings further suggested that although the decrease in serum T4 levels in KC500-treated rats would occur at least in part through the induction of the UDP-GTs, it might not be dependent on only the increase in the enzymes.
8924587	The purpose of this study was to determine whether lower chlorinated biphenyls would be bioactivated to electrophilic metabolites by microsomes alone or in combination with peroxidase. Monochloro- and dichlorobiphenyls were incubated with liver microsomes of rats treated with phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone, an NADPH-regenerating system, and deoxyguanosine 3'-monophosphate (dGp). The resultant adducts were analyzed by 32P-postlabeling either following microsomal incubation alone ("preoxidized") or coupled with subsequent oxidation with horseradish peroxidase/H2O ("oxidized"). The incubation of 4-monochlorobiphenyl (4-MCB) resulted in the formation of two minor adducts by microsomal activation alone. However, the oxidized sample showed two additional major adducts. Formation of the latter adducts was almost completely (> 80%) inhibited when the oxidation reaction was performed in the presence of ascorbic acid. The other test mono- and dichlorobiphenyls also formed 1-3 major adducts. Compared with microsomal activation alone, these adducts were enhanced after the oxidation reaction or detected only in the oxidized samples. These data suggest that (1) some adducts of the lower chlorinated biphenyls are derived from arene oxides and (2) many adducts may be formed by metabolism of the parent compounds to catechol and p-hydroquinone species, which are oxidized to semiquinones and/or quinones. The involvement of quinones and/or semiquinones was supported by UV/vis spectroscopic measurements, which showed that metabolites of 4-MCB can be oxidized to products with spectra characteristic of quinones. These data raise the possibility that lower chlorinated biphenyls may be genotoxic and may explain the fact that commercial polychlorinated biphenyl mixtures are complete rodent carcinogens.
21030064	In order to assess potential risks of exposure to environmental chemicals, more information on concomitant exposure to different chemicals is needed. We present data on chemicals in human milk of a cohort study (2004, 2005, 2006) of 54 mother/child pairs, where for the first time, cosmetic UV filters, synthetic musks, parabens and phthalate metabolites were analyzed in the same sample along with persistent organochlor pollutants (POPs), i.e., organochlor pesticides and metabolites, polybrominated diphenylethers and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The two groups of chemicals exhibited different exposure patterns. Six out of seven PCB congeners and a majority of pesticides were present in all milk samples, with significant correlations between certain PCB congener and pesticide levels, whereas the cosmetic-derived compounds, UV filters, parabens and synthetic musks, exhibited a more variable exposure pattern with inter-individual differences. UV filters were present in 85.2% of milk samples, in the range of PCB levels. Comparison with a questionnaire revealed a significant correlation between use of products containing UV filters and their presence in milk for two frequently used and detected UV filters, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octocrylene, and for the whole group of UV filters. Concentrations of PCBs and organochlor pesticides were within ranges seen in Western and Southern European countries. For several POPs, mean and/or maximum daily intake calculated from individual concentrations was above recent US EPA reference dose values. Our data emphasize the need for analyses of complex mixtures to obtain more information on inter-individual and temporal variability of human exposure to different types of chemicals.
9204098	OBJECTIVE: This paper describes an exposure assessment of an American Indian population using blood and hair samples as indicators of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl exposure from the consumption of fish taken from the Great Lakes region. METHODS: Questionnaires regarding fish consumption were completed by 89 Ojibwa tribal members. Mercury concentrations were determined in human hair and blood samples, and polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations were determined in serum. RESULTS: Fish were consumed at the highest rates in April, May, June, and July. Lake trout, whitefish, and walleye were the preferred fish consumed by 91.4% of the respondents. Concentrations of blood mercury were all below 55 micrograms/L (ppb), while concentrations of mercury in hair were all less than 3 mg/L (ppm). Hair mercury concentrations were correlated with the previous year's fish consumption (p = .05). Dental amalgams and blood mercury concentrations were also significantly correlated (p < .002). Serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations, determined as the sum of 89 congeners, were all below 9.6 ppb total polychlorinated biphenyls. Subject age and total serum polychlorinated biphenyls were correlated (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls in this Ojibwa population were relatively low, but several individuals were identified as having elevated concentrations and additional testing may be warranted. Since the accumulation of contaminants was related to fish consumption and age, a long-term monitoring program that assesses chronic exposure to fish diets would be beneficial. 
22750179	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are synthetic organochlorine compounds with potential neurotoxic effects. Although negative effects on neuropsychological development have been observed in previous studies on PCB exposure, there are inconsistencies in these effects at current exposure levels of these compounds which are much lower than for previous generations. This study aimed to disentangle the effects of prenatal and postnatal PCB exposure on neuropsychological development at 4 years of age. This study is based on a population-based birth cohort design established in Menorca (Spain) as part of the INMA [Environment and Childhood] Project. We assessed general neuropsychological development using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MCSA). A total of 422 4-year old children were assessed with the MCSA. Levels of PCBs were measured in cord blood (n=405) and in blood samples taken at 4 years (n=285). We found no statistically significant effects of the sum of prenatal PCBs on MCSA scores. Nevertheless, individual congener analyses yielded significant detrimental effects of prenatal PCB153 on the majority of MCSA scores, while no effects were reported for other congeners. The levels of PCBs at 4 years of age were not associated with neuropsychological development. Thus, prenatal exposure to low-level concentrations of PCBs, particularly PCB153, was associated with an overall deleterious effect on neuropsychological development at 4 years of age, including negative effects on executive function, verbal functions and visuospatial abilities, but not on motor development.
21376977	We describe a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the simultaneous determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sheep serum samples. The denaturation of serum proteins by formic acid, water-1-propanol and water-2-propanol were compared and optimized. Seven different solid-phase sorbents were tested and it was found that Strata-X cartridge (200mg, 6 mL) gave the best recoveries (92-106%, SD<6%, n=3) for all the target analytes. The different extraction solvents (iso-hexane and dichloromethane), either alone or in combination, were used to extract these persistent organic compounds from spiked serum samples by SPE. Removal of co-extracted biogenic materials was achieved using adsorption chromatography with acid modified silica and activated silica. Iso-hexane was found to be the most appropriate solvent for clean-up providing good recoveries and clear chromatographic separation; its use is preferable to that of DCM because it is less environmentally toxic. The limits of detection (LOD) of the proposed method were 47-105 pg g(-1) and 16-24 pg g(-1) for the different PBDEs and PCBs studied, respectively. The developed method was linear over the range from 0.05 to 30 ng g(-1), for all PBDEs except PBDE 183 (0.10-30 ng g(-1)), and from 0.02 to 30 ng g(-1) for all tested PCB congeners. The established method was successfully applied to sheep serum samples from Scotland, UK, for the determination of the target PBDEs and PCBs.
11375377	OBJECTIVE: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants that are ubiquitous in the food chain; detectable amounts are in the blood of nearly everyone. Their effect on humans at background levels of exposure is an area of active investigation. Increased blood levels of dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), a PCB-like compound, have recently been reported among subjects with diabetes, suggesting that PCB levels could be similarly elevated. To test this hypothesis, we examined a group of pregnant women whose serum PCB levels had been measured and whose diabetes status had been previously recorded. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using stored serum from a large birth cohort study, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,245 pregnant women, of whom 44 had diabetes (primarily type 1) and 2,201 were control subjects. RESULTS: The adjusted mean serum level of PCBs among the subjects with diabetes was 30% higher than in the control subjects (P = 0.0002), and the relationship of PCB level to adjusted odds of diabetes was linear. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility exists that PCBs and diabetes are causality related; alternatively, the pharmacokinetics of PCBs could be altered among patients with diabetes. At any event, if the association is replicated in other studies, increased serum levels of PCBs in subjects with diabetes or their offspring may put them at increased risk of PCB-induced changes in thyroid metabolism or neurodevelopment. 
8907234	Blood-fat concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners: no. 105, 118, 156 (mono-ortho-substituted) and no. 77, 126, 169 (non-ortho-substituted) and PCB congeners no. 28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180 were measured. The investigations were carried out in pooled samples from children and in individual samples from adults. Additionally polychloro-p-dibenzodioxins and -furans (PCDD/PCDF) were investigated.
14555402	Agent Orange, a phenoxyherbicide contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was used by American military forces during the United States-Vietnam war between 1962 and 1971 primarily as a defoliant to destroy forests where enemy troops might find cover. Agent Orange was used mainly in Vietnam, but also to a lesser extent in Laos and Cambodia. In Laos, there have been no prior studies of TCDD contamination from Agent Orange, despite known defoliation and documented records of Agent Orange spraying. This article presents findings of TCDD in human blood and milk from two geographic areas in Laos: Vientiane, a nonsprayed area, and Sepone, an Agent Orange-sprayed area. German and Canadian laboratories used high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure 7 dioxin, 10 dibenzofuran, and 4 non-ortho or coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in Laotian blood and milk samples. Most subjects tested in this Laos Ministry of Health Study showed low dioxin and dibenzofuran levels, consistent with what would be expected in a primarily rural nonindustrial country. These findings are consistent with relatively low dioxin and dibenzofuran levels recently found in food from these same areas. The chemically and toxicologically related non-ortho PCBs were measured but were found at low levels compared to specimens from other countries, presumably because of less industrialization and industrial pollution in Laos.
20654485	Hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) bind the oestrogen receptor (ER) and increase uterine weight in animal models. This oestrogenic action of PCB metabolites is of putative human health concern. We have thus developed a system to study human in vitro PCB metabolism. Human liver microsomes produced PCB metabolites in an NADPH-dependent microsomal reaction mixture (MRM); the metabolites were tested for ER-binding affinity in the human recombinant oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER) competitive binding assay. These metabolites were identified using HPLC by comparing the retention times with known PCB-metabolites. 2,4,6-Trichlorobiphenyl (246BP) was used as a prototype to standardize this method. 246BP up to a concentration of 50 mum did not bind to ER, but 246BP-MRM competed for binding to ER; it competed for 75% of (3)H-estradiol-17beta ((3)H-E(2)) binding to ER. The ER-binding component of the 246BP-MRM had a retention time identical to that of 4'OH-246BP using HPLC. This method provides a rapid screen for the qualitative assessment of the presence of microsomally-generated ER-binding PCB metabolites to guide further characterization of these compounds by GC/MS analysis.
16736058	A study was conducted to address the question of how fish consumption, occupation, and outdoor air affected serum PCB concentrations and congener patterns among 139 Native American men living near three hazardous waste sites. They were interviewed about their residential, occupational, and dietary histories, and donated 20 ml of venous blood for congener-specific PCB analysis. The similarity in the congener pattern between that found in the serum and that detected in local environmental samples was measured by calculating the Euclidean distance between them. The results indicated that serum PCB concentrations were positively associated with cumulative lifetime exposures to PCBs from local fish consumption and occupation. However, participants who lived in the last 10 years at Raquette Point, which is the area of the Reserve closest to the hazardous waste sites and the only location where elevated levels of PCBs were found in outdoor air, did not have higher serum PCB concentrations than participants who lived elsewhere at Akwesasne. Regarding pattern matching, Mohawk men with the greatest cumulative lifetime exposure to PCBs from local fish consumption had a serum PCB congener pattern that more closely resembled that in fish caught off-shore from one of the hazardous waste sites than did men who ate less local fish. Similarly, Mohawk men who were occupationally exposed to PCBs were more likely than those without occupational exposure to have a serum PCB congener pattern that was similar to that of Aroclor 1248, the commercial PCB mixture used locally. The serum PCB congener pattern of Raquette Point residents more closely resembled the pattern in outdoor air only if the men ate relatively few local fish. The study is among the first to demonstrate that outdoor air may affect serum PCB congener patterns, at least in the absence of heavy fish consumption.
17125836	Risk assessment of pollutants requires both monitoring studies in the field and experimental exposure studies. In this study, we evaluated silastic implants as an alternative method of exposure for use in toxicological studies and at the same time evaluated the usefulness of feathers as a non-destructive biomonitor for PCBs. European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were exposed to different doses (including a control group) of environmentally relevant concentrations of PCB 153 during a 15-week period using silastic implants with both ends/only one end sealed. After implantation, there was a rapid and significant increase in PCB 153 blood concentration in the exposed groups. The significant differences in blood concentrations among the treatment groups show that silastic implants are useful as a method of exposure. Moreover, the ratio between the tissue concentrations of two treatment groups reflected the difference in implantation doses between these groups. There was also a clear difference in tissue concentrations among the treatment groups, although we could not test this statistically due to the small sample sizes. The slow release kinetics for a prolonged period and the relatively stable blood concentrations during the 15-week period render silastic tubes very interesting to study the effects of chronic exposure to pollutants. Our results also revealed that sealing both ends of the implant instead of only one did not significantly affect the exposure. There were strong, significant positive correlations between the blood and the tissues, which confirm the use of blood to monitor PCBs. To evaluate the usefulness of feathers as a non-destructive biomonitor for PCBs, we plucked the original and newly grown wing and tail feathers. We observed strong, significant positive correlations between the concentrations in the newly grown feathers and concentrations in the muscle, liver, brain and blood. PCB 153 concentrations in the newly grown feathers differed among the treatment groups. To our knowledge, our results provide the first experimental evidence that feathers are useful as a non-destructive biomonitoring tool for PCBs.
15979066	Great Lakes (GL) sport fish consumption is a potential route of exposure for environmentally persistent organochlorine contaminants, which may have human health effects. In this report, relationships are explored among individual congeners in a large cohort of frequent and infrequent GL sport fish consumers. Blood samples were obtained in 1993-1995 and analyzed for 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (DDE) and for 62 noncoplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 4 coplanar PCBs, 8 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin), and10 dibenzofuran (furan) congeners. All GL fish eaters and referents had detectable levels of DDE, total noncoplanar PCBs, total coplanar PCBs, total dioxins, and total furans. Noncoplanar PCBs were higher in GL sport fish consumers than in a referent population from the same geographic area, were associated with GL sport-caught fish (GLSCF) consumption, and varied significantly by Great Lake. DDE, lower chlorinated dioxin and furan toxic equivalents (TEQs), and coplanar PCB TEQs were positively associated with noncoplanar PCBs but were not associated with GL sport fish consumption independent of PCB level. Highly chlorinated dioxin and furan congener TEQs were not significantly associated with noncoplanar PCBs or GL sport fish consumption, suggesting that participants were acquiring some of these TEQs from a source other than GLSCF. In epidemiologic studies, it may be important to include populations with higher organochlorine exposures as well as background exposures and to consider the effects of individual congeners or mixtures of congeners on health outcomes.
2494094	The concentrations of individual PCB's were determined in both serum and adipose tissue lipid from 35 transformer repair workers currently exposed to PCBs, mainly Aroclor 1260, 17 previous transformer repair workers, and 56 comparison workers never occupationally exposed to PCBs. The analysis used fused-silica capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detector (FSCGC/ECD) and FSCGC with negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry to verify PCB congener levels. Eighty-nine PCB peaks were identified and confirmed. More congeners were detected in adipose tissue. In serum approximately 50% of peaks were below the level of detection. Statistical techniques to account for left and interval censoring allowed comparison of concentration distributions even where data were incomplete. We found that unquantifiable levels were unlikely to contribute substantially to the true values for total [PCBs] over and beyond the contribution of the measured values. However, the total serum [PCBs] determined by FSCGC/ECD greatly exceeded that from standard packed cell gas chromatography (PCGC/ECD). The underestimation was less marked for adipose samples. In serum the total [PCBs] was highest in currently exposed workers and lowest in unexposed workers, with past-exposed workers clearly intermediate. In adipose tissue [PCBs] in the currently exposed group was much higher than in the other two groups, in whom the distribution of results was broadly similar. In all worker groups hexachlorinated and heptachlorinated species predominated followed by octachlorinated and pentachlorinated. The relative distribution of individual PCB congeners in the three groups was similar although the amounts varied. The seven major peaks in serum and adipose tissue were 2,3,5,6,3',4',5'/2,3,4,5,2',4',5' hepta-CB; 2,3,4,2',3',5' hexa-CB; 2,4,6,3',4',5'/2,4,5,2',4',5'/2,3,4,5,2',5' hexa-CB; 2,3,4,5,2',3',4' hepta-CB; 2,3,4,5,2',3',5',6'/2,3,4,5,6,2',3',5', octa-CB; 2,4,5,3',4',/3,4,5,2',3' penta-CB; and 2,3,4,2',3',4'/2,3,5,6,2',4',5'/2,3,4,5,2',4',6' multi-CB. The distribution of PCB peaks in our populations differs from that in capacitor workers (exposed to less highly chlorinated PCBs) and from Yu-Cheng patients suggesting differing toxic potentials from PCBs in these three circumstances.
1904915	The effects of dietary supplementation of methionine to a 20% soybean protein isolate diet on serum lipoprotein profiles and secretion rate of VLDL in rats receiving polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were investigated. Serum cholesterol levels were higher in rats fed PCB or a methionine supplement than in controls. The effects of PCB and methionine were synergistic. The feeding of PCB resulted in more cholesterol in all fractions of serum lipoproteins tested, especially HDL (HDL1 and HDL2). Dietary supplementation of methionine primarily increased HDL cholesterol. The elevation of serum lipoprotein cholesterol due to PCB and/or methionine was significant in HDL1, which showed alpha-mobility. These results showed that methionine and PCB significantly influenced HDL metabolism. The secretion rate of VLDL was higher in rats fed PCB than in controls, but the addition of methionine to diets did not affect the secretion rate of VLDL cholesterol. This implies that PCB increased serum cholesterol partly through the stimulation of VLDL cholesterol secretion.
22275729	BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported an association between higher maternal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations and smaller thymus volume in newborns in a birth cohort residing in eastern Slovakia. OBJECTIVE: In the present report we address whether thymus volume at later ages is influenced by prenatal and early postnatal PCB exposure. METHODS: At the time of delivery, 1,134 mother-infant pairs were enrolled. Maternal and 6- and 16-month infant blood samples were collected and analyzed for 15 PCB congeners. Thymus volume was measured in infants shortly after birth and at ages 6 and 16 months using ultrasonography. RESULTS: Higher maternal PCB concentration was associated with reduced thymus volume at birth [a 0.21 SD reduction in thymus volume for an increase in total maternal PCB concentration from the 10th to the 90th percentile; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.37, -0.05], whereas maternal PCB concentration was not predictive of 6- and 16-month thymus volume. Six-month infant PCB concentration was associated with a 0.40 SD decrease in 6-month thymus volume (95% CI: -0.76, -0.04). There was also some suggestion that thymus volume at 16 months was positively associated with concurrent infant PCB concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The potential adverse effects of in utero PCB exposure on thymic development may extend beyond the neonatal period. Results from this highly exposed cohort provide suggestive evidence that postnatal PCB concentrations may be influential, but a smaller set of 6-month PCB measurements limited statistical power at that time point. Implications regarding impaired immunologic maturation or long-term clinical implications remain to be determined. 
22704218	Blood serum specimens from 81 non-occupationally exposed adults residing in four areas close to municipal and waste incinerators as well as metallurgical industry plant and 44 adult subjects coming from control area of Slovakia were analysed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs). The concentration of total WHO(98)TEQ PCDD/F/dl-PCBs in whole group of donors from areas where known sources causing dioxin contamination are present was significantly higher than in control group of donors (p<0.001). Correlation between the age of donors and PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels was confirmed (Spearman's r(PCDD/Fs)=0.543, r(dl-PCBs)=0.521, p<0.001). Furthermore, this study presents first results concerning the PBDE congeners in human serum of Slovak general population. The total concentration (congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) in control group was approximately 1.5-times higher in comparison to that of residents coming from areas with supposed environmental pollution. The most abundant congeners in all samples were BDE-47 and BDE-153 with median values of 0.24 ng g(-1) lipid and 0.23ngg(-1) lipid, respectively. The positive association between PBDE values and age of donors was not found.
14620819	Space-use was examined in 54 female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard and the Barents Sea that were collared with satellite transmitters to provide information on their spatial positions and annual home range sizes. Plasma samples from the same animals were analyzed for concentrations of six relevant PCB congeners (PCB-99, -153, -156, -180, -194, and -118). Factors related to space-use strategy (such as home range size; annual, spring, and winter longitudinal position; and spring and summer latitudinal position) were important determinants of PCB concentrations in plasma. In addition, reproductive status of the polar bears and plasma lipid content affected PCB concentrations. Among the tested variables, annual home range size was the variable that affected sigmaPCB5 (sum of PCB-99, -153, -156, -180, and -194) to the largest degree (r2 = 0.22). We propose that the positive effect of home range size on sigmaPCB5 in female polar bears is related to the higher energetic costs required to occupy large home range sizes as compared to small home range sizes. Polar bears with large home range sizes would need to consume more prey than bears with small home range sizes, and increased feeding without a change in elimination of persistent compounds can explain their higher sigmaPCB5 concentrations. Polar bears with large home range sizes were also more pelagic, inhabiting areas further east, closer to the ice-edge zone than animals with small home range sizes. Thus, prey choice associated with a pelagic space-use strategy may also explain the higher sigmaPCB5 in polar bears with large home range sizes.
11748036	Previous studies have suggested that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may alter thyroid function, but data on effects of PCB exposure on other endogenous hormones has been lacking. The current study is ancillary to a larger investigation of the effects of Great Lakes fish consumption on PCBs and reproductive function. In the current study we examine associations of PCBs, 1,1-bis (4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (DDE), and fish consumption with thyroid and steroid hormones in 178 men and PCBs, DDE, and fish consumption with thyroid hormones in 51 women from the original study. Serum PCB level and consumption of Great Lakes fish are associated with significantly lower levels of thyroxine (T(4)) and free thyroxine index (FTI) in women and with significantly lower levels of T(4) in men. Fish consumption, but not PCB level, is significantly and inversely associated with triiodothyronine (T(3)) in men. Results for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are inconsistent. Among men, there are significant inverse associations of both PCB and fish consumption with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound testosterone, but no association with SHBG or free testosterone. There are no significant overall associations of PCB, DDE, or fish consumption with estrone sulfate, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The results of this study are consistent with previous studies showing effects of fish consumption and PCB exposure on thyroid hormones and suggest that PCBs may also decrease steroid binding to SHBG. Elucidation of specific mechanisms must await future investigations.
10713469	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are metabolized by hydroxylation; some of these hydroxylated metabolites exhibit estrogen-like activity in animal models. Because PCBs may have effects on human health, it is of interest to determine if human tissues also metabolize PCBs to potentially estrogenic metabolites. In this study metabolites of seven PCBs with different degrees and positions of chlorination, generated by human liver microsomal reaction mixtures (MRM) have been examined, and their affinity for human recombinant estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) has been tested before and after HPLC fractionation. Two of the three MRMs with di-chloro-biphenyls (BPs, 2,5BP and 3,4BP), one of the three MRMs with tetra-BPs (2,6,2',6'BP), and one hexa-BP (2,4,6,2',4',6'BP) generated metabolites that competed for ER. HPLC of the ER-binding MRMs generated fractions that also exhibited ER-binding. This study shows the usefulness of combining in vitro metabolism and an ER-binding assay in initial identification of PCBs with estrogen-modulating potential.
18991912	PCB levels in environmental, food, and human samples were determined around a highly PCB-contaminated town (F town), a less contaminated town (P town), and a control town (DXG). There were significant differences in PCB concentrations in the intravenous blood of the mothers and their children living in F, P, and DXG sites. In F town, PCB concentrations in the blood of the mothers averaged 190 mug/kg lipid, as compared to 97 mug/kg lipid in the control site. PCB concentrations in the blood of boys and girls averaged 222 and 153 mug/kg lipid, respectively, in F town. PCB concentrations in the umbilical cord blood averaged 566.8 and 168.2 mug/kg lipid, respectively, in the more seriously (F town) and less seriously (P town) polluted sites. Concentrations in the fetal excreta of the newborns averaged 100.06 and 1.66 mug/kg lipid, respectively, in these sites. PCBs were detected in surface water, underground water, soil, and vegetables, and have spread in a circumference of 30 km from the PCB source and have accumulated in the food chains from surface water to fish and duck eggs and from soil to chickens and pigs. The inhabitants have taken in PCBs through these foods since the 1970s. The results implicate the e-waste recycling operations as having caused elevated PCB levels in the environment and in humans. The elevated exposure levels may have health implications for the next generation.
10560775	There is evidence that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners have differential effects on endpoints of neurotoxicity depending on their chemical structure: specifically, that ortho-substituted congeners are neurotoxic while coplanar (dioxin-like) congeners are relatively inactive in producing neurotoxic effects. This study extends research on the effects of developmental exposure to the coplanar congener 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) in Long-Evans rats. Dams were dosed with 0, 0.25, or 1 microg/kg/day Monday to Friday beginning 5 weeks before and continuing through gestation and lactation. The first 2-week breeding period produced 10, 7, and 13 litters in the three dose groups, respectively, used in behavioral assessment. Breeding females from the control and low-dose group that did not conceive were rebred after 76 days of dosing, producing six and six litters used in behavioral testing. This regimen of PCB exposure produced reduced weight gain between birth and weaning in cohort 1, and decreased thyroxine levels and changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters in both cohorts. One female and male from each litter were tested under a series of three concurrent random interval-random interval (RI-RI) schedules of reinforcement beginning at about 400 days of age, followed immediately by assessment under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. The concurrent RI-RI allows assessment of performance during steady state and during behavior in transition (learning). The PR schedule provides the opportunity to assess the strength of the reinforcing event independent of response rate. During the first RI-RI schedule, the high-dose group apportioned responses less accurately than controls with respect to the scheduled relative reinforcement density on the two levers. There was also some evidence for differences in performance between treated and control groups on the third RI-RI schedule of reinforcement. There was no evidence for differences in the relative strength of the reinforcing event as assessed by PR performance. These same rats failed to exhibit PCB-induced impairment on a spatial delayed alternation task or under multiple fixed interval-fixed ratio or DRL schedules of reinforcement, performed prior to the current experiments. These data extend previous findings concerning the pattern of behavioral effects as a consequence of gestational and lactational exposure to a dioxin-like PCB congener.
21783857	The objective of this cross-sectional epidemiological study was to assess if long-term exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with hearing impairment. Four hundred and thirty-three children aged 8-9 years residing in an area polluted by PCBs in Eastern Slovakia were examined otoscopically, tympanometrically and by pure tone audiometry. PCB levels in their serum were determined by gas chromatography. Transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) were measured in a subgroup of 161 children. The mean of the sum of PCB concentrations in serum was 528.2ng/g serum lipids (median 321ng/g serum lipids). Serum PCB concentrations were associated with an increase of hearing threshold at low frequencies and a negative correlation between serum PCBs and the amplitude of TEOAE response was observed in the uppermost tertile of children grouped with regard to serum PCBs, not related to thyroid hormone levels. It was concluded that long-term environmental exposure to PCBs is associated with subclinical but diagnosable hearing deficits.
16309888	We recently reported that rats exposed to PCBs and MeHg during development were impaired on the rotating rod, a test of balance and coordination that is often indicative of cerebellar damage. In addition, developmental PCB exposure is known to dramatically reduce circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, which may have a negative impact on cerebellar development. Therefore, we investigated the effects of combined PCB and MeHg exposure on Purkinje cells and the cerebellum. The serum and brains from littermates of the animals tested on the rotating rod were collected at weaning, and we also collected brains from the adult animals at the end of motor testing. Four groups were studied: 1) vehicle controls, 2) PCBs only (Aroclor 1254, 6 mg/kg/d, oral), 3) MeHg only (0.5 ppm, in dams' drinking water), and 4) PCB+MeHg (at the same doses as in individual toxicant exposures). Female Long-Evans rats were exposed beginning 4 weeks prior to breeding with an unexposed male and continuing until postnatal day (PND) 16. There was a significant reduction in serum T4 and T3 concentrations in the PCB and PCB+MeHg pups on PND21. Golgi-impregnated Purkinje cells were examined in PND21 brains, but there were no significant exposure-related effects on primary dendrite length, branching area, or structural abnormalities. However, all three male exposure groups had a marginally significant increase in Purkinje cell height, which may suggest a subtle thyromimetic effect in the cerebellum. Cresyl-violet stained sections from the adult brains showed no exposure-related effects within paramedian lobule in Purkinje cell number, total lobule volume or layer volumes (molecular, granule cell and white matter layers). Evidence is provided for the dysregulation of expression of cerebellar ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoforms in PCB-exposed brains, and this could contribute to the rotating rod deficit by changing critical aspects of intracellular calcium signaling within the cerebellum.
11138670	In support of a study to relate developmental and cognitive effects with prenatal exposure to selected environmental toxicants, we developed and applied an analytical method to determine the concentration of two persistent pesticides, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and 32 specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in 316 umbilical cords taken in 1986-1987 from women of the Faroe Islands. The analytical method consisted of homogenization of the cords, partitioning, microsilica gel column chromatography for clean-up, and dual-column capillary gas chromatography (DB-5 and DB-1701) with electron capture detection. Several quality control parameters were followed to monitor the performance of the method. Important criteria used before reporting unknown data were the recovery of in vitro-spiked analytes from a bovine umbilical cord (BUC) and the percentage lipid obtained for a Certified Reference Material (CRM)-350 of mackerel oil (MO). Recoveries of analytes that had been spiked at two concentration ranges (0.26-0.95 ng/g whole weight; 0.35-2.42 ng/g whole weight) into bovine cords ranged from 38.5% to 158% and from 50.4% to 145%, respectively, with a median recovery of 77.7%. Measurement of the percentage lipid for CRM-350 ranged from 73.8% to 107% with a median lipid value of 96.0%. The most prevalent analytes detected (%) in unknown umbilical cords were HCB (100), DDE (100), Ballschmiter/Zell PCBs 153 (100), 138 (98), 180 (98), 170 (93), 118 (88), 187 (86), and 146 (83), with corresponding median concentrations (ng/g whole weight) of 0.17, 1.19, 0.38, 0.30, 0.17, 0.11, 0.12, 0.09, and 0.07, respectively. Total PCB--sum of all measurable PCB congeners--had a median concentration of 1.37 ng/g whole weight. The analytes, which were very low in lipid content were also quantified on a lipid-adjusted basis, which provided an analytical challenge in these umbilical cord samples. The gravimetrically measured lipids in the human specimens ranged from 0.01% to 1.43% (median of 0.18%). In the pooled BUCs, our lipid measurements varied from 0.05% to 0.33% with a median value of 0.13%. The utility of using the umbilical cord as a matrix to assess in utero exposure to persistent environmental pollutants, compared with the use of umbilical cord blood or mother's blood, is worthy of debate.
11192460	OBJECTIVE: Polychlorinated biphenyl congener profiles were examined in serum samples from 61 Native American (Ojibwa) volunteers who regularly consumed fish harvested from the Great Lakes region. A total of 93 peaks are reported which represent 126 individual chlorobiphenyls. RESULTS: When ranked by frequency, 13 peaks comprising single or co-eluting chlorobiphenyls occurred in all 61 samples (a frequency of 100%). These included chlorobiphenyls 138 + 158 + 163, 105 + 132 + 153, 180, 118, 196 + 203, 74, 182 + 187, 199, 183, 114 + 134, 195 + 208, 206, and 194. These 13 peaks also occurred at concentrations higher than those of all other measured chlorobiphenyls, except for the addition of the peak containing chlorobiphenyls 170 and 190, which was below detection in 15% of the samples and ranked fifth in average concentration. The highly chlorinated chlorobiphenyls resembled human serum profiles previously reported in the literature. METHODS: Individual chlorobiphenyls were identified using a gas chromatograph equipped with a 60-meter DB-5 capillary column and electron capture detection. CONCLUSION: When compared to other human residue analyses for fish-eating populations, the Ojibwa samples contained higher proportions of lightly chlorinated and labile chlorobiphenyls such as 8, 16 + 32, 17, 18, 25, 41 + 64 + 71, 33, 52, 110, and 129. These proportions were similar to those found in carp, whitefish, or whitefish livers harvested from the Great Lakes region. These data indicate that regular meals of lower trophic level fish, such as whitefish from the Great Lakes, may distort steady-state human chlorobiphenyl profiles with respect to certain lightly chlorinated or labile chlorobiphenyls. 
15583370	Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested that genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome P-450 1A1 gene (CYP1A1) may affect the relation between environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and breast cancer risk. The authors report results from a case-control study evaluating the potential effect of gene-environment interaction between CYP1A1 and serum PCB levels on breast cancer risk among Caucasian women in Connecticut. The study included 374 case women with histologically confirmed breast cancer and 406 noncancerous controls with information on both serum PCB level and CYP1A1 genotype (1999-2002). Compared with women who had the homozygous wild-type CYP1A1 m2 genotype, significantly increased risks of breast cancer were found for women with the CYP1A1 m2 variant genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 3.9), especially postmenopausal women (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.0). Risks associated with the CYP1A1 m2 variant genotype were highest for all women (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5, 8.2) and postmenopausal women (OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.6, 12.0) with higher serum PCB levels (611-2,600 ng/g). The CYP1A1 m1 and m4 genotypes were not associated with breast cancer risk independently or in combination with PCB exposure. In summary, the CYP1A1 m2 genetic polymorphism was associated with increased risk of female breast cancer and may modify the relation between PCB exposure and breast cancer risk.
17222440	Effects of perinatal exposure to dioxins, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides on lymphocyte subsets were investigated in the peripheral blood from 101 Japanese infants with approximately 10 months of age. Perinatal exposure to these organochlorine compounds were estimated by their contamination levels in the breast milk of the mothers. Lymphocyte subsets such as CD16+, HLA-DR+, CD4+, CD4+8+, CD8+, CD3+ and CD20+ cells in peripheral venous blood were assessed in a subgroup of 92 infants. Greater exposures to HCE, chlordane and dioxins were significantly associated with the increase in the percentages of CD8+ and CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios, respectively. In addition, higher HCH exposure was also associated with a decrease in the percentage of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore effects of dioxins, DDT and PCBs on the percentage of CD16+ T lymphocyte were more pronounced by the combined exposure of dioxins and PCBs or by the combined exposure of DDT and PCBs. Effects of HCE on the percentages of CD8+ T lymphocyte were also more pronounced by the combined exposure of HCE and chlordane. In conclusion, our study suggests that greater exposures to dioxins, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides determined in this study (except dieldrin) influence the immune system of Japanese infant, although the clinical significance of these changes is uncertain.
19819326	Research suggests that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may result in decreased child growth, though the critical window(s) are unclear. We investigated the association between PCBs and child size at age 24 months (n=44). PCBs were measured in first trimester serum, breast milk, and child serum at age 24 months, and dichotomized at the median. Age- and gender-specific z-scores were calculated for anthropometric measures. Using linear regression, we observed no significant changes in z-scores with prenatal or postnatal serum PCB concentrations. PCB-77 in breast milk was associated with a significant decrease in z-score for length. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine child size in relation to PCBs measured early in pregnancy, as well as quantifying a far greater number of congeners. Further research is needed to clarify critical windows, congener-specific effects, and effect modification by sex in relation to PCBs and child anthropometric measures.
21684538	There is an increasing body of literature showing associations of organochlorine exposure with risk of diabetes and insulin resistance. Some studies suggest that associations differ by gender and that diabetes risk, in turn, may be affected by endogenous steroid hormones. This report examines the relationships of serum PCBs and endogenous hormones with history of diabetes in a cohort of persons previously employed at a capacitor manufacturing plant. A total of 118 women were post-menopausal with complete data, of whom 93 were not using steroid hormones in 1996, at the time of examination, which included a survey of exposure and medical history, height, weight and collection of blood and urine for measurements of lipids, liver function, hematologic markers and endogenous hormones. This analysis examines relationships of serum polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), work exposure and endogenous hormones with self-reported history of diabetes after control for potential confounders. All PCB exposure groups were significantly related to history of diabetes, but not to insulin resistance as measured by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in non-diabetics. Diabetes was also independently and inversely associated with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and triiodothyronine (T3) uptake. HOMA-IR was positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and inversely associated with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and T3 uptake after control for PCB exposure. Possible biologic mechanisms are discussed. This study confirms previous reports relating PCB exposure to diabetes and suggests possible hormonal pathways deserving further exploration.
11514106	In 1999, a campaign of the Flemish Ministry of Health, Belgium was set up to assess pollutant concentrations and related health effect biomarkers in humans living in two regions of Flanders. The study was called the 'Flemish Environment and Health Study' (FLEHS). Concentrations of selected organochiorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and flirans (PCDF) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 47 pooled human serum samples originating from 200 individual women between 50 and 65 years living in two Flemish regions. The CALUX (Chemical-Activated Luciferase gene eXpression) bioassay was assessed on the same pools. The correlation between CALUX-TEQ and total TEQ (sum of PCDD/PCDF, non- and mono-ortho PCBs) varied from 0.43 to 0.73 for the rural and urban region, respectively. The mean value for the total TBQ (75 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat) was two times higher than the mean TEQ value determined with the CALUX bioassay (36 pg TEQ/g fat). This shows that the assessment of dioxin-like exposure by these two measurements was different. However, regional differences in concentrations were observed for neither total TEQs, nor CALUX-TEQs. It was concluded that the CALUX can be an alternative screening tool for biomonitoring purposes, especially when the objective is to compare different groups of people (e.g. living in different regions).
17234238	This study deals with a PCB, PCDD and PCDF contamination in Brescia, a city in the North-West of Italy, affecting an area with about 11000 inhabitants. The area is close to an industrial plant that produced, in total, some 31,000 ton of PCB. A relevant part of the polluted area is agricultural soil, where cattle were fed with polluted forage and farmers were consuming their own products, so that contamination led eventually to human exposure. Total levels of PCDD/Fs varied from 8 to 592 pgTE(WHO)/g for soil samples and when the dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) are included, the levels varied from 14.6 to 1033.7 pgTE(WHO)/g. In several cases, the legal limit was exceeded by more than one order of magnitude, with the highest contamination in some agricultural areas and in the surrounding zones. For the forage samples, total levels of PCDD/Fs varied from 0.29 to 2.04 pgTE(WHO)/g and, when dl-PCBs are included, this range increased from 2.04 to 4.75 pgTE(WHO)/g. PCB contamination of the forage through vapor condensation seemed to be relevant. The toxic contribution of dl-PCBs is always relevant and must be considered for risk management. The main component of the contamination source is probably a heavy PCB mixture, such as Aroclor 1262. The study dealt generally with the contamination transfer of PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs from soil up to humans across the food chain. Results on soils and forages are shown, while measurements concerning the contamination of the animals fed with contaminated forage, and the exposure of the farmers (through human serum analyses), as compared to general population, will be reported in a dedicated paper.
18768207	We conducted congener-specific analysis of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (non-dioxin-like PCBs) in blood collected in February 2004 from 127 elderly residents living in Nakagawa Town, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The present study is one of the few studies in which 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners were measured in human blood. Of the 127 elderly residents, 51 were men (mean: 68.1 years) and 76 were women (mean: 68.1 years). Among 197 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners, 56 were identified in the blood of elderly residents. The arithmetic mean total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners in the blood of elderly men and women in Nakagawa Town were 419 (median: 378) and 363 (median: 323)ngg(-1)lipid, respectively, and the concentrations were in the range of 172-1102 and 119-1226ngg(-1)lipid, respectively, indicating that the total concentrations in elderly men are significantly higher than those in elderly women. The contamination of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of elderly men and women in Fukuoka Prefecture was found to have decreased compared to past levels. The ratios of hexachlorinated biphenyls (hexaCBs) to the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners in the blood of elderly men and women were 44.6% and 45.6%, respectively, which was particularly high compared with those of other congeners. 2,2',4,4',5,5'-HexaCB (#153) among hexaCBs congeners, the most abundant congener in the blood of elderly men and women, contributed approximately 23.0% and 23.5% to the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners, respectively. Furthermore, 2,2',3,4,4',5'-hexaCB (#138), 2,3,3',4',5,6-hexaCB (#163)/2,3,3',4',5',6-hexaCB (#164), 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptaCB (#180), and 2,2',3,4,4',5,6'-heptaCB (#182)/2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptaCB (#187) also showed high ratios to the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners detected in the blood of elderly men and women. A statistical examination of the relationship between the total concentrations of 56 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners in blood and the age of elderly residents who were over 60 years indicated statistically significant correlations between the total concentrations of these PCBs congeners and the age of elderly women. However, similar correlations were not observed in elderly men. The results of the present study have indicated the current levels of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of elderly men and women in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan and can be used as baseline data for those over age 60.
19682390	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), a brominated flame retardant, was accidently mixed into animal feed in Michigan (1973-1974) resulting in human exposure through consumption of contaminated meat, milk and eggs. Beginning in 1976 individuals who consumed contaminated products were enrolled in the Michigan Long-Term PBB Study. This cohort presents a unique opportunity to study the association between parental exposures to PBB and offspring sex ratio. METHODS: We identified offspring of female PBB cohort participants (born 1975-1988) and obtained electronic birth records for those born in the state of Michigan. We linked this information to parental serum PBB and PCB concentrations collected at enrollment into the cohort. We modeled the odds of a male birth with generalized estimating equations accounting for the non-independence of siblings born to the same parents. We explored potential confounders: parental age and education at offspring's birth, parental body mass index at cohort enrollment, birth order, gestational age and year of offspring's birth. RESULTS: The overall proportion of male offspring among 865 live births to cohort mothers was 0.542. This was higher than the national male proportion of 0.514 (binomial test: p = 0.10). When both parents were in the cohort (n = 300), we found increased odds of a male birth with combined parents' enrollment PBB exposure > or = the median concentrations (3 microg/L for mothers; 6 microg/L for fathers) compared to combined parents' PBB exposure < the median concentrations (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.89-2.29), although this did not reach statistical significance. In addition, there was a suggestion of increased odds of a male birth for combined parents' enrollment PCB exposure > or = the median concentrations (6 microg/L for mothers; 8 microg/L for fathers) compared to combined parents' enrollment PCB exposure < the median concentrations (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 0.93-2.52). CONCLUSION: This study adds to the body of literature on secondary sex ratio and exposure to environmental contaminants. In this population, combined parental exposure to PBBs or PCBs increased the odds of a male birth. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings and shed light on the biological mechanisms by which these types of chemicals may influence the secondary sex ratio. 
22901373	BACKGROUND: The study was carried out in order to respond to public concern on the occupational exposure of metallurgical workers to highly toxic PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs in the area of the city of Brescia, northern Italy. OBJECTIVES: The study investigated the effects on the haematic burden of occupational exposures to the aforesaid contaminants in different work environments, attempting to establish causal relationships and providing indications for occupational health preventive measures. METHODS: Chemical concentrations were measured in blood serum of "professionally exposed" (PE) and "not professionally exposed" (NPE) subjects. NPE subjects included industrial administrative employees, Brescia inhabitants, and remote rural people. RESULTS: The central tendency indexes of contaminant cumulative concentrations were higher in PE than in NPE samples (for the mean values: PCDDs+PCDFs, 22.9 vs. 19.5 pgWHO-TEQ(1997)/g lb; DL-PCBs, 26.0 vs. 23.6 pgWHO-TEQ(1997)/g lb; PCDDs+PCDFs+DL-PCBs (TEQ(TOT)), 48.9 vs. 43.1 pgWHO-TEQ(1997)/g lb; Σ(6)[NDL-PCBs], 427 vs. 401 ng g(-1)lb); however, no statistical differences were detected at P=0.05. A significant difference for PCDDs+PCDFs and TEQ(TOT) was observed as the NPE data were progressively reduced to those of the remote rural people. The existence of a differential occupational exposure due to different environments was detected by applying the factor analysis to congener-specific data (analytical profiles). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that metallurgical workers may be exposed to PCDD, PCDF, and PCB more than the general population, in particular due to non-negligible contributions to exposure from workplace ambient air. Findings also suggest that an improvement of preventive measures may be required to avoid chemical overexposure in certain metallurgical workplaces. To identify exposure groups, the DL- and NDL-PCB analytical profiles seemed to be more sensitive to environmental exposure sources/pathways than those of PCDDs and PCDFs. 
16823523	From three locations along a 34-km shoreline of Pelee Island, Ontario, 30 gravid female Lake Erie water snakes (Nerodia sipedon insularum) were sampled to determine the organochlorine (OC) contaminant levels in plasma and the number of live and dead embryos present in the body cavity. Plasma was analyzed for 59 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 14 organochlorine pesticides. Concentrations of pesticides were low (< or =0.1 ng/g wet wt) in all snakes, but there was significant variation in mean PCB concentrations in plasma from among the sampling locations on Pelee Island. Snakes (n = 5) from the West shore and dock area of the island had significantly higher PCB concentrations (90.4 +/- 15.0 ng/g wet wt) in plasma than those from Lighthouse Point (n = 5; 34.4 +/- 13 ng/g wet wt) and the south shore of the island (n = 5; 29.4 +/- 16.3 ng/g wet wt). Body mass of the female snakes ranged from 252 to 880 g, and mean masses were not significantly different among sample sites. The number of live embryos found ranged from 13 to 46 female snakes and no dead embryos were detected. There were significant positive correlations among body mass, snout-vent length, and number of young per female. There were no significant correlations among body mass, snout-vent length, number of young per female, or per-gram body mass of female snakes and contaminant concentrations in plasma. It was concluded that an interim estimate of a no-effect level on embryonic survival in N. sipedon insularum may be a maximum average concentration of 90.4 ng/g wet wt PCBs and a maximum average concentration of 3.6 ng/g wet wt p,p'-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene in plasma.
1783595	An analytical method has been developed that uses electron capture/gas-liquid chromatography to determine Mirex in serum containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Aroclor 1260). With this method, 0.2 ppb Mirex can be determined in 4 mL serum that also contains 10 ppb PCBs. The method provides approximately 70% recovery of Mirex at 1.0 and 3.5 ppb. The coefficients of variation are 4.5 and 4.6% at 1.0 and 3.5 ppb, respectively. In a cooperative study with the Ohio Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control used this method to determine the extent of exposure of Salem, OH, residents to Mirex. Confirmation of Mirex was obtained by using high resolution gas chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry.
16620993	The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of chronic exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and methylmercury on visual brain processing in Inuit children from Nunavik (Northern Québec, Canada). Concentrations of total mercury in blood and PCB 153 in plasma had been measured at birth and they were again measured at the time of testing in 102 preschool aged children. Relationships between contaminants and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were assessed by multivariate regression analyses, taking into account several potential confounding variables. The possible protective effects of selenium and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids against methylmercury and PCB toxicity were also investigated. Results indicate that exposure to methylmercury and PCBs resulting from fish and sea mammal consumption were associated with alterations of VEP responses, especially for the latency of the N75 and of the P100 components. In contrast, the concomitant intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with a shorter latency of the P100. However, no significant interactions between nutrients and contaminants were found, contradicting the notion that these nutrients could afford protection against environmental neurotoxicants. Interestingly, significant associations were found with concentrations of neurotoxicants in blood samples collected at the time of testing, i.e. at the preschool age. Our findings suggest that VEP can be used as a valuable tool to assess the developmental neurotoxicity of environmental contaminants in fish-eating populations.
18958450	An increasing number of studies use blood obtained noninvasively to monitor organohalogen contaminants; however, blood can be difficult to analyze because of its aqueous nature and high protein content. We compared five methods for extracting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organochlorine pesticides, and lipids from serum using National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in Human Serum. Liquid:liquid (LLE), cavity-dispersed microwave-assisted (MAE), focused microwave-assisted (FME), solid-phase (SPE), and pressurized fluid (PFE) extraction techniques were compared. FME extraction yielded the optimal recovery of internal standards (IS). All methods resulted in similar contaminant concentrations that also agreed with the certified values for SRM 1589a, except for only a few compounds measured by methods other than FME. Based on these findings, the FME method was determined to be the best overall extraction method. One procedural factor was found to affect contaminant concentrations; use of IS carrier solvents that were immiscible with serum (or when the serum was not directly physically mixed with IS) resulted in a 30% underestimation of organohalogen concentrations. This study offers valid, novel extraction alternatives beyond traditional methods (e.g., LLE) for blood contaminant measurements.
8843560	Two prospective, longitudinal studies-one in North Carolina and one in Michigan-have examined effects of prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure on behavioral and cognitive development in infants and children. The Michigan cohort was selected to overrepresent the offspring of women who had eaten relatively large quantities of Lake Michigan fish; the North Carolina cohort was drawn from the general population. Both studies collected umbilical cord serum and maternal serum and milk samples. In both studies, the children were assessed at birth, during infancy, and during the preschool period, and multivariate statistical analysis was used to control for confounding. When exposure was assessed in terms of maternal body burden, effects were seen only in the most heavily exposed children: the top 3-5% of the general population North Carolina sample and the top 11% of the fisheater sample in Michigan.
7494667	Immunologic effects of pre- and postnatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)/dioxin exposure in Dutch infants from birth to 18 mo of age are explored. The total study group consisted of 207 healthy mother-infant pairs, of which 105 infants were breast-fed and 102 children were bottle-fed. Prenatal PCB exposure was estimated by the PCB sum (PCB congeners 118, 138, 153, and 180) in maternal blood and the total toxic equivalent (TEQ) level in human milk (17 dioxin and 8 dioxin-like PCB congeners). Postnatal PCB/dioxin exposure was calculated as a product of the total TEQ level in human milk multiplied by the weeks of breast-feeding. The number of periods with rhinitis, bronchitis, tonsillitis, and otitis during the first 18 mo of life was used as an estimate of the health status of the infants. Humoral immunity was measured at 18 mo of age by detecting antibody levels to mumps, measles, and rubella. White blood cell counts (monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes) and immunologic marker analyses CD4+ T-lymphocytes, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, activated T-lymphocytes (HLA-DR+CD3+), as well as T cell receptor (TcR) alpha beta+, TcR gamma delta+, CD4+CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RO+ T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes (CD19+ and/or CD20+) and NK cells (CD16+ and/or CD56+/CD3-) in cord blood and venous blood at 3 and 18 mo of age were assessed in a subgroup of 55 infants. There was no relationship between pre- and postnatal PCB/dioxin exposure and upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms or humoral antibody production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
20384380	Experimental evidence from animals indicates that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes deterioration of the outer hair cells (OHCs) of the cochlea. To test this hypothesis in humans, we measured serum PCB concentrations in 574 12-year-old children residing in three districts in the Slovak Republic using high-resolution gas chromatography with microelectron capture detection. As a marker of cochlear status, we measured transient evoked (TE) and distortion product (DP) otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and assessed the cross-sectional association between serum PCBs and OAEs. Median total PCB concentrations were 352.8, 150.5, and 134.9 ng/g lipid in Michalovce, Svidnik, and Bratislava, respectively. In multivariate regression models where otoacoustic measures were modeled as a function of log (base 10) PCB concentrations with adjustment for gender, age, and site of examination, dioxin-like PCBs, nondioxin-like PCBs and a PCB grouping targeting upregulation of hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase were significantly associated with lower TEOAE powers at 1000 and 1500 Hz. At 1500 Hz, we observed a strong association with sum of PCBs and DL-PCBs, in the left ear only. The DPOAEs at 1000 Hz were associated with all four PCB groupings. The results of this study show that PCBs may affect the OHCs of the cochlea, a result consistent with findings from animal studies published to date.
12117636	We examined predictors of organochlorine concentrations in serum specimens from women who were pregnant in the 1960s and participated in the Child Health and Development Study in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. That study enrolled pregnant women at the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Facilities, conducted interviews, and drew blood specimens; these specimens were centrifuged and the resulting serum specimens were frozen and placed in long-term storage. For the current investigation, organochlorines were measured by dual-column GC-electron capture detection in specimens collected in 1963-1967 from 399 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters. Using multiple linear regression models adjusted for serum lipids, we evaluated factors predicting concentrations of 11 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, their sum, and several pesticides and metabolites. Variables evaluated were age, race, place of birth, date of blood draw, body mass index, occupation, past residence on a farm, parity, and duration of pregnancy at blood draw. Concentrations of highly chlorinated PCBs and the sum of the PCBs increased with age. Concentrations of certain PCB congeners, as well as the sum, were significantly higher among nonwhites and increased with calendar date of blood draw. (italic)p,p(/italic) -DDT and (italic)p,p(/italic) -DDE concentrations were about 50% higher for nonwhites compared with whites and for those born in California or the southeastern United States versus elsewhere in the United States. Higher body mass index was associated with lower concentrations of several PCBs and (italic)p,p(/italic) -DDE but with higher heptachlor epoxide and DDT levels. The increase in use of PCBs during the 1960s is apparently detectable as increasing concentrations in maternal sera between 1963 and 1967. Marked racial and regional differences in serum pesticide levels were likely caused by geographic variation in previous agricultural and vector-control uses. The relationship to body mass index appears to be complex.
20698547	Despite the continued presence of PCBs in indoor and ambient air, few studies have investigated the inhalation route of exposure. While dietary exposure has declined, inhalation of the semivolatile, lower-chlorinated PCBs has risen in importance. We measured the uptake, distribution, and time course of elimination of inhaled PCB congeners to characterize the pulmonary route after short-term exposure. Vapor-phase PCBs were generated from Aroclor 1242 to a nose-only exposure system and characterized for congener levels and profiles. Rats were exposed via inhalation acutely (2.4 mg/m3 for 2 h) or subacutely (8.2 mg/m3, 2 hx10 days), after which pulmonary immune responses and PCB tissue levels were measured. Animals acutely exposed were euthanized at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h post exposure to assess the time course of PCB uptake and elimination. Following rapid absorption and distribution, PCBs accumulated in adipose tissue but decayed in other tissues with half-lives increasing in liver (5.6 h)<lung (8.2 h)<brain (8.5 h)<blood (9.7 h). PCB levels were similar in lung, liver, and adipose tissue, lower in brain, and lowest in blood. Inhalation of the airborne PCB mixture contributed significantly to the body burden of lower-chlorinated congeners. Congeners detected in tissue were mostly ortho-substituted ranging from mono- to pentachlorobiphenyls. Selective uptake and elimination led to accumulation of a distinct congener spectrum in tissue. Minimal evidence of toxicity was observed.
14559265	From 1998 to 2000, the dioxin levels were measured in the milk of 299 mothers who lived in Saitama prefecture, Japan. Factors that influenced the dioxin levels were investigated based on a questionnaire given to the milk donors at that time. It was found that the dioxin levels in the milk of the mothers who smoked were lower than those of non-smokers, and the dioxin levels were generally low in the mothers who were heavy smokers. The average dioxin levels in the milk of mothers who had been breast-fed were higher than those given formula, and there was a significant difference in the dioxin congeners. It was also found that the dioxin levels in milk of the women who regularly consumed fish and shellfish were generally higher. There was a strong correlation between summation operator TEQ and PCB126. The data suggested that PCB126 could be a useful indicator for the simplified analysis of dioxin in human milk.
8209226	We measured the residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the serum of 23 residents of the New Bedford, Massachusetts, area and from two homogenates each of bluefish and lobsters from the same area. We used congener-specific and total Aroclor quantitative approaches, both of which involved gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (electron ionization mode), we confirmed the presence of PCBs in the combined serum samples and in the aliquots of bluefish and lobsters. In measuring the PCB levels in serum, we found good agreement between the two electron capture detector approaches (r > or = 0.97) when the serum of specific congeners was compared to total Aroclor. We used univariate and multivariate quality control approaches to monitor these analyses. Analytical results for bluefish showed a better agreement between the two techniques than did those for lobsters; however, the small number of samples precluded any statistical comparison. We also measured levels of chlorinated pesticides in the serum samples of two groups of New Bedford residents, those with low PCB levels (< 15 ng/ml) and those with high PCB levels (> or = 15 ng/ml). We found that residents with high PCB levels also tended to have higher levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE). The higher concentration of all three analytes appears to be influenced by employment in the capacitor industry, by seafood consumption, or both. Using Jaccard measures of similarity and principal component analysis we compared the gas chromatographic patterns of PCBs found in the serum of New Bedford area residents with high serum PCBs with the patterns found in homogenates of lobsters (inclusive of all edible portions except the roe), in homogenates of bluefish fillets taken from local waters, and in serum from goats fed selected technical Aroclors (e.g. Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, or 1260). The patterns found in human serum samples were similar to the patterns found in lobster homogenates. Both of these patterns closely resembled patterns found in the serum samples of the goat fed aroclor 1254, as demonstrated by both pattern recognition techniques. In addition, the chromatographic patterns of human serum and of lobsters and bluefish homogenates all indicated the presence of PCBs more characteristic of Aroclors 1016 or 1242.
12515680	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants that are ubiquitous in the food chain, and detectable amounts are in the blood of almost every person in most populations that have been examined. Extensive evidence from animal studies shows that PCBs are neurotoxins, even at low doses. Interpretation of human data regarding low-level, early-life PCB exposure and subsequent neurodevelopment is problematic because levels of exposure were not similarly quantified across studies. We expressed the exposure levels from 10 studies of PCB and neurodevelopment in a uniform manner using a combination of data from original investigators, laboratory reanalyses, calculations based on published data, and expert opinion. The mainstay of our comparison was the median level of PCB 153 in maternal pregnancy serum. The median concentration of PCB 153 in the 10 studies ranged from 30 to 450 ng/g serum lipid, and the median of the 10 medians was 110 ng/g. We found that (a)) the distribution of PCB 153 exposure in most studies overlapped substantially, (b)) exposure levels in the Faroe Islands study were about 3-4-fold higher than in most other studies, and (c)) the exposure levels in the two recent U.S. studies were about one-third of those in the four earlier U.S. studies or recent Dutch, German, and northern Québec studies. Our results will facilitate a direct comparison of the findings on PCBs and neurodevelopment when they are published for all 10 studies.
20040582	Effects of Kanechlor-500 (KC500), a commercial polychlorinated biphenyl mixture, on the levels of serum thyroid hormones such as total thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine were examined in male mice, hamsters, rats, and guinea pigs. Four days after a single intraperitoneal injection of KC500, significant decreases in the levels of the serum total T(4) and free T(4) occurred in all the animals examined, whereas a significant decrease in the level of serum triiodothyronine was observed only in guinea pigs among the animals examined. In addition, no significant change in the level of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was observed in any of the rodents examined. A significant increase in the activity of hepatic T(4)-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase after the KC500 administration occurred only in guinea pigs, whereas the increase in the amount of biliary [(125)I]T(4) glucuronide after an intravenous injection of [(125)I]T(4) to the KC500-pretreated animals occurred only in rats. On the other hand, in all the rodents examined, KC500-pretreatment promoted the clearance of [(125)I]T(4) from the serum and led to a significant increase in the steady-state distribution volumes of [(125)I]T(4). Likewise, its pretreatment raised the concentration ratio (K(p) value) of the liver to serum and the liver distribution of [(125)I]T(4) in all the rodents tested. The present findings indicate that for the first time the KC500-mediated decrease in the serum T(4) level in mice, hamsters, rats and guinea pigs occurs mainly through an increase in the accumulation level of T(4) in the liver.
17366814	OBJECTIVE: Our aim in the present study was to characterize and quantify the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and specific polychlorobiphenylol (OH-PCB) metabolites in maternal sera from women delivering in eastern Slovakia. DESIGN: During 2002-2004, blood samples were collected from women delivering in two Slovak locations: Michalovce district, where PCBs were formerly manufactured, and Svidnik and Stropkov districts, about 70 km north. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 762 and 341 pregnant women were sampled from Michalovce and Svidnik/Stropkov, respectively, and OH-PCBs were measured in 131 and 31. EVALUATION/MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed PCBs using gas chromatography (GC)/electron capture detection. OH-PCBs and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were determined as methyl derivatives using GC-electron capture negative ionization/mass spectrometry. We characterized distributions in the full cohort using inverse sampling weights. RESULTS: The concentrations of both PCBs and OH-PCB metabolites of Michalovce mothers were about two times higher than those of the Svidnik/Stropkov mothers (p < 0.001). The median weighted maternal serum levels of the sum of PCBs (sigmaPCBs) were 5.73 ng/g wet weight (Michalovce) and 2.82 ng/g wet weight (Svidnik/Stropkov). The median sum of OH-PCBs (ZOH-PCBs) was 0.55 ng/g wet weight in Michalovce mothers and 0.32 ng/g wet weight in Svidnik/Stropkov mothers. 4-OH-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-Heptachlorobiphenyl (4-OH-CB187) was a primary metabolite, followed by 4-OH-2,2',3,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (4-OH-CB146). Only four PCB congeners-CBs 153, 138, 180, and 170--had higher concentrations than 4-OH-CB187 and 4-OH-CB146 (p < 0.001). The median ratio of the sigmaOH-PCBs to the sigmaPCBs was 0.10. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers residing in eastern Slovakia are still highly exposed to PCBs, and their body burdens of these pollutants and OH-PCB metabolites may pose a risk for adverse effects on health for themselves and their children. 
18313660	The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposure in non-diabetic pregnant women. Forty gravidas, 21-39 years of age and residing within the study area, were recruited. Seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted dichloro-p-dioxin, dibenzofurans and 12 PCBs were measured using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Serum insulin and glucose were also measured. Insulin sensitivity and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated based on fasting glucose and insulin levels. Three specific congeners of PCBs (123, 126, and 169) were significantly associated with insulin activity (r=-0.34 approximately -0.36, p<0.05). Statistical analyses revealed that insulin sensitivity was significantly associated with age- and pre-pregnancy body mass indices (BMI)-adjusted for decreasing toxic equivalents (TEQ) of PCBs (p=0.02 for age- and BMI-adjusted). We also performed an insulin correlation for total TEQ and the TEQ of PCBs, and determined that insulin sensitivity was predicted by the TEQ of PCBs by a regression coefficient of -0.189 after adjustment for age and pre-pregnancy BMI. These findings suggest that PCBs may be associated with decreasing insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic pregnant women; however, the mechanism remains to be ascertained.
11381748	PCB levels in blood of common terns (Sterna hirundo) from Terneuzen, a breeding colony in The Netherlands with relatively low breeding success, were significantly higher than in birds from two Dutch reference colonies, one nearby (Oesterdam) and one further away (the Isle of Griend). However, a detailed analysis of the patterns of PCB congeners in birds from the different colonies indicated that birds from Terneuzen and to a lesser extent birds from the Oesterdam showed Ah-receptor mediated activity of P450 iso-enzymes. It is concluded that the induction of this enzyme activity in Terneuzen may be related to PCBs as well as other non-identified compounds. In contrast to this, it is likely that at the Oesterdam non-identified compounds are mainly responsible for the enzyme activity, resulting in a shift of PCB congener patterns.
17185286	BACKGROUND: Animal studies have shown that exposure to common, low-level environmental contaminants [e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), lead] causes excessive and inappropriate responding on intermittent reinforcement schedules. The Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates task (DRL) has been shown to be especially sensitive to low-level PCB exposure in monkeys. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationships between prenatal PCB and postnatal Pb exposure performance on a DRL schedule in children. We predicted that a) prenatal PCB exposure would reduce interresponse times (IRTs) and reinforcements earned, and b) postnatal Pb exposure would reduce IRTs and reinforcements earned. METHODS: We tested 167 children on a DRL20 (20 sec) reinforcement schedule, and recorded IRTs and the number of reinforced responses across the session. We measured prenatal PCB exposure (cord blood), methylmercury (MeHg) (maternal hair), and postnatal Pb exposure (venous blood), and > 50 potentially confounding variables. RESULTS: Results indicated impaired performance in children exposed to PCBs, MeHg, and Pb. Children prenatally exposed to PCBs responded excessively, with significantly lower IRTs and fewer reinforcers earned across the session. In addition, exposure to either MeHg or Pb predicted statistically significant impairments of a similar magnitude to those for PCBs, and the associated impairments of all three contaminants (PCB, MeHg, and Pb) were statistically independent of one another. CONCLUSIONS: These results, taken with animal literature, argue the high sensitivity of DRL performance to low-level PCB, MeHg, and Pb exposure. Future research should employ behavioral tasks in children, such as DRL, that have been demonstrably sensitive to low-level PCB, MeHg, and Pb exposure in animals. 
11351711	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain public health concerns because of their persistence in the environment and their potential health impact. We linked data from three mixed cross-sectional/longitudinal surveys of Michigan anglers conducted by the Michigan Department of Public Health in 1973-1974, 1979-1982, and 1989-1993 to examine the association between sport-caught fish consumption and serum PCBs. The reported weight of fish consumed declined over the three surveys (median 40, 38, and 31 lb/yr). Serum Aroclor 1260 levels were 2-3 times higher in fish-eaters than in nonfish-eaters in all three surveys in both men and women. In nonfish-eaters, serum PCB levels rose between 1973-1974 and 1979-1982 [adjusted change = 0.30 log(ppb), p = 0.01] and then declined between 1979-1982 and 1989-1993 [adjusted change = -0.16 log(ppb), p = 0.002]. Among fish-eaters, serum PCB levels also rose between 1973-1974 and 1979-1982 [adjusted change = 0.45 log(ppb), p < 0.001] but were unchanged between 1979-1982 and 1989-1993 [adjusted change = -0.09 log(ppb), p = 0.14]. Predictors of serum PCB levels included annual fish consumption, gender, and age. We conclude that background human serum levels of Aroclor 1260 had declined by 1989-1993 from earlier peak levels. Among consumers of sport-caught Great Lake fish, serum PCB levels did not significantly decrease, probably due to continued exposure and the long half-life of PCB.
18718631	We conducted a congener-specific analysis of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (non-dioxin-like PCBs) in blood collected between July 2002 and July 2004 from 195 pregnant women living in Sapporo City of Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The present study is one of the few studies in which full congener concentrations of non-dioxin-like PCBs have been measured in the blood of pregnant women. Of the 195 pregnant women, 101 were primipara (mean: 28.8 years, median: 28.0 years) and 94 were multipara (mean: 32.3 years, median: 33.0 years). Among the 197 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners, 58 congeners were identified in the blood of pregnant women. The arithmetic mean total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers in Sapporo City were 42.2-329.3 (mean: 114.5, median: 98.6) and 31.5-258.0 (mean: 100.3, median: 91.4)ngg(-1)lipid, respectively. The results show that the contamination of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of women has decreased compared to past levels in other domestic areas, in which the subject age was similar to that in this study. The results of the present study indicate that current levels of non-dioxin-like PCBs in the blood of Japanese women and can be used as baseline data for future temporal trends. The sums of the ratios of the concentrations of hexaCBs and heptaCBs to the total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers were 78.5% and 77.7%, respectively. The hexaCBs ratios in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers were 45.4% and 44.7%, respectively. HexaCB-153 among hexaCBs congeners, the most abundant congener in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers, contributed approximately 22.0% and 21.8% to the total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCBs congeners that were measured in the blood, respectively. Among the non-dioxin-like PCB congeners measured in the present study, hexaCB-138, heptaCB-170, heptaCB-180, and heptaCB-182/heptaCB-187 also showed high ratios to total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners detected in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers. With regard to the relationship between the total concentrations of 58 non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in maternal blood and the number of deliveries or the age of primiparous and multifarious mothers, the total levels of these PCB congeners tended to decreases with increases in the number of deliveries and significantly increased with increasing maternal age in both groups. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between the total concentrations of these PCB congeners in blood and the age of primiparae and multiparae. The concentrations of hexaCB-153 in the blood of primiparous and multiparous mothers showed a close correlation to the total concentrations of these PCBs, suggesting that hexaCB-153 could be an indicator of total concentrations of non-dioxin-like PCB congeners in the blood of pregnant women.
17120554	Lack of human exposure data is frequently reported as a critical gap in risk assessments of environmental pollutants, especially regarding "new" pollutants. The objectives of this study were to assess serum levels of the persistent 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites (OH-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and hexabromocyclodode-canes (HBCDDs) in a group of Swedish middle-aged and elderly women expected to be relatively highly exposed, and to evaluate the impact of potential determinants (e.g., fish intake, age) for the inter-individual variation, as well as to investigate the association between these pollutants and bone density. No associations were found between bone mineral density or biochemical markers of bone metabolism and the analyzed environmental pollutants. Relatively high levels of CB-153 (median 260 ng/g fat) and sigma 3-OH-PCBs (median 1.7 ng/mL serum), and low concentrations of sigma6PBDEs (median 3.6 ng/g fat) were determined. Total level of HBCDDs in serum was quantified by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (median 0.5 ng/g fat). HBCDD diastereomeric and enantiomeric patterns were determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The dominating stereoisomer was (-)alpha-HBCDD, but 1-3% of gamma-HBCDD was also detected in the serum samples.
20605211	The use of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been severely restricted due to their high toxicity and persistency in the environment. However, the presence of PCBs in human tissues nowadays is still been reported worldwide. Background exposure predictors of the human PCB body burden require more precise understanding. In the present study, PCB congeners 138, 153, and 180 were quantified in adult adipose tissue samples (n=387) from Granada Province (Southern Spain) and data on potential predictors of PCB concentrations were gathered by questionnaire. Chemical analysis of the selected congeners was done by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and multivariate analyses were performed stratifying by gender. PCB residues were quantified in 92% (PCB 153), 90% (PCB 180), and 86% (PCB 138) of the population. Geometric mean concentrations were 161.65+/-4.41 ng/g lipid for PCB 153, 111.62+/-6.27 ng/g lipid for PCB 180, and 38.41+/-8.61 ng/g lipid for PCB 138. Multivariate models explained 30-36% of the variability in PCB concentrations. Age and body mass index (BMI) predicted exposure in both males and females and were positively correlated with the concentration of the three PCB congeners. Occupation and diet predicted exposure in the males, whereas only dietary predictors were observed in the females. Further in-depth studies are required to investigate the influence of dietary habits on the bioaccumulation of PCBs and to evaluate the impact of policies aimed at reducing human exposure.
11823002	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and complete carcinogens in rodents. Metabolism of lower chlorinated congeners with rat liver microsomes was investigated in earlier studies and DNA adduction was also reported. The current study was designed to compare DNA adducts formed after bioactivation of PCBs with rat, mouse and human hepatic microsomes, and to investigate the role of quinoid PCB metabolites in DNA adduct formation. Eight congeners ranging from mono- to hexachlorinated biphenyls were tested. Metabolites obtained through microsomal bioactivation as well as synthetic quinoid metabolites of 4-monochlorobiphenyl (4-CB) were incubated with calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA), and the resulting adducts were analyzed by the 32P-post-labelling method. DNA adducts were formed with mono- di- and tri-chlorinated congeners, but not with higher chlorinated congeners. Similar adduct patterns were observed for 2-monochlorobiphenyl (2-CB) activated with hepatic microsomes from rat, mouse and human, while 4-CB, 3,4-dichlorobiphenyl (3,4-CB) and 3,4,5-trichlorobiphenyl (3,4,5-CB) showed similar patterns for two out of the three microsomal systems tested. 4,4' -trichlorobiphenyl (4,4' -CB) showed different adduct patterns in all microsomal systems. Higher adduct levels were obtained with the rodent microsomes compared with human microsomes and were related to higher cytochrome P450 activity. When adducts derived from microsomal activation of 4-CB were compared by co-chromatography with those derived from the incubation of DNA with synthetic 2-(4' -chlorophenyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (4-BQ), one adduct co-migrated in three different chromatography systems. This study demonstrates that rodents as well as human hepatic enzymes metabolize lower chlorinated biphenyl congeners to reactive intermediates that form DNA adducts in vitro and shows that the para-quinone metabolites of PCBs are, in part, involved in direct DNA adduction.
16882522	Blood and/or breast milk have been used to assess human exposure to various environmental contaminants. Few studies have been available to compare the concentrations in one matrix with those in another. The goals of this study were to determine the current levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Japanese women, with analysis of the effects of lifestyle and dietary habits on these levels, and to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) with which to predict the ratio of serum concentration to breast milk concentration. We measured PBDEs and PCBs in 89 paired samples of serum and breast milk collected in four regions of Japan in 2005. The geometric means of the total concentrations of PBDE (13 congeners) in milk and serum were 1.56 and 2.89 ng/g lipid, respectively, whereas those of total PCBs (15 congeners) were 63.9 and 37.5 ng/g lipid, respectively. The major determinant of total PBDE concentration in serum and milk was the geographic area within Japan, whereas nursing duration was the major determinant of PCB concentration. BDE-209 was the most predominant PBDE congener in serum but not in milk. The excretion of BDE 209 in milk was lower than that of BDE 47 and BDE 153. QSAR analysis revealed that two parameters, calculated octanol/water partition and number of hydrogen-bond acceptors, were significant descriptors. During the first weeks of lactation, the predicted partitioning of PBDE and PCB congeners from serum to milk agreed with the observed values. However, the prediction became weaker after 10 weeks of nursing.
15178094	In an attempt to learn more about the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system of mussels, we used protein databases and alignment software to extract highly conserved CYP sequences. From these alignments synthetic peptides were produced and used for rabbit immunisation, which yielded polyclonal antibodies against the CYP families 2 and 4. The antibodies were evaluated with Western Blot and ELISA assays, using digestive gland microsomal samples from the mussel Mytilus edulis. Western Blots revealed immunoreactions for both antibodies. The anti-CYP2 sequence rendered one major immunopositive protein of approximately 49 kDa size, and weak signals for proteins of approximately 41 and 56 kDa size. The anti-CYP4 sequence rendered two major bands of approximately 56 and 59 kDa size, and also a weak immunoreaction with a protein of approximately 43 kDa size. ELISA rendered only weak signals even with a 1:50 dilution of IgG-purified serum. A 10-day exposure to Aroclor 1254 did not appear to affect any of the immunopositive proteins, while total PCBs in soft bodies increased from 14-40 ng/g DW in controls to 373-638 ng/g DW in exposed mussels.
12191885	This paper describes a simple procedure for the quantitative analysis of 25 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB) in serum. They are PCB 70, 74, 77, 87, 99, 101, 118, 126, 128, 138, 151, 153, 156, 169, 170, 180, 183, 187, 191, 194, 205, 206, 208 and 209. In addition, 15 pesticides are analyzed in the same extract: aldrin, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan I, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, lindane, methoxychlor, mirex, pentachlorobenzene, and 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene. The procedure involved sample cleanup using a combination of C18 and NH(2) solid phase extraction cartridges. The instrumental technique was gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with both electron ionization and negative chemical ionization in the selected ion monitoring mode. Concentration of sub-ng/ml level was attainable with 2 ml of serum sample.
22846166	Although inhalation of atmospheric polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is the most universal exposure route and has become a substantial concern in urban areas, research is lacking to determine the body burden of inhaled PCBs and consequent health effects. To reflect the Chicago airshed environment and mimic the PCB profile in Chicago air, we generated vapors from a Chicago air mixture (CAM). Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the CAM vapor for 1.6 h/day via nose-only inhalation for 4 weeks, 520 ± 10 μg/m(3). Congener-specific quantification in tissue and air samples was performed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). In contrast to the lower-chlorinated congener-enriched vapor, body tissues mainly contained tri- to hexachlorobiphenyls. Congener profiles varied between vapor and tissues and among different organs. The toxic equivalence (TEQ) and neurotoxic equivalence (NEQ) were also investigated for tissue distribution. We evaluated a variety of end points to catalogue the effects of long-term inhalation exposure, including immune responses, enzyme induction, cellular toxicity, and histopathologic abnormalities. Glutathione oxidized/reduced ratio (GSSG/GSH) was increased in the blood of exposed animals, accompanied by elevation of hematocrit. This study demonstrated that inhalation contributed to the body burden of mostly tri- to hexachlorobiphenyls and produced a distinct profile of congeners in tissue, yet minimal toxicity was found at this exposure dose, estimated at 134 μg/rat.
21340456	In this study, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) levels were determined in 100 human milk samples from the city of Antalya. The levels of seven major PCB congeners; 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180 and nine OCPs, α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH, HCB, heptachlor epoxide, p.p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, endosulfan-α and endosulfan-β were determined by gas chromatography with ECD detection. The levels of analyzed compounds were as follows: ΣPCBs 27.46 ± 11.58, ΣDDT 1,407 ± 123, and ΣBHC 160 ± 490 ng/g lipid wt.basis. PCB 153 and p,p'-DDE were the dominant contaminants. The results have been discussed and compared with similar studies from other regions of Turkey.
17938733	BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that diabetes, a condition whose incidence is increasing, is associated with exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential association between diabetes and serum levels of PCBs, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and mirex in a cross-sectional study of an adult Native-American (Mohawk) population. METHODS: Through a standardized questionnaire we collected demographic, medical, and lifestyle information from 352 adults, > or =30 years of age. We collected fasting serum samples that were analyzed for 101 PCB congeners, DDE, HCB, and mirex along with fasting glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Participants who had fasting-glucose values > 125 mg/dL and/or who were taking antidiabetic medication were defined as persons with diabetes. We conducted logistic regression to assess the potential association between organochlorine serum levels and diabetes, while controlling for the potential confounding variables of age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, sex, and serum lipid levels. Organochlorine serum levels were categorized in tertiles, and the lowest tertile was used as the reference category. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 20.2%. The odds ratio (OR) of having diabetes for participants in the highest tertile of total PCB concentration compared with the lowest tertile was 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-10.6). The corresponding ORs for DDE and HCB were even higher. Elevated serum mirex was not associated with diabetes. After adjustment for other analytes, the OR for HCB remained significant, whereas ORs for PCBs and DDE remained elevated but not statistically significant. In contrast, after adjustment for other analytes, the OR for mirex became statistically significant and indicated an inverse association. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of adult Native Americans, elevated serum PCBs, DDE, and HCB were positively associated with diabetes after controlling for potential confounders, whereas a negative association was observed for mirex. 
15581934	This work compares two lipid extraction methods for determining 24 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), seven dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and ten dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in human blood plasma. The first method was based on conventional liquid-liquid partitioning with chloroform-methanol and the other made use of a sorbent (Chem-Elut) to facilitate the partitioning of lipids into a mixture of hexane and 2-propanol. A multi-layer-silica column including acid- and base-impregnated silica gel was used to reduce the amounts of lipid present in the samples before a basic alumina clean-up step and activated carbon fractionation of planar analytes (PCDD/Fs and non-ortho-PCBs) and non-planar analytes (including ortho-chlorinated PCBs). Gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify the analytes in the two fractions. The wet weight based concentrations obtained by the two methods were in agreement but both methods suffer from large organic solvent consumption. The toxic equivalencies derived for PCBs and PCDD/Fs using the two methods were also in agreement. However, the chloroform-methanol method gave slightly higher lipid recoveries, although with greater variation, than the sorbent-assisted method. Nevertheless, despite giving lower lipid recoveries, the sorbent-assisted method has advantages in ease of use and applicability to whole blood samples. The formation of emulsions was avoided with the Chem-Elut method, which probably explains the lower variability in the lipid determinations.
7589917	The toxicity of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) and 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 118) was investigated in rats following subchronic dietary exposure. Groups of 10 male and 10 female weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PCB 77 in the diet at 0, 10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 ppb for 13 weeks. PCB 118 was administered to males in the diet at 0, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 ppb, while the female groups received 0, 2, 20, 200, or 2000 ppb of the congener for 13 weeks. Growth rate and food consumption were not affected by treatment. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed. Increased spleen weight occurred in male rats fed 1000 or 10,000 ppb PCB 77. Male rats receiving 10,000 ppb PCB 118 had increased liver weight and hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Increased hepatic EROD activity but not liver weight was observed in female rats given the 2000-ppb PCB 118 diet. Increased EROD activity was also noted in male rats given 10,000 ppb and in female groups receiving 1000 or 10,000 ppb PCB 77. Male rats exposed to 10,000 ppb PCB 77 had decreased vitamin A in the liver and lung and elevated levels in the kidney. Liver vitamin A of both 1000- and 10,000-ppb PCB 77 female groups was decreased. PCB 118 had no effects on tissue vitamin A at the levels studied. No hematological changes or serum biochemical changes were seen in any of PCB 118- and PCB 77-treated groups, nor were liver uroporphyrin levels altered. A reduction in dopamine and homovanillinic acid in substantia nigra region of the brain was observed in female rats fed 2000 ppb PCB 118, while 10,000 ppb PCB 77 was associated with an elevation in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the nucleus accumbens region of male rat brains. Mild to moderate changes were observed in the liver and thyroid of rats given PCB 77 or PCB 118. PCB 118 accumulated in a dose-dependent manner in fat and to a much lesser extent in liver. In contrast, very low levels of PCB 77 residue were found in the tissues examined. Based on the above data it was concluded that NOAEL of PCB 77 is 100 ppb in diet or 8.7 micrograms/kg and that of PCB 118 is 200 ppb in diet or 17 micrograms/kg body wt/day.
16093292	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), once used widely in transformers and other applications, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), the main metabolite of the pesticide 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), are hormonally active agents. Changes in menstrual cycle functioning associated with PCBs and DDE, and increased odds of spontaneous abortion associated with DDE, suggest that these compounds could affect fertility. The authors investigated the association between PCB and DDE exposure and time to pregnancy by using serum levels measured in 390 pregnant women in the Collaborative Perinatal Project enrolled at 12 study centers in the United States from 1959 to 1965. They estimated adjusted fecundability odds ratios by using Cox proportional hazards modeling for discrete time data. Compared with time to pregnancy for women in the lowest exposure category (PCBs < 1.24 microg/liter, DDE < 14 microg/liter), time to pregnancy increased for women in the highest exposure category in terms of both PCBs (fecundability odds ratio for PCBs > or = 5.00 microg/liter = 0.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.36, 1.18) and DDE (fecundability odds ratio for DDE > or = 60 microg/liter = 0.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.32, 1.31). Overall, time to pregnancy increased with increasing serum PCB levels but was less suggestive of an association with DDE. Both trends were imprecise and attenuated when expressed on a lipid basis. Overall, evidence of an association between PCB or DDE exposure and time to pregnancy was weak and inconclusive.
21544918	This study investigated the effects of exposure to the ubiquitous contaminants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the fetal adrenal cortex and on plasma cortisol using the domestic sheep (Ovis aries) as a model. Pregnant ewes were intendedly subjected to oral treatment with PCB 153 (98 μg/kg bw/day), PCB 118 (49 μg/kg bw/day) or the vehicle corn oil from mating until euthanasia on gestation day 134 (±0.25 SE). However, because of accidental cross-contamination occurring twice causing a mixed exposure scenario in all three groups, the focus of this paper is to compare three distinct groups of fetuses with different adipose tissue PCB levels (PCB 153high, PCB 118high and low, combined groups) rather than comparing animals exposed to single PCB congeners to those of a control group. When comparing endocrine and anatomical parameters from fetuses in the PCB 153high (n = 13) or PCB 118high (n = 14) groups with the low, combined group (n = 14), there was a significant decrease in fetal body weight (P < 0.05), plasma cortisol concentration (P < 0.001) and adrenal cortex thickness (P < 0.001). Furthermore, adrenal weight was decreased and plasma ACTH was increased only in the PCB 118high group. Expression of several genes encoding enzymes and receptors related to steroid hormone synthesis was also affected and mostly down-regulated in fetuses with high PCB tissue levels. In conclusion, we suggest that mono-and di-ortho PCBs were able to interfere with growth, adrenal development and cortisol production in the fetal sheep model. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

818399	This study was undertaken to determine the residual effects of a polychlorinated biphenyl (Aroclor 1254) fed to male rats at dietary concentrations of 0, 5, 50, and 500 ppm in diet. The animals were treated for 4 wk (acute and subacute phase), then observed for periods of up to 50 wk following termination of exposure (residual phase). The most significant histopathologic alteration was fatty degenerative change in the liver, which was most marked at 9 wk. Forty-six weeks postexposure, more than 50% of the rats fed 500 ppm still demonstrated fatty degenerative changes. On electron microscopic examination, marked increases in lipid vacuoles and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) occurred with a concomitant decrease in rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) profiles in the animals receiving 50-500ppm for 4 wk. Thirty-seven weeks following the exposure period, rats dosed with 50 ppm showed partial recovery toward control morphology (less lipid, less SER, more RER), while those receiving 500 ppm did not. Persistent morphologic alterations included an increase in SER and medium-density lipid material within cisternae of Ser, Golgi and Golgi-condensing vesicles, as well as a decrease in parallel arrays of RER. The persistence of ultrastructural alteration throughout the 46-wk residual phase emphasizes the long-lasting effects of 4-wk exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl.
20723988	An understanding of congener specific cellular absorption of PCBs is important to the study of the organ specific body burden of an individual and to their toxic effects. We have previously demonstrated that single PCB congeners induce cytotoxicity, as evidenced by decreased cellular viability and accelerated apoptotic death. There is very little, if any, information available on the differences in toxicity due to the nature of absorption of PCBs in different cells. To obtain such information human liver (HepG2) cells (in medium with 10% FBS) were exposed to 70 μM of both PCB-153 (non-coplanar hexachlorobiphenyl) and PCB-77 (coplanar tetrachlorobiphenyl), and human kidney (HK2) cells in serum free medium were exposed to 80 and 40 μM of PCB-153 and PCB-77 respectively, according to their LC(50) values in these cells. Medium and cells were collected separately at each time interval from 30 min to 48 h, and PCB concentrations were analyzed in both by GC-MS using biphenyl as an internal standard following hexane:acetone (50:50) extraction. We also performed trypan blue exclusion, DNA fragmentation and fluorescence microscopic studies in assessing cell viability and apoptotic cell death. About 40% of PCB-153 (35 μM, 50% of the maximum value) was detected in HepG2 cells within 30 min, and it reached its highest concentration at 6h (60 μM), concomitant with the PCB depletion in the medium (5 μM). For PCB-77, the highest concentrations within the cells were reached at 3h. However, the absorption levels of PCB-153 and PCB-77 in HK2 cells reached their peaks at 3 and 6h respectively. Exposure of human liver and kidney cells to PCB-153 and PCB-77 caused accelerated apoptotic cell death in a time-dependent manner. The studies demonstrated that (1) liver cells initiate the absorption of PCBs much faster than kidney cells; however, the concentration reaches its maximum level much earlier in kidney cells; (2) both PCB-153 and PCB-77 induced enhanced apoptotic death in liver and kidney cells; and (3) kidney cells are more vulnerable to PCBs based on the results of apoptosis and cellular viability, even with almost similar absorption or tissue burden of PCBs.
21737118	Thyroid hormones, which influence body metabolism and development, could be affected by persistent organic pollutants. We sought to examine the relationship between polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and thyroid disease. We employed incidence density sampling to perform a nested case control analysis of the Michigan Long-Term PBB Cohort. Cohort members (n=3333) were exposed to PBBs through contaminated cattle feed in 1973-1974 and to PCBs through daily life. Those with detectable serum PBB and PCB concentrations at enrollment were categorized into tertiles of PBB and PCB exposure. Case-patients were cohort members answering "Yes" to "Has a healthcare provider ever told you that you had a thyroid problem?" during follow-up interviews; control-patients were cohort members answering "No". We used odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare odds of thyroid disease by PBB and PCB exposure and by various risk factors. Total cumulative thyroid disease incidence after 33 years was 13.9% among women and 2.6% among men. After adjusting for body mass index, we found no statistically significant differences in odds of any type of thyroid disease among women or men with elevated PBB or PCB exposure. Compared to control-patients, women with thyroid disease had increased odds of being overweight/obese (OR=2.82, 95% CI: 1.94-4.11) and developing infertility (OR=1.71, 95% CI: 1.08-2.69), diabetes (OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.04-2.51), or arthritis (OR=1.71, 95% CI: 1.18-2.50) during follow-up. Additional research should explore potential associations between PBBs/PCBs and thyroid disease among children exposed in utero.
15788176	From the late 1950s to the early 1970s elastic polysulphide sealants were used in outdoor seams between concrete blocks in prefabricated buildings. The sealants contained 5-30% polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Due to the weathering of sealants in general and the replacement of seams with new PCB-free materials in the 1990s, PCBs have drifted to the soil adjacent to buildings. The objectives of this study were to survey PCB contamination in the surroundings of former PCB-containing buildings and to evaluate the risks to human health. Samples from soil, and also from blood serum of residents, were collected to obtain data for exposure assessment. The health risk assessment was based on deterministic and probabilistic calculations for cancer and non-cancer risks. Soil ingestion and dermal contact were considered the main routes of exposure and children the most important exposed group. The mean total PCB concentration was 6.83 mg/kg within 2m of the buildings and 0.52 mg/kg within 3-10 m from of the buildings. The deterministic risk assessment with conservative parameters resulted in lifetime cancer risk estimates on the order of 10(-6)-10(-7). The lifetime average daily dose (LADD) for PCBs was less than 10% of the reference dose (RfD) 0.02 microg/kg day, which is based on immunosupression in monkeys. The LADD corresponding to the total site attributable exposure was less than 10% of the estimated average dietary PCB intake in Finland. Children can, however, in worst cases be exposed to daily doses near the level of the RfD. Low cost measures are recommended to reduce possible exposure of children.
10966519	Previous research has demonstrated the sensitivity of the developing rat to the hypothyroxinemic and ototoxic effects of perinatal exposure to Aroclor 1254 (A1254). We tested the hypothesis that postnatal exposure via lactation is the major cause of the ototoxicity by cross fostering animals at birth. Primiparous rats (22-24/dose) received 0 or 6 mg/kg A1254 (po in corn oil) from gestation day (GD) 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. On the day of birth, half of the treated litters and half of the control litters were cross-fostered, resulting in the following groups: Ctrl/Ctrl (controls); A1254/A1254 (perinatal exposure); A1254/Ctrl (prenatal exposure only); and Ctrl/A1254 (postnatal exposure only). We assessed offspring at a number of ages for: serum thyroid hormone concentrations, liver and brain concentrations of PCBs, body weight, mortality, age of eye opening, auditory startle amplitudes, and auditory thresholds for 1 kHz and 40 kHz tones. Circulating thyroxine (T(4)) concentrations were sharply reduced at GD 21 in the A1254-exposed group, and on PND 3, 7, 14, and 21 in the A1254/A1254 and the Ctrl/A1254 groups. Smaller decreases in T(4) were observed in the A1254/Ctrl group on PND 3, 7, and 14. PCB concentrations in the liver on PND 21 were sharply elevated in the A1254/A1254 and Ctrl/A1254 groups. Much smaller increases were seen in the A1254/Ctrl group. Age of eye-opening and startle amplitudes were unaffected by treatment. A1254 exposure caused permanent hearing deficits (20 dB increase) at the low frequency (1 kHz) in the A1254/A1254 and Ctrl/A1254 groups. The present findings demonstrated that the critical period for the ototoxicity of developmental A1254 exposure is within the first few postnatal weeks in the rat. This effect is consistent with the greater degree of postnatal hypothyroxinemia resulting from the greater magnitude of exposure that occurs postnatally via lactation.
7878673	This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of perinatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB; Aroclor 1254) exposure on hepatic and plasma retinoid levels in fetal rats, their dams, and neonatal and adult offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were treated with 0, 5, or 25 mg Aroclor 1254/kg body wt from Days 10 to 16 of gestation. Hepatic retinoid (retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinyl stearate) levels were determined in fetuses and dams from Day 20 of gestation, in male and female neonates 21 days postpartum, and in young adult offspring 90 days after birth. Retinol levels were determined in fetal and maternal plasma (Gestation Day 20) and plasma from the offspring 21 and 90 days after birth. Maternal and fetal plasma retinol levels were decreased by 35 and 38% on Day 20 of gestation following exposure to the highest dose of Aroclor 1254. Male, but not female, neonatal plasma retinol levels were significantly decreased (23%) in the high-dose group. No effects of PCB treatment were seen on plasma retinol levels in the offspring 90 days after birth. Only slight reductions in fetal and maternal hepatic retinol and retinyl palmitate concentrations were observed after prenatal PCB exposure. Male neonatal hepatic retinyl palmitate levels were reduced by 25 and 50% in the 5 and 25-mg Aroclor 1254/kg dose groups, respectively, while female neonatal hepatic retinyl palmitate levels were significantly reduced only in the high-dose group. Ninety days after birth, male hepatic retinyl palmitate levels were only slightly reduced in the highest dose group; however, hepatic retinol concentrations were significantly reduced by 50% in both PCB treatment groups. Female adult offspring exhibited significant reductions in hepatic retinyl palmitate levels (25%) in both PCB treatment groups, while hepatic retinol levels exhibited an unusual increase of more than 100% of controls in the low-dose group, while levels in the high-dose group were similar to controls. This study demonstrates that even a relatively low maternal dose of Aroclor 1254 results in long-term alterations in retinoid status of the offspring in the rat.
20691776	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent lipophilic environmental contaminants which are found in fatty tissues of humans and wild-life alike. Maternal transfer of PCBs to offspring is easily achieved across the placenta and via lactation. In male rats, perinatal PCB exposure induces behavioral abnormalities, in addition to hypothyroxinemia and white matter changes. There are sex differences in white matter volume synthesis and density in adult and aged rodents. Yet whether PCB exposure effects on white matter are sex-specific is unclear, because the previous studies were conducted in male offspring. Furthermore, although hypothyroxinemia induced by PCB exposure is thought to trigger white matter changes, PCBs also affect interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and IL-6 regulates white matter growth. We hypothesized that perinatal PCB exposure would have sex-specific effects on white matter development associated with altered IL-6 levels. We found that female offspring had higher levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) than males did, at postnatal day (PND) 7, 18 and 21. PCB exposure induced hypothyroxinemia in males and females at PND7, 14, 21, and 42. PCB exposure also increased MBP and reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in males at PND21, but had the opposite effect in females. In addition, at PND14 and 21, PCB exposure elevated IL-6 levels in male offspring only. The induction of sex-specific changes in white matter proteins, in the absence of sex differences in thyroxine levels after PCB exposure, suggests that serum thyroxine levels do not directly contribute to the white matter alterations. Instead, IL-6 may contribute to increased MBP levels in males, whereas in females estromimetic and thyromimetic PCB metabolites may affect white matter development. This data adds to an increasing body of literature showing that perinatal insults induce sex-specific effects in offspring.
22298765	A method for determination of concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB-28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 156, and 187) and organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, delta-hexachlorocyclohexane, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene, o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane, alpha-chlordane, gamma-chlordane, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, and aldrin) in human serum is developed. Recovery is assessed with artificial serum, in which PCBs and OCPs could not be detected. The method is then confirmed with pooled human serum. Experiments are performed by adding two concentrations of analytes (0.5 µg/L and 1.0 µg/L) to both matrices. The sample pretreatment process involves denaturing with a mixture of water-1-propanol (v:v, 85:15), extraction with a C-18 cartridge, and cleanup with an Alumina B cartridge. This process required about 2 mL of serum. The limit of detection ranged from 0.05-0.35 µg/L for all the analytes. Recovery of analytes at low and high spiking concentrations varied from 63-122% and 61-124% for artificial serum and pooled human serum, respectively. Relative standard deviation was lower than 16% and 18% for artificial serum and pooled human serum, respectively. Stability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, was lower than 14%. The method has been applied in epidemiological research.
15006515	The aim of the present study was to gain knowledge about the disposition of the PCB congeners 126 and 153 in a goat model where pregnant does were given oral doses of PCB from day 60 of gestation until delivery. The goat kids were thus exposed to PCB during gestation and lactation. The doses of PCB 153 and PCB 126 were 98 and 49 ng/kg body wt/day, respectively. PCB levels were measured in plasma from the does at day 90 of gestation and at delivery, and in plasma from the kids at birth and four weeks post partum. Concentrations of PCB were analysed in brain, liver and fat tissue from the does six weeks after delivery and in liver and fat tissue from the kids at nine months of age. The ratio of estimated body burden to ingested dose in the does, was 0.95 +/- 0.07 for PCB 153 and 0.41 +/- 0.03 for PCB 126. Approximately 9% of PCB 153 and 6% of PCB 126 was transferred from the mothers to their kids during gestation and lactation. Prenatal exposure contributed to a much lower fraction of the body burden than postnatal PCB intake via milk, due to the fact that almost 100% of the PCB 153 transferred from the does to kids was transferred via milk, and the PCB 126 intake via milk was threefold higher than the calculated body burden. The hepatic PCB 126 concentration in both does and kids was significantly higher than the concentration in fat, in contrast to PCB 153, where the highest concentrations were found in fat. A significant difference in body burden between the does at delivery, the newborn kids, and the kids at four weeks of age, did not influence the plasma concentration of PCB 153 on a fat weight basis, which showed no difference with sampling time. Our results suggest that PCB 126 and PCB 153 have different pharmacokinetic properties. The higher levels of PCB 126 in liver tissue compared to fat tissue confirm the concept of hepatic sequestration. The similar blood concentration of PCB 153 in the does at delivery and their newborn kids despite the considerable difference in body burden, suggests a high degree of placental transfer. This supports previous observations that low molecular weight, lipid-soluble, non-polar chemicals reach the fetus to the greatest possible extent. For PCB 153, the body burden may provide the appropriate dose metric at steady state, but may give a minor underestimation of PCB 126 at low environmental exposure levels due to hepatic sequestration.
8593850	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are important environmental contaminants, and their toxicity to wildlife and humans are of major concern. PCBs form persistent and abundant metabolites, PCB methyl sulfones, that accumulate in biota. We now report that certain hydroxylated PCB metabolites show a strong and selective accumulation in mammalian blood. Plasma from experimentally PCB-dosed rats and blood from environmentally exposed grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and humans were analyzed. Among all possible hydroxylated metabolites of PCB that may be formed, only a few, dominated by 4-OH-2,3,5,3',4'-pentachlorobiphenyl and 4-OH-2,3,5,6,2',4',5'-heptachlorobiphenyl, were found in the blood samples. All identified compounds have a structure with the hydroxy group in a para or meta position, with chlorine atoms on vicinal carbon atoms. The concentrations of hydroxylated PCB in the blood were almost in the same range as the most persistent PCB congeners both for seals and humans.
9624420	AIM: To study how polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) affect fetal growth and the expression of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF II) gene in the mink (Mustela vision). METHODS: Ten female mink were each exposed to 0.65 or 1.3 mg Clophen A50/day, respectively, during the reproductive season. The numbers and sizes of viable fetuses were recorded. The expression of the IGF II gene was studied by northern blotting using a mink specific IGF II cDNA probe. RESULTS: The number of viable fetuses decreased after PCB exposure in a dose dependent fashion. Expression of the IGF II gene in adult livers from PCB exposed animals was decreased, compared with control animals, in a dose dependent fashion. In contrast, IGF II expression in placentas and fetuses was unaltered. Furthermore, the maternal excretion of urinary cortisol increased in both exposed groups during the implantation period. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the IGF II gene is downregulated by PCB exposure in the adult liver. There is also an indication that the regulation of the expression of this gene differs between adult and fetal life. 
11734345	An investigation was conducted to detect residues of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in blood serum samples collected from a cohort of fasting females attending the health insurance outpatient clinic at Port Said between July 1999 and July 2000. Females involved in the study included 43 females diagnosed with invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast, 21 female suffering benign breast disease, and 11 normal healthy females. Serum was separated and its contents of DDE and PCBs were extracted and determined, using gas chromatography, equipped with electron capture detector. Mean residues of DDE detected in the three examined groups of females were 41+/-5.2, 48+/-6.2 and 31+/-2.5ng/g for breast cancer cases, benign breast disease cases and controls, respectively, indicating some significantly less residues in blood serum of control females. While PCBs residues detected were 54+/-17, 59+/-23 and 61+/-21ng/g, for the three groups, respectively. Residues of DDE detected in all females alike in the present study are about 15 times higher than residues detected in Canada and The Netherlands.
8603654	Blood lead levels (BPb) and serum polychlorinated biphenyl levels (PCB) were obtained from 17 employees at two adjacent scrap metal dealers. One facility was located outdoors, directly on top of soil known to be contaminated with lead and PCBs, and the other was located indoors with a concrete floor. BPbs ranged from 4.0 to 39.8 microgram/dl (mean 19.9 microgram/dl, geometric mean 17.5 microgram/dl) and PCB levels ranged from <1 to 65.3 ppb (mean 7.5 ppb). There was no significant difference in either BPb or serum PCB between the two sites. BPb was significantly correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked at work, and both BPb and serum PCB were significantly related to eating lunch outside the lunchroom, suggesting hand-to-mouth contact as a source of exposure. The lack of difference in BPb between employees of the two scrap metal dealers suggests an ongoing source of lead exposure at the sites, other than the soil.
20850584	Persistent organic pollutants remain a serious threat to many food-chain systems. New pollutants continue to emerge. The present study has created novel extraction vessels which are compatible with readily available commercial instrumentation to validate the analysis of one class of persistent organic pollutants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in avian blood. The volumes used can be reasonably sampled without sacrificing individuals, or comprising breeding or migratorial success. The procedure consists of the pressurized solvent extraction (PSE) of analytes in a novel PSE extraction vessel. The new extraction cell contains a 38-cm long, coiled, re-packable, in situ clean-up column. Lipid elimination, using Florisil, occurs within the coiled region of the extraction vessel, eliminating the requirement for post extraction clean-up. For development, 0.2 g samples of chicken whole blood have been used. Extract volumes are reduced from (30 to 10) cm(3), compared to unmodified systems. The new PSE vessel with its integrated clean-up method showed satisfactory performance for the analysis of ten environmentally relevant PCB congeners in chicken whole blood samples with recoveries in the range of (70-130)%. Detection limits using gas chromatography coupled with large volume injection ion-trap mass spectrometry (GC-LVI-ITMS-MS) were in the range of (0.05-0.5) ng g(-1). The relative standard deviations for all congeners investigated were better than 5%. This is the first PSE validation to have been conducted on unaltered whole blood samples.
20345174	Persistent chemicals accumulate in the arctic environment due to their chemical reactivity and physicochemical properties and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are the most concentrated pollutant class in polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Metabolism of PCB and polybrominated biphenyl ether (PBDE) flame-retardants alter their toxicological properties and these metabolites are known to interfere with the binding of thyroid hormone (TH) to transthyretin (TTR) in rodents and humans. In polar bear plasma samples no binding of [125I]-T(4) to TTR was observed after incubation and PAGE separation. Incubation of the plasma samples with [14C]-4-OH-CB107, a compound with a higher binding affinity to TTR than the endogenous ligand T(4) resulted in competitive binding as proven by the appearance of a radio labeled TTR peak in the gel. Plasma incubation with T(4) up to 1 mM, a concentration that is not physiologically relevant anymore did not result in any visible competition. These results give evidence that the binding sites on TTR for T(4) in wild living polar bears are completely saturated. Such saturation of binding sites can explain observed lowered levels of THs and could lead to contaminant transport into the developing fetus.
21997443	OBJECTIVES: Exposure to high concentrations of persistent organochlorines may cause fetal toxicity, but the evidence at low exposure levels is limited. Large studies with substantial exposure contrasts and appropriate exposure assessment are warranted. Within the framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO (ENvironmental Health RIsks in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the combination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) adversely affects birth weight. METHODS: We used maternal and cord blood and breast milk samples of 7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12 European birth cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable definitions, we performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on estimates of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE adjusted for gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary estimates by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions. RESULTS: The median concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L (range of cohort medians 20-484 ng/L) and that of p,p´-DDE was 528 ng/L (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L). Birth weight decreased with increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after adjustment for potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The meta-analysis including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g [95% confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g] per 1-µg/L increase in PCB-153, an exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the cohorts. A 1-µg/L increase in p,p´-DDE was associated with a 7-g decrease in birth weight (95% CI: -18, 4 g). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that low-level exposure to PCB (or correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to p,p´-DDE does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level exposure to PCBs is inversely associated with fetal growth. 
9681525	The organochlorines, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) are pervasive environmental contaminants. Results from previous studies have been conflicting regarding the relationship between the internal dose of these organochlorine residues and breast cancer risk. To determine whether these compounds are present in breast cyst fluids and whether cyst fluid and plasma concentrations are correlated, we analyzed organochlorines in paired cyst fluid and plasma samples from 24 subjects using gas chromatography and electron capture detection. All but one of the women had a history of multiple cysts, suggesting that they were at elevated risk for future breast cancer. DDE (a metabolite of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was present in 22 of the cyst samples and PCB was detected in 19 of the cyst samples. Organochlorine levels were more concentrated in the plasma than in breast cyst fluids. Levels of DDE in plasma were significantly correlated with those in cyst fluid (r = 0.73; P < 0.001); in contrast to PCB levels in cyst and plasma (r = 0.37; P = 0.12). Congener specific analysis of the PCBs showed that some individual congeners were preferentially excluded from or concentrated in the cyst fluid. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that PCB and DDE are present in cyst fluids and thus in contact with the ductal epithelium of the breast. These results support the use of plasma DDE as a proxy for DDE in the target tissue in research on the role of environmental factors in breast cancer.
1899992	As part of a study to evaluate the effect of chemical contaminants on Wisconsin sport fish consumers, measurements were made of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in human blood sera. A high resolution gas chromatography procedure was employed, with 13 individual congeners used as standards. Analytical recoveries and precision were greater than 90% and replicates were always within +/- 30%. Total concentrations, obtained by summing quantified congeners, ranged from 0.6 to 27.1 micrograms/L. Conventional packed column PCB analysis, conducted on a subset of samples, gave higher total PCB results. On a congener specific basis, congeners 153 (245-245), 138 (234-245), 180 (2345-245) and 118 (245-34) were found most often. These congeners have been reported to be prominent in other matrices. Of the congeners found, 118, 138, and possibly 180 are potentially the most toxic (based on current toxicological information).
11133402	Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins is associated with changes in the T-cell lymphocyte population in healthy Dutch infants. We investigated whether these changes persist into later childhood and whether background exposure to PCBs and dioxins is associated with the prevalence of infectious or allergic diseases and humoral immunity at preschool age. The total study group consisted of 207 healthy mother-infant pairs. We estimated prenatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins by the sum of PCBs 118, 138, 153, and 180 (sigmaPCB) in maternal and cord plasma and in breast-fed infants by the dioxin, planar, and mono-ortho PCB toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels in human milk. At 42 months of age, current body burden was estimated by the PCB in plasma. We assessed the prevalence of infectious and allergic diseases by parent questionnaire, and measured humoral immunity by antibody levels for mumps, measles, and rubella after primary vaccination. We performed immunologic marker analyses of lymphocytes in a subgroup of 85 children. Prenatal PCB exposure was associated with an increased number of lymphocytes, T-cells, and CD3CD8(+) (cytotoxic), CD4(+)CD45RO(+) (memory), T-cell receptor (TcR) [alpha]ss(+), and CD3(+)HLA-DR(+) (activated) T cells and lower antibody levels to mumps and measles at preschool age. Adjusted for confounders, prenatal PCB exposure was associated with less shortness of breath with wheeze, and current PCB body burden was associated with a higher prevalence of recurrent middle-ear infections and of chicken pox and a lower prevalence of allergic reactions. A higher dioxin TEQ was associated with a higher prevalence of coughing, chest congestion, and phlegm. We conclude that in Dutch preschool children the effects of perinatal background exposure to PCBs and dioxins persist into childhood and might be associated with a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases. Common infections acquired early in life may prevent the development of allergy, so PCB exposure might be associated with a lower prevalence of allergic diseases.
14757379	A study was conducted with the objective of assessing how dietary, occupational, and residential exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contribute to body burden among pregnant Mohawk women residing near three hazardous waste sites. From 1992 to 1995, 111 pregnant women were interviewed about fish consumption and other environmental risk factors and donated a 20-mL venous blood sample for serum PCB analysis. To supplement previous fish sampling, samples of residential soil, ambient air, wild duck, and local meats and vegetables were also collected and analyzed for PCBs. The results indicated a significant decline in local fish consumption from an annual mean of 31.3 meals more than 1 year prior to pregnancy to an annualized mean of 11.7 meals during pregnancy. This change was reportedly a result of the advisories issued against consumption of local fish by pregnant and nursing women of childbearing age. The geometric mean concentration of total PCBs in the serum was 1.2 ppb, a level that is similar to that in other studies of women with no unusual exposures to PCBs. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that serum levels of total PCBs and three individual congeners were associated with local fish consumption. The PCB levels in soil, air, and local foodstuffs other than fish generally were not elevated, except for those obtained in close proximity to one of the hazardous waste sites, and no association was found between serum PCB levels and exposure through these media or through occupation.
18201376	BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants identified worldwide as human blood and breast milk contaminants. Because they bioaccumulate, consumption of meat, fish, and dairy products predicts human blood concentrations. PCBs were also used widely in building materials, including caulks and paints, but few studies have evaluated the contribution of these exposures to body burden. METHODS: In an earlier study, we detected PCBs in indoor air in 31% of 120 homes on Cape Cod, MA. Two of the homes had much higher concentrations than the rest, so we retested to verify the initial finding, evaluate blood PCB concentrations of residents, and identify the PCB source. RESULTS: Air and dust concentrations remained elevated over 5 years between initial and follow-up sampling. Blood serum concentrations of PCBs in residents of the homes were generally elevated above the 95th percentile of a representative sample of the US population. Serum concentrations in residents and air and dust concentrations were especially high in a home where a resident reported use of PCB-containing floor finish in the past, and where the floor of one room was sanded and refinished just prior to sample collection. CONCLUSION: This case-study suggests that PCB residues in homes may be more significant contributors to overall exposure than diet for some people, and that use of a commercially-available PCB-containing wood floor finish in residences during the 1950s and 1960s is an overlooked but potentially important source of current PCB exposure in the general population. 
22569275	We examined the association between prenatal and postnatal exposure to PCBs and development at age 24 months as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. 44 (85%) of 52 children had information available. When prenatal and postnatal exposure were modeled together, we found no association between total PCB exposure and the mental development index (MDI) or the physical development index (PDI). In examining PCB 153, we found no association between PCB 153 and MDI, while higher levels of postnatal exposure was associated with a decrease in PDI after adjustment [β for highest tertile=-24.9; 95% CI (-44.3, -5.5)]. Higher levels of prenatal PCB 153 exposure were associated with a statistically significant increased odds of screening positive for a motor delay. In sum, when prenatal and postnatal exposures were considered together, breast milk exposure to PCB 153 appears to be associated with decrements in motor development; however, we cannot rule out that the finding was due to chance.
22735367	Impact of prenatal PCB exposure on birth weight was investigated in various children cohorts and findings of published studies show inconsistencies. Because a direct comparison of results obtained from different studies remains difficult, the "biological concentration-birth weight" relationship is not clearly established. The objective of this research was to perform a systematic analysis of published epidemiological data to reassess relationship between prenatal PCB exposure and low birth weight, using toxicokinetic considerations and a novel standardization procedure of biological concentration data across studies. A systematic analysis of 20 epidemiological studies published up to 2011 on this topic was conducted. This was achieved through a standardization of reported exposure data in terms of total PCBs per kg of lipids in maternal plasma. Systematic analysis of the "standardized biological concentration-birth weight" relationship across studies was then conducted through the application of Hill criteria. Combining results of all 20 reviewed studies did not allow to establish an association between prenatal exposure to PCBs at the described levels and abnormal birth weight (<2500g). Our approach provides a framework for the use of published data to establish "PCB biological concentration-response" relationships.
16530805	We measured organochlorine concentrations of 15 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and six organochlorine pesticides (PCB28, 52, 101, 123(+149), 118, 114, 153, 105, 138(+163), 167, 156(+171), 157, 180, 170, 189, alpha-, beta-, gamma-HCH, HCB, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE) in 2047 subjects from contaminated and background areas of eastern Slovakia. Data were collected in 2001 and analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection in 2002-2003. Elevated levels persist in subjects from Michalovce district, site of former production facility, after almost 20-years since the end of the PCB manufacturing. Sum of 15 PCB congeners was 3105 ng/g of lipid in the Michalovce district versus 871 ng/g of lipid for subjects from the background districts of Svidnik and Stropkov. Relatively high concentration in children from the Michalovce district, sum PCB = 766 ng/g of lipid versus 372 ng/g of lipid in children from background area suggest ongoing exposure from environmental reservoirs and contaminated food. Consistent differences between genders in both contaminated and background areas are reported here. Levels in males are about 20% higher in both districts. Levels of organochlorine pesticides, particularly of DDT metabolite DDE and hexachlorobenzene are also elevated in the Michalovce district, reflecting intensive use of pesticides in agriculture in the past. About 30% decrease in serum organochlorine levels was observed in comparison with our earlier samples collected in 1998. These results suggest that contamination with PCBs still remains a source of relatively high environmental exposure for subjects in the Michalovce district.
10092425	The preponderance of evidence in humans suggests that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-induced behavioral deficits result from prenatal exposure rather than exposure through breast milk, although a recent study reported lower psychomotor scores during infancy associated with PCB concentration in breast milk. In the current study, monkeys were dosed from birth to 20 weeks of age with a PCB congener mixture representative of the PCBs found in human breast milk. Blood and fat levels of PCB-exposed monkeys at the end of the dosing period were within the range observed in the general human population, while levels in control monkeys were below averages observed in humans in industrialized countries. Behavioral assessment on a series of tasks was performed when monkeys were between 2.5 and 5.0 years of age. Robust deficits were observed on spatial delayed alternation, fixed interval, and differential reinforcement of low rate performance. No group differences were observed for the number of errors on a series of nonspatial and spatial discrimination reversal tasks. Behavioral deficits included retarded learning, perseverative behavior, and inability to inhibit inappropriate responding. These results have implications for the potential contribution of exposure to PCBs through breast milk to behavioral impairment.
16042274	Thirty-six polychlorinated biphenylols (OH-PCBs) congeners were characterized in Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) eggs collected from the Faroe Islands. The seven most abundant congeners were quantified in 19 samples, and the sigmaOH-PCB concentrations ranged between 0.92 and 4.0 ng g(-1) fresh weight (f.w.). These eggs constitute a part of the traditional diet for at least a part of the population on the Faroe Islands and may contribute to the high levels of these contaminants found in the blood of pregnant Faroese women. Because the metabolites are present in the nonhatched fulmar egg, it is concluded that the OH-PCBs are transferred to the egg before laying. High levels, 3300-18,000 ng g(-1) l.w., of sigmapolychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) were determined in the fulmar eggs, which are a considerable source for human exposure. The high PCB levels are a source for metabolic formation of hydroxylated PCBs.
3106647	In rats and humans chronically exposed to large amounts of PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) and PCDF (polychlorinated dibenzofurans), the urinary excretion of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin are altered. However, porphyrin excretion in humans after acute transient low level exposure has not been evaluated. Following such an exposure in which bystanders and firefighters were in contact with smoke from a PCB transformer fire, we surveyed 90 self-referred individuals by questionnaire and by determining single 24 hour urinary excretion of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin 2-4 weeks after the fire. Questionnaire variables that assessed exposure were not associated with the magnitude of either uroporphyrin or coproporphyrin excretion. Uroporphyrin excretion was slightly elevated in nine subjects (range 66-106 micrograms/24 hours, normal less than 60), which is much less than in clinical cases of porphyria cutanea tarda. Uroporphyrin excretion was inversely correlated with coproporphyrin excretion (r = -0.3844, p = 0.0002). For 5 subjects (3 with elevated initial uroporphyrin excretion) retested at 3-4 weeks after the fire, all 5 showed increases in uroporphyrin and decreases in coproporphyrin excretion when compared to initial determinations. These two reciprocal relationships would be the expected result from inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, a known experimental effect of PCB and PCDF in mice. Overall, urinary porphyrin excretions were not altered or sensitive measures of exposure.
18940895	BACKGROUND: Consumption of fish contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and prenatal PCB serum concentrations have been associated with a longer time-to-pregnancy (TTP). However, the relationship between preconception serum PCBs concentrations and TTP has not been previously studied. METHODS: Eighty-three women (contributing 442 menstrual cycles) planning pregnancies completed daily diaries regarding menstruation, intercourse, home pregnancy test results, and reported use of alcohol and cigarettes. TTP denoted the number of observed menstrual cycles required for pregnancy. Preconception blood specimens underwent toxicologic analysis for 76 PCB congeners via gas chromatography with electron capture; serum lipids were quantified with enzymatic methods. A priori, PCB congeners were summed into a total and three groupings-estrogenic, anti-estrogenic and other-and entered into discrete analogs of Cox models with time-varying covariates to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FOR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic PCB concentrations (ng/g serum) conferred reduced FORs in fully adjusted models (0.32; 95% CI 0.03, 3.90 and 0.01: 95% CI < 0.00, 1.99, respectively). Reduced FORs (0.96) were observed for alcohol consumption standardized to a 28-day menstrual cycle in the same adjusted model (FOR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93, 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that environmental exposures including those amenable to change, such as alcohol consumption, may impact female fecundity. The findings are sensitive to model specification and PCB groupings, underscoring the need to further assess the impact of chemical mixtures on sensitive reproductive outcomes, such as TTP, especially in the context of lifestyle factors which are amenable to change, thereby improving reproductive health. 
15121506	Six polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), one hexabromobiphenyl [polybrominated biphenyl (PBB)], and one hexachlorobiphenyl [polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)] were measured in 40 human serum pools collected in the southeastern United States during 1985 through 2002 and in Seattle, Washington, for 1999 through 2002. The concentrations of most of the PBDEs, which are commercially used as flame retardants in common household and commercial applications, had significant positive correlations with time of sample collection, showing that the concentrations of these compounds are increasing in serum collected in the United States. In contrast, PCB and PBB levels were negatively correlated with sample collection year, indicating that the levels of these compounds have been decreasing since their phaseout in the 1970s.
11888842	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with possible hormone-disrupting effects is capable of affecting sexual differentiation in boys at the age of puberty. DESIGN: Following analysis for PCB in their umbilical cords, 196 boys from a Faroese birth cohort were examined for the development of puberty at 14 years of age. METHODS: Physical examination included determination of Tanner stages and testicular size. A morning urine sample was centrifuged and examined for the presence of sperm. Serum was analyzed for sex hormones. RESULTS: twenty boys (10.2%) had abnormalities in testicular development, mainly cryptorchidism. only three of them had a positive spermaturia test, but the level of exposure to pcbs in this group had not been increased. occurrence of spermaturia in 58 of the remaining 176 boys was also not associated with pcb exposure but showed highly significant associations with tanner stages and testicular size. serum concentrations of testosterone, fsh and lh were higher in boys with spermaturia, while sex hormone-binding globulin was lower and no difference occurred in inhibin b. serum hormone parameters showed only weak associations with the level of prenatal pcb exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the validity of spermaturia as a useful indicator of puberty, although a substantial rate of false negatives must be taken into account. Despite the wide range of exposure to PCB, the findings did not reveal any definite associations with the development of puberty. However, because of the limited size of the cohort, small effects cannot be excluded. 
22187485	Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners differentially reduce serum thyroxine (T(4)) in rats, but little is known about their ability to affect biliary excretion of T(4). Thus, male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered Aroclor-1254, Aroclor-1242 (32 mg/kg per day), PCB-95, PCB-99, PCB-118 (16 mg/kg per day), PCB-126 (40 μg/kg per day), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (3.9 μg/kg per day), or corn oil for 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, [(125)I]T(4) was administered intravenously, and blood, bile, and urine samples were collected for quantifying [(125)I]T(4) and in bile [(125)I]T(4) metabolites. Serum T(4) concentrations were reduced by all treatments, but dramatic reductions occurred in response to Aroclor-1254, PCB-99 [phenobarbital (PB)-type congener], and PCB-118 (mixed-type congener). None of the treatments increased urinary excretion of [(125)I]T(4). Aroclor-1254, PCB-118, TCDD, and PCB-126 (TCDD-type congener) increased biliary excretion of T(4)-glucuronide by 850, 756, 710, and 573%, respectively, corresponding to marked induction of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity toward T(4). PCB-95 and PCB-99 did not induce UGT activity; therefore, the increased biliary excretion of T(4)-glucuronide was related to the affinity of congeners for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The disappearance of [(125)I]T(4) from serum was rapid (within 15-min) and was increased by Aroclor-1254, PCB-99 and PCB-118. Thus, reductions in serum T(4) in response to PCBs did not always correspond with UGT activity toward T(4) or with increased biliary excretion of T(4)-glucuronide. The rapid disappearance of [(125)I]T(4) from the serum of rats treated with PB-like PCBs suggests that increased tissue uptake of T(4) is an additional mechanism by which PCBs may reduce serum T(4).
3930667	Because polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been implicated as potentially toxic to humans and because the electric utility industry is thought to have significant opportunity for occupational exposure, a study was performed to identify electric utility personnel with the highest PCB exposure potential and to assess their current blood PCB concentrations. For currently employed personnel, a median PCB plasma value of 3 ppb with a mean of 4 +/- 3.65 ppb was found; for a preemployment sample the median was 4 ppb with a mean of 5 +/- 4.25 ppb. PCB concentrations in blood of these personnel are similar to concentrations reported for other populations without occupational exposure. No adverse health impacts would be expected to result from these blood concentrations. These data indicate that no significant occupational exposure has occurred in this utility. This study shows the importance of assessing exposure potential at specific worksites prior to making general exposure or hazard assessments.
