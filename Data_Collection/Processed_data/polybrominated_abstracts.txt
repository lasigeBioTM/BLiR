22406104	A quantitative method that requires only a small volume (50μL) of blood has been developed for the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Target analytes in both plasma sample (DBSV) and dried blood spot (DBS) were analyzed by a gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometer (GC/HRMS). Measurements of standard reference materials by the developed method were in agreement with those certified values. Linear correlation coefficients were found to be 0.9984 and 0.9965 for DBS and DBSV analysis, respectively. Other analytical criteria, such as limits of detection, recoveries, precision, accuracy and linearity of the proposed method are also reported. From recovery studies, the addition of formic acid to the extraction solvent was found to be effective in extracting PBDEs and PCBs from filter paper. The PBDE and PCB levels in spiked DBS were monitored at room temperature for up to 30 days and the variations of target analytes were found to be insignificant. Our results suggest that DBS sampling technique is feasible for PBDE and PCBs biomonitoring in human population.
18786695	Commercial aircrafts need a high degree of fire protection for passenger safety. Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), may be used for this purpose. Because PBDEs readily absorb to dust particles, aircraft crew and passengers may receive significant PBDEs exposure via inhalation. The aims of this work were to assess whether PBDEs could be found in aircraft cabin dust and whether serum levels of PBDEs increased in passengers after long-distance flights. Hence nine subjects on intercontinental flights collected cabin dust samples, as well as donated blood samples before departure and after return to Sweden. Two subjects who were domestic frequent flyers were also investigated. The levels of PBDEs in dust and serum were determined by GC/MS in electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) mode. Authentic reference substances were used for identification and quantitation. PBDEs were found in all aircraft dust samples at high concentrations, higher than in common household dust. Congener patterns indicated that the technical products PentaBDE, OctaBDE and DecaBDE were used in the aircrafts. Serum concentrations in the travellers were similar to those observed in Swedish residents in general. Post-travel serum levels of BDE-28, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, and BDE-154 were significantly higher (p<0.05) than concentrations prior to travel. The findings from this pilot study call for investigations of occupational exposures to PBDEs in cabin and cockpit crews.
18978342	Previous studies demonstrated that perinatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a major class of brominated flame retardants, may affect thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations by inducing hepatic uridinediphosphate-glucoronosyltransferases (UGTs). This study further examines effects of the commercial penta mixture, DE-71, on genes related to TH metabolism at different developmental time points in male rats. DE-71 is predominately composed of PBDE congeners 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 with low levels of brominated dioxin and dibenzofuran contaminants. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were orally administered 1.7 (low), 10.2 (mid), or 30.6 (high) mg/kg/day of DE-71 in corn oil from gestational day (GD) 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. Serum and liver were collected from male pups at PND 4, 21, and 60. Total serum thyroxine (T(4)) decreased to 57% (mid) and 51% (high) on PND 4, and 46% (mid) dose and 25% (high) on PND 21. Cyp1a1, Cyp2b1/2, and Cyp3a1 enzyme and mRNA expression, regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and pregnane xenobiotic receptor, respectively, increased in a dose-dependent manner. UGT-T(4) enzymatic activity significantly increased, whereas age and dose-dependent effects were observed for Ugt1a6, 1a7, and 2b mRNA. Sult1b1 mRNA expression increased, whereas that of transthyretin (Ttr) decreased as did both the deiodinase I (D1) enzyme activity and mRNA expression. Hepatic efflux transporters Mdr1 (multidrug resistance), Mrp2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein), and Mrp3 and influx transporter Oatp1a4 mRNA expression increased. In this study the most sensitive responses to PBDEs following DE-71 exposure were CYP2B and D1 activities and Cyb2b1/2, d1, Mdr1, Mrp2, and Mrp3 gene expression. All responses were reversible by PND 60. In conclusion, deiodination, active transport, and sulfation, in addition to glucuronidation, may be involved in disruption of TH homeostasis due to perinatal exposure to DE-71 in male rat offspring.
19217641	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Since the 1970s, PBDEs have been widely used as additive flame retardants in furniture and electronic equipment. Due to their wide use and persistent nature, these chemicals are found in the environment, human blood, breast milk and other tissues in increasing levels in recent decades. PBDEs are similar to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in structure and toxicity. However, unlike PCBs and PCDDs/PCDFs, the route of PBDE exposure is not almost exclusively through food. PBDE levels in US food are not markedly higher than in Europe, although US human blood and milk levels are an order of magnitude higher. For these reasons, other possible routes of PBDE exposure have been investigated to understand PBDE intake into humans. PBDE contaminated clothes dryer lint and household dust are indicators of indoor contamination and may be sources of human exposure through hand-to-mouth contact or dermal absorption. There are very few publications about PBDEs in US or European lint. Household dryer lint from 12 US and seven German homes were analyzed for PBDEs by gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We found the median US total PBDE levels were more than 10 times higher than median German levels and the mean US levels were two times higher than mean German levels. The US levels ranged from 321 to 3073ngg(-1) (median: 803ngg(-1), mean: 1138ngg(-1)) and the German levels were from 330 to 2069ngg(-1) (median: 71ngg(-1), mean: 361ngg(-1)). PBDE contamination of lint was found in all samples; the source of the PBDEs may be from dryer electrical components and/or dust deposition onto clothing.
18589988	To investigate the occupational exposure levels to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), indoor dust (n = 3) in workshops and hair samples from male workers (n = 64) were collected at two electrical and electronic equipmentwaste (E-waste) dismantling factories located in the LQ area in east China in July 11--13, 2006. Pre- and postworkshift urines (64 of each) were also collected from the workers to study oxidative damage to DNA using 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) as a biomarker. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PCDD/F-WHO-TEQs, PBDEs, PCBs and PCB-WHO-TEQs were (50.0 +/- 8.1) x 10(3), 724.1 +/- 249.6, (27.5 +/- 5.8) x 10(6), (1.6 +/- 0.4) x 10(9), (26.2 +/- 3.0) x 10(3) pg/g dry weight (dw) in dust, and (2.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(3),42.4 +/- 9.3, (870.8 +/- 205.4) x 10(3), (1.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(6), 41.5 +/- 5.5 pg/g dw in hair, respectively. The homologue and congener profiles in the samples demonstrated that high concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs, and PCBs were originated from open burning of E-waste. The 8-OHdG levels were detected at 6.40 +/- 1.64 micromol/mol creatinine in preworkshift urines. However, the levels significantly increased to 24.55 +/- 5.96 micromol/mol creatinine in postworkshift urines (p < 0.05). Then, it is concluded that there is a high cancer risk originated from oxidative stress indicated by the elevated 8-OHdG levels in the E-waste dismantling workers exposed to high concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PBDEs, and PCBs.
16580039	In experimental animals fed standard laboratory diets, penta-BDE mixtures can decrease circulating thyroid hormone and liver vitamin A concentrations. A substantial number of pregnant women and their children have marginal vitamin A status, potentially increasing their risk of adverse effects to penta-BDE exposure. The current study investigated the effects of maternal gestational and lactational penta-BDE exposure on thyroid hormone and vitamin A homeostasis in rats of sufficient vitamin A (VAS) or marginal vitamin A (VAM) status and their offspring. Dams were administered daily oral doses of 18 mg/kg DE-71 (a penta-BDE mixture) or a corn oil vehicle from gestation day 6 through lactation day (LD) 18. Thyroid hormone and vitamin A homeostasis were assessed in plasma and tissues of LD 19 dams and postnatal day (PND) 12, 18, and 31 pups. DE-71 exposure induced hepatomegaly in VAS and VAM pups at all timepoints and increased testes weights at PND 31. While liver vitamin A concentrations were low in DE-71 treated dams and pups, plasma retinol concentrations and plasma retinol binding protein levels were only low in VAM animals exposed to DE-71. DE-71 exposure lowered plasma thyroxine concentrations in VAS and VAM dams and pups. Plasma thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were high in VAM dams exposed to DE-71, suggesting that marginal vitamin A status enhances the susceptibility to thyroid hormone axis disruption by DE-71. These results support the concept that marginal vitamin A status in pregnant women may increase the risk for PBDE-induced disruptions in vitamin A and thyroid hormone homeostasis.
17637922	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) behave as weak estrogens in animal and cell culture bioassays. In vivo metabolites of PBDEs are suspected to cause these effects. OBJECTIVES: To identify candidate metabolites, mouse plasma samples were collected after continuous oral and subcutaneous exposure to DE-71, a widely used commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether product, for 34 days. METHODS: Samples were extracted, separated into neutral and phenolic fractions, and analyzed by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In the plasma samples of orally treated animals, 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-153) represented 52% of total measurable PBDEs, whereas it represented only 4.3% in the DE-71 mixture. This suggested that BDE-153 was more persistent than other congeners in mice. Several metabolites were detected and quantitated: 2,4-dibromophenol, 2,4,5-tribromophenol, and six hydroxylated PBDEs. The presence of the two phenols suggested cleavage of the ether bond of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) and 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99), respectively. The hydroxylated (HO)-PBDEs might come from hydroxylation or debromination/hydroxylation. Among the quantitated hydroxylated metabolites, the most abundant was 4-HO-2,2',3,4'-tetra-BDE, which suggested that there was a bromine shift during the hydroxylation process. para-HO-PBDEs have been proposed to behave as endocrine disruptors. CONCLUSIONS: THERE SEEM TO BE THREE METABOLIC PATHWAYS: cleavage of the diphenyl ether bond, hydroxylation, and debromination/hydroxylation. The cleavage of the diphenyl ether bond formed bromophenols, and the other two pathways formed hydroxylated PBDEs, of which para-HO-PBDEs are most likely formed from BDE-47. These metabolites may be the most thyroxine-like and/or estrogen-like congeners among the HO-PBDEs. 
16331726	A method based on gas chromatography (GC) separation followed by ion trap tandem mass spectrometry detection in EI mode (ITD-MS/MS), using isotope dilution, was developed for the determination of ten native polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and four (13)C(12)-labeled congeners in biological (fat tissue and human serum) and food samples. The highest-mass fragment ions were used as precursor ions for those congeners with molecular ions with m/z values higher than the maximum of the instrument. In these cases (hepta-BDEs and (13)C(12)-hexa-BDEs) no fragmentation was achieved under the experimental conditions employed. Repeatability (lower than 9%) and reproducibility (lower than 13%), expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 3 and 4, respectively), were satisfactory. Similarly, the coefficient of variation (n = 4) of the isotopic ratio between the two most abundant product ions was lower than 10 and 6% for native and labeled congeners, respectively. To evaluate the feasibility of the method, the optimized isotope dilution GC/ITD-MS/MS method was used for the quantitation of selected PBDE congeners in different samples including adipose tissue, human serum and foodstuff samples, from three inter-laboratory comparative exercises, covering a wide range of concentrations. A solid-phase extraction procedure, previously developed for PCB determination in small-size bird serum samples, was successfully applied to quantification of PBDEs in 1 mL samples of human serum.
21783878	Experimental studies suggest that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) can influence thyroid function, although the few human studies reported provide little support for this premise. Great Lakes sportfish anglers represent a population with potentially elevated dietary exposure to PBDEs due to the lipophilic nature of these compounds. Thirty-six licensed anglers who participated in the New York State Angler Cohort Study donated blood and completed questionnaires regarding demographic, clinical and sportfish consumption information. Archived blood specimens were analyzed for thyroid stimulating hormone, total and free thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, total serum lipids and nine PBDE congeners. PBDE congener profiles were dominated by BDE-47 (median=7.9ng/g lipids), BDE-153, and BDE-99 (medians=1.8ng/g lipids). No significant associations were observed between congeners, or their sum (ΣPBDEs), and thyroid function. However, the possibility of a positive association between ΣPBDEs and fT(4), detectable with an approximate ninefold increase in sample size, suggests that additional studies are needed.
11055623	Accidental contamination of the Michigan food chain with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) led to the exposure of more than 4,000 individuals in 1973. Because PBB exposure is suspected to disrupt endocrine function, we assessed pubertal development in females 5-24 years of age (N = 327) who were exposed to PBB in utero and, in many cases, through breastfeeding. We estimated in utero PBB exposure using maternal serum PBB measurements taken after exposure (1976-1979) and extrapolated to time of pregnancy using a model of PBB decay. We found that breastfed girls exposed to high levels of PBB in utero (> or =7 parts per billion) had an earlier age at menarche (mean age = 11.6 years) than breastfed girls exposed to lower levels of PBB in utero (mean age = 12.2-12.6 years) or girls who were not breastfed (mean age = 12.7 years). This association persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (menarche ratio = 3.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-9.0). Perinatal PBB exposure was associated with earlier pubic hair stage in breastfed girls, but little association was found with breast development. The associations observed here lend support to the hypothesis that pubertal events may be affected by pre- and postnatal exposure to organohalogens.
21658843	High concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their structural analogues (such as methoxylated (MeO) and hydroxylated (OH) PBDEs) had been observed in environmental samples and human tissues. This study evaluated the occurrence, potential source and human exposure of these organobrominated compounds via market fish consumption in Hong Kong. The contamination of 22 PBDEs, 7 MeO-BDEs, 15 OH-BDEs and 3 bromophenols (BRPs) were analyzed in 20 fish species (279 samples). The estimated daily intakes of PBDEs, MeO-BDEs, OH-BDEs and BRPs via fish consumption ranged from 4.4 to 14, 0.50 to 4.3, 0.02 to 0.43 and 0 to 0.21 ng/kg day for Hong Kong residents, respectively, based on 50(th) and 95(th) centile concentrations. BDE-47 and 99 were found to be the major PBDE congeners while 2'-MeO-BDE-68, 6-MeO-BDE-47 and 3-MeO-BDE-47 were the dominant MeO-BDEs. Concentrations of OH-BDEs and BRPs were 10-100-fold less than those of PBDEs, with small frequencies of detection (max 36.7%). Dietary intake of PBDEs via fish consumption by Hong Kong residents was greater than many developed countries, such as the USA, UK, Japan and Spain. To our knowledge, this is the first report to estimate the dietary intake of MeO/OH-BDEs and BRPs via fish consumption. Our results indicated that the toxicity potential of these compounds should not be neglected.
22311549	The incidence of cats being diagnosed with feline hyperthyroidism (FH) has increased greatly since it was first described in 1979. The cause of FH has not been established. Hypothetically, there is a link between increasing FH and exposure to brominated flame retardants. Much greater polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) concentrations have been reported in cat serum compared with human serum, likely due to cat licking behaviour. This study aimed to extend the present identification of brominated compounds in cat serum, with a focus on hydroxylated metabolites of PBDE, to improve the understanding of feline metabolism of PBDEs. A pooled serum sample from 30 Swedish pet cats with FH was analysed, and brominated species were identified. The results showed exposure to the discontinued flame retardant decabromobiphenyl (BB-209) and technical penta- and octa-BDEs. Altogether 12 PBDE congeners were identified along with 2'-MeO-BDE68. Furthermore, 2,4-dibromophenol, 2,4,6-, 2,4,5- and 2,3,4-tribromophenol plus 2'-OH-BDE68, 6-OH-BDE47, 5-OH-BDE47, 4'-OH-BDE49 were identified. 2,4,6-tribromophenol and 6-OH-BDE47 were the most prominent species in cat serum. Considering that these are natural products, it can be concluded that metabolism of PBDEs to OH-PBDEs is not a major route of PBDE elimination in cats. It is notable that BB-209, 6-OH-BDE47, and 2,4,6-tribromophenol all suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals were present in high concentrations in cat serum.
18183045	The Michigan Long-Term PBB Study was established following exposure to polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in the early 1970s. Serum samples from cohort members were analyzed for PBB during 1976-1993. More than 20 years following this industrial incident, some participants still had measurable serum PBB concentration levels. Thus, there is continuing interest in understanding the elimination of PBB from the body. In the present study, we estimated serum PBB decay and investigated the effects of covariates on serum PBB decay rates among 406 female cohort members. We developed a decay model using a general linear mixed model, which attributes unique intercept and slope estimates for each individual while borrowing information across individuals for predicting these quantities. Age at exposure and body mass index (BMI) at the initial measurement were time-independent covariates. Time since exposure, smoking history, pregnancy status, and breast-feeding status were time-dependent covariates. Higher BMI was associated with a slower decay rate; smokers had a faster decay rate than nonsmokers; and increasing age at exposure was marginally associated with a slower decay rate. Our results suggest a faster serum PBB decay rate for women who breast-fed during the interval between serum PBB measurements. To evaluate the predictive performance of our modeling approach, we compared the results from this model with those from a previously developed ordinary least squares (OLS) two-stage decay model. The mixed-effects decay model predicted the observed serum PBB concentration levels significantly better than the OLS two-stage decay model (mixed-effects model, r=0.93; OLS two-stage model, r=0.86; P<0.0001).
17109919	This study was conducted to examine PBDE exposure in Koreans, with a special focus on incinerator workers due to their potential for occupational exposure to PBDEs. A total of 92 blood samples from 30 incinerator workers, 51 nearby residents and 11 controls were analyzed. The mean total PBDE concentration calculated from the 13 most concentrated congeners for all samples was 16.84+/-7.48 ng/g lipid, which was somewhat higher concentration than in other countries except North America and Canada. The PBDE levels and congener profiles detected in incinerator workers were not distinctly different from those found in the general population. In all groups tested, BDE-47 was dominant (mean contribution=32.5%) followed by BDE-153 (23.6%) and relatively high portions of BDE-183 (16.5%) were found. No strong trend was observed between PBDE levels and a number of key biological factors examined in this study, however, weak correlations were observed in PBDE levels measured against dietary habits, particularly in fish consumption frequency and gender. Overall, our data suggest that the occupational exposure of incinerator workers to PBDEs can be considered minor, while other lifestyle factors can have a greater contribution to PBDE exposure.
21491934	Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) body burdens in the general U.S. population have been linked to the consumption of red meat and poultry. Exposure estimates have also indicated that meat products are a major contributor to PBDE dietary intake. To establish solid estimates of PBDE concentrations in domestic meat and poultry, samples from two statistically designed surveys of U.S. meat and poultry were analyzed for PBDEs. The two surveys were conducted in 2002-2003 and 2007-2008, between which times the manufacturing of penta-BDE and octa-BDE formulations had ceased in the United States (December 2004). Thus, the data provided an opportunity to observe prevalence and concentration trends that may have occurred during this time frame and to compare the mean PBDE levels among the meat and poultry industries. On the basis of composite samples, the average sum of the seven most prevalent PBDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, and -183) decreased by >60% from 1.95 ng/g lipid in 2002-2003 to 0.72 ng/g lipid in 2007-2008 for meat and poultry. PBDEs measured in individual samples in 2008 showed that beef samples had the lowest PBDE levels followed by hogs and chickens and then by turkeys. The PBDE congener pattern was the same for both surveys and resembled the penta-BDE formulation with BDE-47 and -99 accounting for 30 and 40% of the total, respectively. On the basis of the data from the two surveys, it appears that PBDE levels in U.S. meat and poultry have declined since manufacturing ceased; however, exposure pathways of PBDEs to livestock are still not known.
11999787	Gas chromatography coupled to low-resolution mass spectrometry with electron capture negative ionization as detection mode (GC-LRMS (ECNI)) has been compared to gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry using electron ionization as detection mode (GC-HRMS (EI)) for determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in biological samples. Extracts of 5.0 g plasma, serum and milk samples were analyzed using both methods. The GC-LRMS (ECNI) and GC-HRMS (EI) systems were found to be equally well suited for determination of PBDEs in the biological samples, as well as in standard solutions, with respect to response, detection limits and repeatability at the pg-level. The estimated limits of detection (LOD) in milk extracts ranged from 0.3-0.6 pg PBDE/g milk and 0.4-0.7 pg PBDE/g milk, for the GC-LRMS (ECNI) and GC-HRMS (EI) systems, respectively. The method repeatability including sample preparation was in the range 4.7-8.4% and 0.6-10% relative standard deviation (RSD) for the GC-LRMS (ECNI) and GC-HRMS (EI) systems, respectively.
6299210	Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) concentrations in specimens from adult males and females were used to determine the distribution of PBBs in body tissues and the partitioning ratio between types of tissues. Specimens of serum, adipose tissue, biliary fluid, and feces were tested by gas chromatography. In addition, parturient women provided breast milk, placenta, and cord blood for testing. There was a significant correlation between serum and adipose PBB levels. Pregnant and nonpregnant women and male chemical workers had similar serum to adipose tissue concentration ratios, which ranged from 1:140 to 1:260. Males from farms had a significantly different ratio of 1:325-329. Potential exposure to the fetus and newborn was demonstrated. Cord blood contained one-tenth of the concentration found in maternal serum which indicated partial placental passage. Human milk contained PBBs at 107 to 119 times the quantity found in maternal serum. Polybrominated biphenyls were detectable in bile and feces demonstrating transfer into the intestinal tract. The concentration of PBBs in feces represented a minor proportion of the total body burden indicating a slow rate of excretion.
15805045	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a type of brominated flame retardant chemically and toxicologically similar to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are a class of emerging environmental and human contaminants. They have recently been detected in U.S. milk, blood, and food at the highest levels in the world. This pilot study was undertaken with the aim of determining levels of PBDE in the U.S. indoor environment, to assess the potential exposure to PBDEs from computer surfaces and carpets. Food of animal origin is the usual source of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), and PCBs in humans, but there may also be environmental sources for intake of PBDEs. It was also our aim to characterize the PBDE congener profile in these indoor environmental samples. Four computer wipe samples and 9 domestic vacuum-sweeping samples were analyzed for 13 PBDE congeners, PBDEs 17 (2,2',4), 28 (2,4,4'?), 47 (2,2',4,4'?), 66 (2,3',4,4'?), 77 (3,3',4,4'?), 85 (2,2',3,4,4'?), 99 (2,2'4,4',5), 100 (2,2',4,4',6), 138 (2,2',3,4,4',5'?), 153 (2,2',4,4',5,5'?), 154 (2,2',4,4',5,6'?), 183 (2,2',3,4,4',5',6), and 209 (2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'?). All samples tested positive for PBDEs. PBDE 209 was the dominant congener in all 4 computer wipe samples and in 7 out of the 9 vacuum dust samples. The congener profiles observed in this study varied considerably, a finding that has been observed previously. However these congener profiles differ from the pattern seen in U.S. human milk, human blood and in food, where PBDEs 47 and 99 predominate.
20664651	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of brominated flame retardants added to plastics, polyurethane foam, electronics, textiles, and other products. These products release PBDEs into the indoor and outdoor environment, thus causing human exposure through food and dust. This study models PBDE dose distributions from ingestion of food for Irish adults on congener basis by using two probabilistic and one semi-deterministic method. One of the probabilistic methods was newly developed and is based on summary statistics of food consumption combined with a model generating realistic daily energy supply from food. Median (intermediate) doses of total PBDEs are in the range of 0.4-0.6 ng/kg(bw)/day for Irish adults. The 97.5th percentiles of total PBDE doses lie in a range of 1.7-2.2 ng/kg(bw)/day, which is comparable to doses derived for Belgian and Dutch adults. BDE-47 and BDE-99 were identified as the congeners contributing most to estimated intakes, accounting for more than half of the total doses. The most influential food groups contributing to this intake are lean fish and salmon which together account for about 22-25% of the total doses.
23506475	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants in the past three decades. These compounds are lipophilic and easily cross the placenta from pregnant woman to fetus. It is not clear whether hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), with greater hydrophilicity, have different concentrations in maternal and cord serum samples. We analyzed PBDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -209) and OH-PBDEs (6-OH-BDE-47, 5-OH-BDE-47, 4'-OH-BDE-49, 5'-OH-BDE-99) in 20 pairs of maternal and cord serum samples collected in Cincinnati, OH in 2011. The geometric mean concentration of ∑OH-BDEs (the sum of four OH-PBDEs) was 49.76 pg/mL in cord sera, higher than 32.84 pg/mL in maternal sera. Similarly, cord serum total BDEs had a higher geometric mean than maternal serum (45.51 vs 32.07 ng/g lipid). Equal or higher levels of total OH-BDEs and total BDEs in cord serum were observed in 85% and 80% of the mother-neonate pairs, respectively. The study suggests fetuses might receive higher OH-PBDE and PBDE exposure than their mothers.
22572169	Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PDBEs) are exogenous, bioactive compounds that originate, to a large extent, from anthropogenic activities, although they are also naturally produced in the environment. In the present study nine new authentic OH-PBDE reference standards and their corresponding methyl ether derivatives (MeO-PBDEs) were synthesised and characterised by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Seven of the authentic reference standards prepared were thereafter tentatively identified in a pooled human blood sample. The tentatively identified OH-PBDEs were 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether, 3'-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether, 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether, 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether, 3'-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether, 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether and 4-hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptabromodiphenyl ether. An additional seven OH-PBDEs were tentatively identified in the pooled human blood sample, of which one OH-PBDE, 4'-hydroxy-2,2',4,5,5'-pentabromodiphenyl ether, has not been identified in human blood before. The identification was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) recording the bromine ions m/z 79, 81. The tentative identification was supported by the peaks relative retention times (RRTs) compared to authentic references on two GC columns of different polarities for the hexa-, and heptabrominated OH-PBDEs, and three different GC columns for the pentabrominated OH-PBDEs. The OH-PBDE congeners most likely originate from human metabolism of a flame retardant, i.e. polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), due to the relatively high concentrations of PBDEs in the same human blood sample and the fact that these PBDEs could form the tentatively identified OH-PBDEs via metabolic direct hydroxylation or via 1,2-shift.
21663902	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), widely used as flame retardants since the 1970s, have exhibited endocrine disruption in experimental studies. Tetra- to hexa-BDE congeners are estrogenic, while hepta-BDE and 6-OH-BDE-47 are antiestrogenic. Most PBDEs also have antiandrogenic activity. It is not clear, however, whether PBDEs affect human reproduction. OBJECTIVES: The analysis was designed to investigate the potential endocrine disruption of PBDEs on the age at menarche in adolescent girls. METHODS: We analyzed the data from a sample of 271 adolescent girls (age 12-19 years) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2004. We estimated the associations between individual and total serum BDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, and -154, lipid adjusted) and mean age at menarche. We also calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for menarche prior to age 12 years in relation to PBDE exposure. RESULTS: The median total serum BDE concentration was 44.7ng/g lipid. Higher serum PBDE concentrations were associated with slightly earlier ages at menarche. Each natural log unit of total BDEs was related to a change of -0.10 (95% CI: -0.33, 0.13) years of age at menarche and a RR of 1.60 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.28) for experiencing menarche before 12 years of age, after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: These data suggest high concentrations of serum PBDEs during adolescence are associated with a younger age of menarche. 
17079016	In utero exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) reduces the number of ovarian follicles in rat females and causes permanent effects on rat males. Little data have been gathered on the associations between PBDEs exposure and birth outcome and female menstruation characteristics in both epidemiological and animal studies. The aim of this study was to examine how PBDEs in breast milk are associated with infant birth outcome and maternal menstruation characteristics. Study participants were healthy women recruited from central Taiwan between December 2000 and November 2001. Twelve congener levels of PBDEs (BDE-17, 28, 47, 66, 85, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183, 209) in 20 breast milk samples were measured by gas chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometer. The mean level of PBDEs in breast milk was 3.93+/-1.74 ng/g lipid. The estimated PBDE daily intake for a breastfed infant was 20.6 ng/kg b.w./day after delivery. After maternal age, pre-pregnant BMI, and parity were adjusted, increased PBDEs in breast milk was related with decreased birth outcome, particularly for birth weight and length, chest circumference, and Quetelet's index of infants. No significant differences in PBDEs were found between the two groups of menstrual cycle length higher and lower than 30 days after we adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnant BMI, and parity. In utero exposure to low doses of PBDEs may result in lower birth weight and short or birth length. Our findings are limited based on the low doses of PBDEs and the small sampling size.
17256492	Concentrations of 15 BDEs flame retardants have been determined in a large variety of food samples purchased in different markets across Spain. This is the first time that BDEs 184, 191, 196, and 197; impurities from BDEs formulations; and/or degradation products of BDE 209, have been detected in foodstuffs. Values ranged from <0.01 to 2482 pg/g fresh weight. The highest total BDE concentrations were found in fish samples (median of 189, range of 24-880 pg/g f.w.), followed by oils (median of 119, range of 14.8-2958 pg/g f.w.), meats (median of 75.9, range of 6.82-2518 pg/g f.w.), shellfish (median of 75.7, range of 3.29-677 pg/g f.w.), eggs (median of 73.5, range of 12.8-557 pg/g f.w.), and dairy products (median of 66.1, range of 3.24-1588 pg/g f.w.). The total BDE values found in this study are consistent with research reported elsewhere. They are in the same range as those recently reported by other European and Asian studies and lower than those conducted in the U.S. BDE 47 was the predominant congener in fish, shellfish, dairy products (except butter), and meats, while BDE 209 was the predominant in oil and egg samples. The most remarkable findings in this study were the large contribution of the highest brominated BDEs (hepta- to deca-BDE), and principally BDE 209, to the total BDE concentration found in Spanish foods, except fish and shellfish, and the presence of BDE 184, 191, 196, and 197 in many of the samples. The calculated intake of 38.5 ng/day of BDEs was comparable to intake assessment from other UE countries.
17617441	Understanding the influence of maternal exposures on gestational age and birth weight is essential given that pre-term and/or low birth weight infants are at risk for increased mortality and morbidity. We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) through accidental contamination of cattle feed and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) through residual contamination in the geographic region. Our study population consisted of 444 mothers and their 899 infants born between 1975 and 1997. Using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, no significant association was found between estimated maternal serum PBB at conception or enrollment PCB levels and gestational age or infant birth weight in unadjusted models or in models that adjusted for maternal age, smoking, parity, infant gender, and decade of birth. For enrollment maternal serum PBB, no association was observed for gestational age. However, a negative association with high levels of enrollment maternal serum PBB and birth weight was suggested. We also examined the birth weight and gestational age among offspring of women with the highest (10%) PBB or PCB exposure, and observed no significant association. Because brominated compounds are currently used in consumer products and therefore, are increasingly prevalent in the environment, additional research is needed to better understand the potential relationship between in utero exposure to brominated compounds and adverse health outcomes.
15121506	Six polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), one hexabromobiphenyl [polybrominated biphenyl (PBB)], and one hexachlorobiphenyl [polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)] were measured in 40 human serum pools collected in the southeastern United States during 1985 through 2002 and in Seattle, Washington, for 1999 through 2002. The concentrations of most of the PBDEs, which are commercially used as flame retardants in common household and commercial applications, had significant positive correlations with time of sample collection, showing that the concentrations of these compounds are increasing in serum collected in the United States. In contrast, PCB and PBB levels were negatively correlated with sample collection year, indicating that the levels of these compounds have been decreasing since their phaseout in the 1970s.
17702599	A novel method for the analysis of four polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in environmental and human serum samples based on hollow fiber-liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) followed by gas chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (GC-ICP-MS) detection has been developed. The organic solvent in the porous hollow fiber was first dipped into the sample for extraction at a given time, and the retracted organic phase was introduced into the GC-ICP-MS for analysis. The addition of methanol has a strong effect on the HF-LPME extraction efficiency. Other significant parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of HF-LPME were also studied. HF-LPME was effective to isolate the analytes from the complex matrix. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limits of the proposed method varied from 15.2 to 40.5 ng/L. In general, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 10%. Good linearity was obtained with the correlation coefficients all better than 0.999. The proposed method is simple, quick, few microliters of organic solvent required, and is especially suitable for the analysis of the real sample with small amount available. The overall process of HF-LPME with GC-ICP-MS was applied successfully for the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in environmental and spiked human serum samples, and the results were satisfactory.
22819883	The use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is increasing annually in China. Although several studies have reported significant contamination by these compounds in biological samples in China, little is known about the factors that may influence the levels of exposure and the potential health risk for infants. We investigated PBDE exposure levels in breast milk, its influencing factors and the potential health risk for infants in Shanghai, China by enrolling 48 healthy women between September 2006 and April 2007. PBDE exposure was assessed by analyses of seven PBDE congeners in breast milk. The estimated daily intake of PBDEs by infants via breastfeeding was determined for evaluating the potential health risk for infants. The median (range) of total PBDE content in breast milk was 8.81 (1.92-41.55) ng/g lipid. 34 (71%) of the 48 samples tested positive for all seven congeners. Maternal education level and household monthly salary were positively associated with PBDE concentration in breast milk (r=0.337, p=0.019 and r=0.436, p=0.004, respectively). The median of estimated daily intake of BDE-99 (6.67 ng/kg/day) by infants via breastfeeding was below the human no adverse effect level (NAEL) set for BDE-99 for neurodevelopmental toxicity (18.8 ng/kg/day). However, 3 (6%) of the samples exceeded the human NAEL. Taking the high detection rate of PBDEs in breast milk together with 6% of their EDI higher than NAEL in Shanghai, more studies on the effects of maternal PBDE exposure on fetal growth and child neurodevelopment are warranted.
17521129	Polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and selected organochlorine pesticide concentrations were measured in blubber samples from 60 free-living harbor seals in 2003 from five sites around the United Kingdom coast. Significant regional differences among contaminant levels were found, with seals on Islay and Jura (southwest Scotland) having the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls and seals in the Wash (eastern England) having the highest polybrominated diphenyl ether levels. Animals from the north and northeast of Scotland (Orkney and the Moray Firth) had the lowest levels of all the contaminant groups studied. Congener-specific profiles of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers showed relatively higher levels of the lower chlorinated and brominated compounds at the more northerly sites, with the lowest total levels of both chemical groups. Significant positive relationships between blubber contaminants and total triiodothyronine (TT3) concentrations were found after controlling for the potential effects of confounding because of sex, mass, and season. Increased serum TT3 levels were significantly related to higher blubber contaminant concentrations in the following order: sum of all contaminants > polybrominated diphenyl ethers > polychlorinated biphenyls > DDT. Serum TT3 levels in the harbor seals with the highest exposures might be indicative of a T3 thyrotoxicosis, but without information on free T3 and circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, it is difficult to determine the importance of this observation for the health of the individuals or populations. However, the mixture of contaminants to which United Kingdom harbor seals are exposed has changed over the last few decades, and the toxicological and epidemiological importance of adding the brominated compounds to the classical organochlorine and heavy metal mixture is not known.
23582134	Women in the United States have breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are among the highest in the world, leading to concerns over the potential health implications to breastfeeding infants during critical stages of growth and development. Developing cost-effective and sustainable methods for assessing chemical exposures in infants is a high priority to federal agencies and local communities. PBDE data are available in nationally representative serum samples but not in breast milk. As a method to predict PBDE concentrations in U.S. breast milk, we present the development of congener-specific linear regression partitioning models and their application to U.S. serum data. Models were developed from existing paired milk and serum data and applied to 2003-2004 NHANES serum data for U.S. women. Highest estimated median U.S. breast milk concentrations were for BDE-47 (30.6 ng/g lipid) and BDE-99 (6.1 ng/g lipid) with the median concentration of Σ7PBDEs estimated at 54.2 ng/g lipid. Predictions of breast milk PBDE concentration were consistent with reported concentrations from 11 similarly timed U.S. studies. When applied to NHANES data, these models provide a sustainable method for estimating population-level concentrations of PBDEs in U.S. breast milk and should improve exposure estimates in breastfeeding infants.
16564120	Twenty-one-paired human fetal and maternal serum and 27 breast milk samples at South China were analyzed for concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Seven PBDE congeners (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, and -183) were quantified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). This is the first report to present the residue levels of PBDEs in human samples of China. The concentrations of total PBDEs ranged from 1.5 to 17 ng/g in the samples and were within the range reported in European samples for a similar population, but lower than human tissue levels in North America. BDE-47 and -153 were the dominant PBDE congeners in all samples and accounted for 60% of the total PBDEs. Further research is needed to determine the exposure route of PBDEs and their health effects.
205565	The toxicity of a commercial preparation of polybrominated biphenyl was determined in 24 pregnant Holstein heifers that were alloted randomly to one of four experimental groups given 0 (I), .25 (II), 250 (III), and 25,000 (IV) mg per day of fireMaster BP-6 for 60 days or until the animals became moribund. Clinicopathologic determinations were on day -1 prior to dosing, days 15, 30 and 60 during dosing, and following dosing on days 80, 110, 150, and 190 from start of dosing. In addition, samples were collected from moribund heifers of Group IV immediately prior to necropsy. Toxicity was not evident in heifers in Groups I, II, or III. Toxicity was induced in heifers in Group IV. Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase of serum was increased and calcium decreased as early as day 15 whereas significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase, urea nitrogen, and bilirubin, and decreases in albumin were not observed until day 30 in heifers of Group IV. Analysis of urine from moribund heifers of Group IV revealed moderate proteinuria and decreased specific gravity. Evaluation of clinicopathologic data has suggested that the polybrominated biphenyls fed were renal toxins with no clear evidence of hepatotoxicity.
17239850	Accidental contamination of livestock in Michigan in 1973 with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) led to the establishment of a registry of exposed individuals in 1976. At the time of enrollment, serum was collected and analyzed for PBBs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In 1997, women aged 18 years or older and active in the registry were invited to participate in a telephone interview about their health. Using generalized estimating equations to account for correlated outcomes within the same woman, we assessed the risk of spontaneous abortion among 529 women with 1344 potentially exposed pregnancies. PBB and PCB exposure were not associated with risk of spontaneous abortion after adjusting for maternal age at conception, age at menarche, and prior infertility. Compared to pregnancies with PBB exposure below the limit of detection, those with levels above 2.9 ppb had a non-significant reduced odds of spontaneous abortion (adjusted OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.47-1.13). Compared to pregnancies with PCB exposure below the limit of detection, those with levels above 6.5 ppb had little difference in risk (adjusted OR=0.91; 95% CI=0.59-1.41). Maternal age at conception above 34 years was significantly associated with elevated risk of spontaneous abortion (OR=2.46; 95% CI=1.10-5.49). The effect of prior infertility was of borderline significance (OR=1.52; 95% CI=0.98-2.38). Older age at menarche was associated with decreased risk of spontaneous abortion (adjusted OR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.38-0.89, comparing menarche at 12-13 with menarche <12). Our results do not support an association between exposure to PBBs or PCBs and risk of spontaneous abortion.
23434819	Polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs), including the decabromodiphenyl congener (BDE-209), were determined in the serum of 731 individuals from a general adult population (18-74 years) collected in 2002 in Catalonia (north-eastern Spain). The BDE-209 was the predominant congener (median 3.7 ng/g lipid) followed by BDE-47 (2.6 ng/g lipid) and BDE-99 (1.2 ng/g lipid). PBDEs in this population (median 15.4 ng/g lipid) ranked amongst the highest of previously described concentrations in populations in Europe, Asia, New Zealand and Australia, yet it was lower than those found in North American reports. Age was clearly the socio-demographic factor of highest influence on the PBDE distributions. However, unlike usual trends of higher accumulation of POPs through age, the higher concentrations were found in young individuals (<30 years) rather than in adults (≥30 years), with differences of 14%, 31% and 46% in the most abundant congeners (i.e. BDE-209, BDE-99 and BDE-47, respectively). This age-dependent distribution of PBDEs (including the case for BDE-209, which is shown for the first time in this study) is explained by the higher and widespread use of these compounds since the 1980s. In view that these compounds remain highly used, this accumulation pattern is likely to evolve, anticipating an increasing level of PBDE concentrations in future general population surveys, yet probably assuming an age-dependent increase pattern. Socio-economic level was also a determinant of BDE-47 concentrations, but only relevant for the least affluent class, suggesting that lifestyle and environmental conditions in the dwelling place may also contribute to exposure. Nonetheless, gender, body mass index, place of birth, parity and education level did not show any statistically significant influence on the observed PBDE distributions.
11437459	The identification of host factors that are predictors of changes in serum polyhalogenated biphenyl contaminants over time has been a difficult challenge in epidemiologic studies of exposed individuals. Of particular concern are age at exposure, reproductive and lactational histories, and changes in body mass index. Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches, this study examined factors related to high initial serum PBB and PCB levels and changes in these levels over time among women of varying ages at exposure (n=1772; age range<1 to 45 years). In 1973, PBB exposure occurred through consumption of farm products contaminated with PBB added to cattle feed. Exposures to PCBs began in 1941 through PCB-contaminated silo sealant deteriorating into animal feed. The Michigan Department of Public Health began enrolling participants in 1977 and has continued to follow them through annual updates. At enrollment, questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric measurements, medical/reproductive and occupational histories, and contaminated food consumption patterns. Blood samples were collected for PBB and PCB analysis at enrollment for all participants; additional serum tests were done on a subset of the population during follow-up. Median serum levels at enrollment were 2.0 ppb PBB and 5.0 ppb PCB. A decline in serum PBB level over an interval that ranged from 1 to 146 months (median=31) was observed for 44.6% of the women (median=1.0 ppb), while 12.2% showed an increase (median=1.0 ppb). PCB levels declined in 50.3% of the women (median=3.0 ppb) while 12.2% increased (median=2.0 ppb). Relative to women whose contaminant levels were stable, higher initial serum level was a predictor of decline for both PBB and PCB (OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.52-1.82; OR=3.26, 95% CI 2.58-4.12, respectively); a yearly increase in interval between tests was related to declining PCBs (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.46-1.87). In addition, age< or =10 years at exposure (OR=1.72, 95% CI 1.03-2.86) and residence on a quarantined farm (OR=1.40, 95- CI 1.03-1.90) were predictors of a decrease in PBBs. Factors related to an increase in PBB levels were age< or =10 years at exposure (OR=0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.96) and initial PBB level (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.33); and for PCBs, high initial level (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) and body mass index (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13). One or more live births during the interval between tests were not related to changing levels of either contaminant; breastfeeding data were not available for examination. Early age at exposure appears to be an important predictor of changes in serum PBB levels over time.
23121987	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs) and hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) were detected and quantified in Brown Bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) from Lake Ontario. Samples were collected in 2006 from three different locations near the city of Toronto: Frenchman's Bay, Toronto Island, and Tommy Thompson Park. A total of 117 plasma samples were pooled into 19 samples, separating males and females by site of capture. Pooled samples were analyzed for 36 PBDEs, 20 MeO-PBDEs and 20 OH-PBDEs, but only six PBDEs, five MeO- and eight OH-compounds were confirmed against standards currently available. These peaks were quantified as "identified" peaks, while peaks matching ion ratios but not matching the retention time of the available standards were quantified as "unidentified" peaks. Both "identified" and "unidentified" concentrations were combined to obtain a total concentration. No significant variations were obtained for total PBDE concentrations, ranging from 3.33 to 9.02 ng g(-1)wet weight. However, OH- and MeO-PBDE totals ranged over 1 order of magnitude among the samples (not detected - 3.57 ng g(-1)wet weight for OH-PBDEs and not detected -0.10 ng/g wet weight for MeO-PBDE). The results of this study suggested that these compounds are ubiquitous in biota. Source estimation of MeO- and OH-PBDEs in freshwater fish were discussed. Considering that up to date no freshwater sources for MeO- or OH-PBDEs have been reported, concentrations found should be mainly related to bioaccumulation from anthropogenic sources, although other sources could not be dismissed.
10417362	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used as additives in polymers and textiles to prohibit the development of fires. Because of the production and use of PBDEs, their lipophilic characteristics, and persistence, these compounds have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The aim of the present study was to determine potential exposures of PBDEs to clerks working full-time at computer screens and personnel at an electronics-dismantling plant, with hospital cleaners as a control group. Five PBDE congeners--2,2',4,4'-tetraBDE; 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaBDE; 2,2',4,4',5, 6'-hexaBDE; 2,2',3,4,4',5',6-heptaBDE; and decaBDE--were quantified in blood serum from all three categories of workers. Subjects working at the dismantling plant showed significantly higher levels of all PBDE congeners in their serum as compared to the control group. Decabromodiphenyl ether is present in concentrations of 5 pmol/g lipid weight (lw) in the personnel dismantling electronics; these concentrations are comparable to the concentrations of 2,2',4, 4'-tetraBDE. The latter compound was the dominating PBDE congener in the clerks and cleaners. The major compound in personnel at the dismantling plant was 2,2',3,4,4',5',6-heptaBDE. Concentrations of this PBDE congener are almost twice as high as for 2,2',4, 4'-tetraBDE in these workers and seventy times the level of this heptaBDE in cleaners. The total median PBDE concentrations in the serum from workers at the electronics-dismantling plant, clerks, and cleaners were 37, 7.3, and 5.4 pmol/g lw, respectively. The results show that decabromodiphenyl ether is bioavailable and that occupational exposure to PBDEs occurs at the electronics-dismantling plant.
15516123	A new method using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and isotope dilution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-IDTOFMS) for the simultaneous measurement of selected polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and brominated flame retardants is presented. In contrast to the reference methods based on classical GC/MS, a single injection of the extract containing all compounds of interest results in accurate identification and quantification. Using GCxGC ensures the chromatographic separation of most compounds, and TOFMS allows mass spectral deconvolution of coeluting compounds as well as the use of (13)C-labeled internal standards for quantification. Isotope ratio measurements of the most intense ions for both native and labels ensure the required specificity. The use of this new method with an automated sample preparation procedure developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the analysis of human serum and milk compared favorably to conventional isotope-dilution one-dimensional gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-IDHRMS) for the different human serum and milk pools tested. The instrumental detection limits ranged between 0.5 pg/microL and 10 pg/microL and the method detection limits ranged between 1 and 15 pg/microL (N = 59 analytes). The reproducibility of the method was almost as good as with GC-IDHRMS, the relative standard deviations ranging between 1 and 11% for OCPs measured in human serum. OCP, PBDE, and PCB levels measured using the two methods were highly correlated, and the deviations between the two methods were below 20% for most analytes with concentrations above 1 ng/g milk lipids.
19540593	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been produced in the south coast area of Laizhou Bay, Shandong Province in China, but little is known about the PBDE exposure level of residents to these compounds. We set out to assess potential health risks of PBDEs in the south coast area of the Laizhou Bay by determining the concentrations of PBDEs in serum and breast milk. We measured concentrations of eight PBDE congeners in serum and breast milk. The arithmetic means of Sigma(8)PBDE in pooled serum and breast milk were 613 ng/g lipid and 81.5 ng/g lipid, respectively. The highest concentration for Sigma(8)PBDE in all serum pools was 1830 ng/g lipid from the 41-50 year old female group. BDE-209 was the predominant congener, with the mean concentrations of 403 ng/g lipid in serum and 45.6 ng/g lipid in breast milk, respectively. BDE-209 averagely accounted for 65.8% and 54.2% of the total PBDEs, respectively. Our results suggest that high exposures to PBDEs have led to very high PBDE concentrations in serum and breast milk from the residents living in the south coast area of Laizhou Bay. High PBDE concentrations in human serum, particularly in women, pose a potential public health threat to local residents.
21783486	The aim of the study was to follow plasma thyroxine levels and hepatic enzyme activities in offspring after maternal gestational and lactational exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls. Mice were given 10 equimolar oral doses from gestational day (GD) 4 to postnatal day (PND) 17 of either Bromkal 70-5DE, 2,2',4,4',5-pentabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-99) or Aroclor 1254 (total dose of 0.80mmol/kg, b.w.). Plasma thyroxine levels were reduced in offspring in the Aroclor and Bromkal groups on PND11 but had returned to control levels by PND37. No effects on thyroxine levels were seen in the dams. Hepatic activity of EROD was increased in all treated offspring groups and so was UDP-GT in Aroclor-exposed offspring on PND11 and PND18. This study shows that PBDEs and PCBs, probably after microsomal transformation, have endocrine disrupting properties in perinatally exposed juvenile mice, most pronounced at PND11. However, BDE-99 had no effect on thyroxine levels, suggesting that other components in Bromkal are responsible for the hypothyroxinemia.
17711197	This study examined human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) associated with fish consumption and inhalation in China. The median intake of sigma7 PBDEs via human milk was 48.2 ng/day for nursing infants (0-1 years old) (a range of 23.4-99.1 ng/day). For all other age groups, the median intake of sigma11 PBDEs via fish consumption was 1.7-12.9 ng/day with a range of 0.59-56.3 ng/g. Additionally, human exposure to PBDEs via inhalation was 2.7-9.2 ng/day (a range of 0.72-108 ng/day). The median total sigma11 PBDEs intakes for nursing infants (6874 and 7372 pg/ kg b.w./day for males and females, respectively) were much higher than other age groups (215-608 pg/kg b.w./ day). No significant difference in the total PBDEs intakes was found between males and females. Of the 11 PBDEs congeners, BDE-47 was predominant in the total intake for nursing infants with a mean contribution of 38%, whereas BDE-209 was the dominant congener of total intake for other age groups, varying from 44 to 61%. Currently, the PBDEs levels in Chinese consumer fish and the total intakes of PBDEs via fish consumption were at the lower end of the global range. Compared with similar studies in other countries, however, human exposure to PBDEs via inhalation in China was relatively high. Overall, estimated daily intake of total PBDEs in the Chinese population was far below the LOAEL. However, studies are needed to further understand the fate and impact of PBDEs as PBDE-containing products are still used widely in large quantities in China.
19664822	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are used as flame retardants in a wide variety of products. As part of the Integrated Exposure Assessment Survey (INES), this study aimed to characterize the exposure of an adult German population using duplicate diet samples, which were collected daily over seven consecutive days, and indoor air and house dust measurements. Our study population consisted of 27 female and 23 male healthy subjects, aged 14-60 years, all of whom resided in 34 homes in southern Bavaria. In these 34 residences the air was sampled using glass fiber filters and polyurethane foams and the dust was collected from used vacuum cleaner bags. The median (95th percentile) daily dietary intake of six Tetra- to HeptaBDE congeners was 1.2 ng/kg b.w. (3.3 ng/kg b.w.) or 67.8 ng/day (208 ng/day) (calculated from the 7-day median values of each study subject). Concentrations in indoor air and dust (cumulative Tri- to DecaBDE congener readings) ranged from 8.2 to 477 pg/m(3) (median: 37.8 pg/m(3)) and 36.6 to 1580 ng/g (median: 386 ng/g), respectively. For some congeners, we identified a significant correlation between air and dust levels. The median (95th percentile) blood concentration of total Tetra- to HexaBDE congener readings was 5.6 (13.2)ng/g lipid. No significant sex differences were observed, but higher blood concentrations were found in younger participants. Using a simplified toxicokinetic model to predict the body burden from exposure doses led to results that were of the same order of magnitude as the measured blood concentrations. Based on these measurements and given our exposure assumptions, we estimated for the total tetra- to heptabrominated congener count an average (high) comprehensive total daily intake of 1.2 ng/kg b.w. (2.5 ng/kg b.w.). Overall, our results suggest that dietary exposure is the dominant intake pathway at least in our study population, responsible for 97% (average intake) and 95% (high intake) of the total intake of an adult population.
22704218	Blood serum specimens from 81 non-occupationally exposed adults residing in four areas close to municipal and waste incinerators as well as metallurgical industry plant and 44 adult subjects coming from control area of Slovakia were analysed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs). The concentration of total WHO(98)TEQ PCDD/F/dl-PCBs in whole group of donors from areas where known sources causing dioxin contamination are present was significantly higher than in control group of donors (p<0.001). Correlation between the age of donors and PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels was confirmed (Spearman's r(PCDD/Fs)=0.543, r(dl-PCBs)=0.521, p<0.001). Furthermore, this study presents first results concerning the PBDE congeners in human serum of Slovak general population. The total concentration (congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) in control group was approximately 1.5-times higher in comparison to that of residents coming from areas with supposed environmental pollution. The most abundant congeners in all samples were BDE-47 and BDE-153 with median values of 0.24 ng g(-1) lipid and 0.23ngg(-1) lipid, respectively. The positive association between PBDE values and age of donors was not found.
22192581	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are used in high amounts as flame retardants in plastic materials and textiles. Due to their persistence, their accumulation in the food chain and their toxic properties they have been integrated in the human biomonitoring program of the Baden-Württemberg State Health Office since 2002. In repeated cross-sectional studies in winter 2002/03 (n=162), 2004/05 (n=194), 2005/06 (n=411) and 2008/09 (n=770) blood samples of 9-11-year-old pupils were taken, pooled and analysed for PBDE after extraction and purification by silica gel using HRGC/HRMS. Samples were pooled according to region, gender, and breast feeding. PBDE in the pooled samples ranged from 1.9 to 12.5 ng/g blood fat (sum of all PBDE). Mean concentrations of PBDE, calculated for the four investigation periods, were 6.2 ng/g (2002/03), 5.4 ng/g (2004/05), 7.8 ng/g (2005/06) and 6.7 ng/g (2008/09). While the concentration of the decabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-209) increased, the concentration of other congeners (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, BDE-183) decreased slightly or remained at the same level. Consistent differences with respect to gender and breast-feeding were not recognizable. Concentrations of PBDE in children range on the same level as in adults and do not seem to be critical from the toxicological point of view. Because of the slight increase of BDE 209, the internal concentrations of BDE should be monitored in the future. The strong variations in PBDE concentration between the different pooled samples indicate that, apart from ingestion, other routes of exposure (dermal, inhalation) and additional sources (textiles, building materials) must be taken into consideration.
20378148	Concentrations and congener specific profiles of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorine residues were measured in 22 pooled blood samples representing 66 children from both polluted areas (E-waste recycling region) and case control areas in Zhejiang province, China. To our knowledge, this is the first report on these pollutants in the blood of Chinese children. The mean concentrations of [summation operator]PCDD/Fs, [summation operator]PCBs, [summation operator]PBDEs, HCB and pp'-DDE in pooled blood samples from polluted areas (Luqiao) were 206+/-157 pg g(-1) lipid, 40.6+/-7.01 ng g(-1) lipid, 32.1+/-17.5 ng g(-1) lipid, 14.6+/-20.1 ng g(-1) lipid and 108+/-21.8 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. WHO-TEQ-2005 for PCBs and PCDD/Fs were 11.9+/-4.62 pg g(-1) lipid and 10.3+/-6.39 pg g(-1) lipid, respectively. The results showed that PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorine residues in the E-waste recycling area were significantly (P<0.001) higher than the case control areas. High levels of PCDD/Fs were detected in the case control area (Longyou), where Na-PCP had been widely sprayed to prevent snailborne schistosomiasis. The contamination levels and profiles were compared with those documented in previous publications.
18762292	A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the influence of sportfish consumption on body burden of nine polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in 36 New York State (NYS) anglers. Participating anglers who had previously reported consuming sportfish from Lake Ontario and its tributaries were found to have significantly higher blood plasma levels of BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, and the sum of measured PBDE congeners (SigmaPBDE), than anglers who had previously reported no consumption of sportfish from these waters. Bivariate analysis was used to evaluate potential dietary predictors of PBDE plasma levels, including indicators of consumption of sportfish, as well as commercial fish, wild waterfowl, dairy products, and beef. The number of years of reported consumption of Lake Ontario sportfish between 1980 and 1990 was found to be correlated with plasma levels of BDE-47, BDE-85, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, and SigmaPBDE. The number of meals, eaten in the year prior to study participation, of Lake Ontario sportfish species known to have high levels of other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was correlated with plasma levels of BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-85, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-154, and SigmaPBDE. Multiple linear regression revealed that the number of years consuming Lake Ontario sportfish between 1980 and 1990, after adjusting for plasma lipids, was a weak, but statistically significant, predictor of SigmaPBDE plasma levels (beta=0.130, 95% CI: 0.007-0.254). These results suggest that sportfish consumption can contribute measurably to PBDE body burden in NYS anglers, although there are likely to be additional, more significant, sources of exposure.
18335096	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are capable of disrupting thyroid hormone homeostasis. PBDE-47 (2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether) is one of the most abundant congeners found in human breast adipose tissue and maternal milk samples. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effects of developmental exposure to low doses of PBDE-47 on the female reproductive system. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were administered vehicle (peanut oil) or PBDE-47 [140 or 700 microg/kg body weight (bw)] on gestation day (GD) 6, or 5 mg 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)/L in the drinking water from GD7 through postnatal day (PND) 21. RESULTS: In female offspring sacrificed on PND38, there was a significant decrease in ovarian weight after exposure to PTU or 140 microg/kg PBDE-47. Alterations in folliculogenesis were apparent: we observed a decrease in tertiary follicles and serum estradiol concentrations in the offspring exposed to either PTU or 700 microg/kg PBDE-47. PTU exposure also resulted in a decrease in primordial follicles. On PND100, persistent effects on the thyroid glands included histologic and morphometric changes after exposure to either PTU or PBDE-47. No relevant changes in reproductive indices were observed after mating the exposed F1 females with nontreated males. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of PBDE-47 at doses relevant to human exposure led to changes in the rat female reproductive system and thyroid gland. 
18977567	We exposed female European starlings to a pentabromodiphenyl ether (Penta-BDE) mixture through subcutaneous implants, and examined levels and profiles of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) together with reproductive effects. Sum PBDE levels increased significantly in the serum of the exposed females from 218+/-43 to 23,400+/-2035 pg/ml. Sum PBDE concentrations in the eggs of the exposed group ranged from 130+/-12 to 220+/-37 ng/g wet weight (ww). The profile in serum after egg laying was very similar to that in eggs. There were no detectable levels of HO-PBDEs in both serum and eggs. Fewer females of the exposed group initiated egg laying compared to the control group, although the difference was not significant. In addition, egg weight and volume were significantly higher in the exposed group. These results suggest that, at the investigated exposure levels (150 microg sum PBDEs/bird), PBDEs may have a negative effect on reproductive performance.
17804034	Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in market fish have not previously been reported in Hong Kong. Axial and ventral muscles from 10 each common species of freshwater and marine fish purchased from markets in Hong Kong were analyzed for 22 PBDEs. Among the 10 freshwater fish species, spotted snakehead (Channa maculate) contained the highest level of PBDEs in ventral muscle (130 ng g(-1) wet wt.). For marine fish, bigeye (Priacanthus macracanthus) showed significantly higher levels of PBDEs (60.7 ng g(-1)wet wt. in ventral tissue) than all other marine species. The levels of PBDEs in fish samples ranged from 0.53 to 130 ng g(-1)wetwt. The tetrabrominated congener BDE-47 and pentabrominated BDE-99 were the predominant congeners, which accounted for 27% and 30%, respectively, of the total PBDEs. Daily PBDE intake was calculated according to the different fish consumption rate for Hong Kong consumers, and the results ranged from 222 to 1198 ng day(-1) for marine fish and 403-2170 ng day(-1) for freshwater fish. The daily PBDE intake from fish reported here were higher than those reported from the United States (8.94-15.7 ng day(-1)) and Europe (14-23.1 ng day(-1)).
22682894	A hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate the debrominated, hydroxylated and methoxylated metabolism of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, BDE-15, -28 and -47) in maize. A total of six debrominated metabolites (de-PBDEs), seven hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs, including two unidentified OH-di-PBDEs and one unidentified OH-tri-PBDE) and four methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs) were determined in the exposed plants. The metabolic products were detected in maize only after 12h of exposure to the PBDEs. However, the concentration of each type of the metabolites (de-PBDEs, OH-PBDEs or MeO-PBDEs) decreased at the later exposure time, possibly due to further metabolism. The removal of a bromine atom or the introduction of a hydroxyl/methoxy group was easier at the ortho-positions on the biphenyl structure than at the para-positions. Concentration ratios of the total debrominated, hydroxylated or methoxylated metabolites to the parent congener (BDE-28 or -47) generally followed the order of leaves>stems>roots, and MeO-PBDEs>de-PBDEs>OH-PBDEs. These results suggest that metabolism occurred preferentially in leaves and stems than in roots. Less transformation and shorter elimination half-life of OH-PBDEs would contribute to the lower concentrations of OH-PBDEs than of de-PBDEs or MeO-PBDEs in maize.
19339036	Concentrations of persistent contaminants often vary widely among individuals within a population. We hypothesized that such variation was caused mainly by differences in diet (biomagnification) and in coastal systems by the tendency of marine systems to act as contaminant sinks. We examined the relationship between contaminant concentrations and stable isotope ratios in nestling plasma from an apex predator with a particularly broad diet. Our study included freshwater, estuarine, inshore and pelagic breeding sites. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at the pelagic marine sites showed high trophic level and marine input, eagles at the freshwater sites showed low trophic level and marine input, and eagles at the estuarine and inshore marine sites had intermediate values. The relationship between trophic level and marine input may reflect longer food chains in pelagic compared to terrestrial ecosystems. summation operator PCBs and DDE concentrations generally increased with trophic level and marine input, with the exception of the freshwater sites, while summation operator PBDEs, hydroxylated-PBDEs and hydroxylated-PCBs increased with marine input, but were independent of trophic level. The relationships for summation operator PCBs and DDE were often slightly stronger with marine input than trophic level, suggesting that oceanographic processes may be more important than trophic level. At freshwater locations, spatial variation may be more important than trophic level due to the heterogeneity of contaminant profiles between feeding locations (lakes, rivers, agricultural fields). Adults had similar isotopic composition to their chicks but higher contamination. Based on nests where prey composition was determined independently, isotopic enrichment values for nestling plasma were 1.6+/-0.1 (delta(15)N) and -0.4+/-0.2 (delta(13)C). We conclude that trophic level and marine influence are significant factors influencing PCB and DDE concentrations in eagles. However, trophic level in particular did not influence PBDEs, possibly due to their being metabolized by eagles.
6305904	Hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidases have been stimulated when cattle were experimentally fed polybrominated biphenyls (PBB; fireMaster BP-6). These changes provide mechanisms for alteration of the metabolism and clearance of steroid hormones that might then affect reproductive function. This study was conducted to examine the effects of PBB on the clearance of radiolabel from injected estradiol-17 beta and progesterone along with daily determinations of concentrations of endogenous estradiol-17 beta and progestins in blood plasma. Toxicity was induced by dosing two Holstein cows with 25 g of fireMaster BP-6/d for 39 or 50 d. Single iv injections of 35 microCi [4-14C] progesterone and 400 microCi [2,4,6,7-3H] estradiol-17 beta were given on d -5, 10, 30 and 38 or 48 relative to dosing. Last injections were given when severe toxic symptoms were observed in each animal. Clinical signs, blood constituents, and necropsy findings confirmed the toxic syndrome. Clearance of 14C from progesterone was described by a biexponential function of time, while 3H from estradiol was cleared more slowly with a triexponential function. The total clearance rate for radiolabel from progesterone was approximately four times greater than estradiol throughout the experiments. The total clearance rates were similar for both steroids before and 10 d after dosing with PBB. A toxic syndrome was well developed by d 30 of PBB dosing and the total clearance rate of both steroids decreased approximately 50% with precipitous decreases when animals were terminally toxic. Despite the developing toxic syndrome, plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta and total progestins were normal and the periodicity of estrous cycles was maintained.
17618686	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as flame retardants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the PBDE serum levels in residents from an electronic waste dismantling region, residents living within 50 km of the dismantling region, and a referent group with no occupational PBDE exposure. Fourteen PBDE congeners including BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, BDE-183, BDE-196, BDE-197, BDE-203, BDE-206, BDE-207, BDE-208 and BDE-209 were quantified in these three groups by gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization (NCI) mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. We found that the levels of all PBDE congeners in serum of residents from electronic waste dismantling region were significantly higher than those in the two other groups. The referents showed the lowest PBDE levels. Concentrations of congeners with a high number of bromine substituents, i.e., hepta- to decaBDEs in occupational exposure workers were 11-20 times higher than those in the referent group. BDE-209 was the dominant congener. The highest concentration of BDE-209 was observed among the electronic waste dismantling workers, and it was 3436 ng g(-1) lipid weight (ng g(-1) l.w.), which is the highest concentration of BDE-209 in humans worldwide. Some higher brominated PBDE congeners such as BDE-197, BDE-207 and BDE-208 also showed elevated concentrations in dismantling workers. This study confirms that BDE-209 is released to the environment and can bioaccumulate in the blood of electronic waste dismantling workers, and extensive occupational exposure to PBDEs leads to elevated concentrations of all PBDE congeners in serum.
18941581	BACKGROUND: Developing infants may be especially sensitive to hormone disruption from chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). OBJECTIVE: We investigated relationships between cord serum levels of PCBs and PBDEs and thyroid hormones measured in cord blood serum and neonatal blood spots. METHODS: We measured PCBs and PBDEs, thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4) and free T4 (FT4) in cord blood serum from 297 infants who were delivered at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 2004-2005. We abstracted results of total T4 (TT4) measured in blood spots collected in the hospital and at neonatal visits. We used delivery mode (augmented vaginal deliveries and nonelective cesarean deliveries) as a surrogate for intrapartum stress, which is known to alter cord blood thyroid hormones. RESULTS: In the full study population, no compounds were associated with a change in average TSH, FT4, or TT4. BDE-100 was associated with increased odds of low cord TT4, BDE-153 with increased odds of low cord TT4 and FT4, and no compounds were associated with increased odds of high TSH. For infants born by spontaneous, vaginal, unassisted deliveries, PCBs were associated with lower cord TT4 and FT4 and lower TT4 measured in neonatal blood spots. PBDEs showed consistent but mainly nonsignificant negative associations with TT4 and FT4 measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal PCB and PBDE exposures were associated with reduced TT4 and FT4 levels among infants born by spontaneous, unassisted vaginal delivery. Intrapartum stress associated with delivery mode may mask hormonal effects of PCBs and PBDEs. 
18522133	Increased exposure to the flame retardants known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) may be expected to occur during the recycling of polyurethane foam containing these chemicals. To date, no studies in the United States have investigated occupational exposure to these flame retardants during recycling processes. The objective of the present study was to determine if individuals working in foam recycling facilities, and/or carpet installers who may install carpet padding manufactured from recycled foam, possess significantly higher PBDE serum levels relative to that of the general U.S. population. As a control group, serum was collected from four spouses and one clerical worker. In addition, levels in workers were also compared to the recently published national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) data set on PBDEs in the general U.S. population. Serum samples were collected in duplicate and analyzed by two different laboratories as quality control. Total PBDE levels were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the individuals recycling foam and installing carpet (n = 15) relative to the control group (n = 5). Median sigmaPBDE levels in the foam recyclers, carpet layers, and control group were 160, 178, and 19 ng/g lipid, respectively. In contrast, concentrations of a polybrominated biphenyl (BB-153) and a polychlorinated biphenyl (CB-153) were equivalent among all groups tested. The PBDE congeners BDE-47, 99, 100, and 153 contributed 90% of the sigmaPBDE concentration in serum and no differences in congener patterns were apparent among the different groups. Relative to concentrations measured in the NHANES, foam recyclers and carpet layers have body burdens that are an order of magnitude higher. These data suggest individuals recycling foam-containing products, and/ or using products manufactured from recycled foam (i.e., carpet padding), have higher body burdens of PBDEs, and thus may be at higher risk from adverse health effects associated with brominated flame retardant exposure.
23500394	Three brominated flame retardants (BFRs), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were measured in 103 human milk samples collected from Beijing in 2011. The donors' personal information, such as dietary habit and socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, was obtained by questionnaires. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis indicated that the levels of TBBPA ranged from <LOD to 12.46 ng g(-1) lipid weight (lw), with a median value of 0.10 ng g(-1) lw. Three HBCD diastereoisomers (α-, β- and γ-HBCD) were also measured using UPLC-MS/MS. The levels of ΣHBCDs ranged from <LOD to 78.28 ng g(-1) lw, with a median value of 2.40 ng g(-1) lw. α-HBCD was generally the most abundant of the three isomers. Eight PBDE congeners, BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209, were measured using gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The concentrations of ΣPBDEs ranged from 0.22 to 135.41 ng g(-1) lw, with a median value of 3.24 ng g(-1) lw. BDE-209 dominated the PBDE profile in the majority of the human milk samples. The mean estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of TBBPA, ΣHBCDs and ΣPBDEs by breast-fed infants were 2.34, 24.89 and 71.27 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1), respectively. No significant correlation was found between the BFR levels in milk and the mother's diet, place of residence, smoking habit, nursing duration or computer use habit. In contrast, the mother's age, body mass index (BMI), education level and number of computers in the home were related to the levels of some types of BFRs. More research is needed to further investigate the major source(s) of exposure, the effect of each potential factor and the possible toxicological impact of high daily BFR intake on infants.
22578177	In this work, we investigated exposure levels, distribution patterns, and potential harmful impacts of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) on thyroid hormone activity in 26 children with congenital hypothyroidism and their mothers' pair and 12 normal control pairs. The average concentration of PBDEs in congenital hypothyroidism (median: 22.16 ng/g lipid) was higher than in normal controls (median: 14.76 ng/g lipid), but there was no statistical difference between the two groups. The BDE congeners were dominated by penta- to hepta-BDEs, but the greater brominated congeners (e.g., BDE 197, 196, 207, and 208) were relatively abundant in congenital hypothyroidism. BDE 138 was only observed in the congenital hypothyroidism cases. The maternal transfer and transport ratio of individual BDE congeners was shown for BDE 28 (0.588, p < 0.001), BDE 47 (0.564, p < 0.001), BDE 49 (0.712, p < 0.001) and BDE 119 (0.477, p = 0.002). The thyroid hormones were most obviously influenced by the internal exposure to PBDEs in normal mothers, showing a positive relationship with TSH (0.641 with BDE 154; 0.591 with BDE 153) and FT4 (0.584 with BDE 49; 0.572 with BDE 66) and a negative relationship with T3 (-0.577 with BDE 154) in the normal infants group. No significant correlations were observed in the congenital hypothyroidism cases.
21348481	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been widely used as flame retardants in textiles, polyurethane foams, and plastics. PBDEs exert toxic effects in various organisms, including humans, and are ubiquitous in the outdoor and indoor environment. Here we estimate total daily PBDE doses received by consumers in North America and Europe, along with the most important pathways and congeners, and derive PBDE elimination half-lives for chronic exposure. We estimate distributions for all parameters (PBDE concentrations in exposure media, food consumption rates, etc.) and conduct a probabilistic exposure assessment. We find that Americans are exposed the most, likely due to stricter fire regulations, followed by consumers from the UK and Continental Europe. In the central quantiles of the exposure distributions derived, food is the dominant pathway; in the upper quantiles either food or oral and dermal exposure to dust. This reflects the lipophilic and persistent nature of PBDEs and their use in products for indoor-use. Median elimination half-lives are in a range of 1-3 years except for BDE-153 with about seven years and BDE-209 with 4-7 days.
21174975	Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209) is the primary component in a commonly used flame retardant. Previous studies had proved that BDE209 itself was not toxic, while its metabolites including debrominated diphenyl ethers (De-BDEs) and methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs) posed a potential threat to organisms. Many studies had indicated that BDE209 could metabolize quickly in mammals, but lacking in the basic data about the metabolism of BDE209 in fish. In the present study, two replicate treatment groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to BDE209 via a single intraperitoneal injection approximately 100 and 500 ng/g, respectively. Muscle, liver and blood samples were collected to analyze the specific metabolites on day 1 and day 28 post injection. The highest concentration of BDE209 was detected in muscle tissues, from 796.1 ng/g wet weight (day 1) to 687.1 ng/g wet weight (day 28) in high dose group, suggesting that BDE209 could accumulate slightly in muscle tissues. However, BDE209 was not detected in the blood for all treatments. Most congeners of De-BDEs were found in muscle and liver tissues, with the highest concentration in the liver. The main De-BDEs were nona-, octa-, hepta- and penta-De-BDEs. A total of seven MeO-BDE metabolites were observed among different fish tissues. Blood had the highest contribution of the MeO-BDE metabolites. Each MeO-BDE congener increased over the 28 days. These results in contrast to other studies suggested possible species-specific differences in metabolic abilities.
18087602	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported blood levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the U.S. population. Information about neonatal levels and about the relationship to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposures is limited. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to characterize levels and determinants of fetal exposure to PBDEs and PCBs among newborns from Baltimore, Maryland. METHODS: We analyzed umbilical cord blood for eight PBDEs and 35 PCBs from infants delivered at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Maternal and infant characteristics were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of cord serum samples had quantifiable levels of at least one PBDE congener, and > 99% had at least one detectable PCB congener. PBDE concentrations in cord blood were similar to those reported in other studies from North America. Strong correlations were observed within but not across PCB and PBDE classes. Multivariate models showed that many factors independently predicted exposure to BDE-47, BDE-100, and BDE-153 and CB-118, CB-138/158, CB-153, and CB-180. Generally, infants of Asian mothers had lower PBDE and PCB levels, and infants of smokers had higher levels. Increased maternal body mass index was associated with lower levels of PCBs but not PBDEs. Levels of PCBs but not PBDEs were lower in births from married and multiparous mothers. Increased maternal age was associated with higher PCB levels but lower PBDE levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although many of the factors we investigated were independent predictors of both PBDE and PCB levels, in some cases the direction of associations was different. More research is needed to better understand the sources and pathways of PBDE exposure. 
16949631	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were measured in samples of human blood serum taken from 23 donors in Wellington, New Zealand. Concentrations expressed as the sum of congeners 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183 (SigmaPBDE) were - at an average of 7.17 ng SigmaPBDE g (lipid)(-1) - within the range reported for human tissues in Europe, but lower than in Australia and North America. The most likely source of this contamination is considered to be the release of PBDEs from imported consumer goods. The congener pattern observed is in line with that reported for human tissues outside North America, but shows a lower contribution of PBDE 47 to SigmaPBDE than observed in North Americans. No significant (p>0.1) differences between concentrations in males and females were detected, and no relationship between donor age and SigmaPBDE concentration was observed. One donor displayed concentrations that were significantly elevated (i.e. > average +2 standard deviations) above those in others in this study.
21793581	We measured levels of 10 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in serum collected during pregnancy and at delivery from 416 pregnant, predominantly immigrant, women living in Monterey County, CA. The most frequently detected congeners were BDE-47, -99, -100, and -153, all components of the penta mixture, detected in >97% of samples. We used multivariable regression models to examine factors associated with exposure to individual PBDE congeners as well as their total summed concentration (ng/g lipid). Prenatal and delivery total PBDE levels were correlated between sampling times (n = 21; Pearson r = 0.99, p < 0.001). In multivariable models, total PBDE levels increased significantly with time residing in the U.S. (p < 0.001) and among women with ≥3 pieces of stuffed furniture in their homes (p < 0.05). Women's total PBDE levels increased 4.0% (95% CI = 2.8, 5.3) for each additional year residing in the U.S., after adjustment for prepregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, and SES. Having ≥3 pieces of stuffed furniture in the home was associated with a 26.8% (95% CI = 2.0, 57.5) increase in women's serum PBDE levels. Findings suggest PBDE indoor contamination in California homes is contributing to human exposures in a population of recent immigrants.
16203180	A simple, rapid, sensitive and reproducible method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and acidified silica clean-up was developed for the measurement of 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), including BDE 209, and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB 153) in human serum. Several solid-phase sorbents (Empore C(18), Isolute Phenyl, Isolute ENV+ and OASIS HLB) were tested and it was found that OASIStrade mark HLB (500 mg) gives the highest absolute recoveries (between 64% and 95%, R.S.D.<17%, n=3) for all tested analytes and internal standards. Removal of co-extracted biogenic materials was performed using a 6 ml disposable cartridge containing (from bottom to top) silica impregnated with sulphuric acid, activated silica and anhydrous sodium sulphate. PBDEs and BB 153 were quantified using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS) operated in electron-capture negative ionization mode. The method limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 0.2 and 25 pg/ml serum (0.1 and 4 ng/g lipid weight). LOQs were dependent on the analyte levels in procedural blanks which resulted in the highest LOQs for PBDE congeners found in higher concentrations in blanks (e.g. BDE 47, 99 and 209). The use of OASIS HLB SPE cartridge allowed a good method repeatability (within- and between-day precision<12% for all congeners, except for BDE 209<17%, n=3). The method was applied to serum samples from a random Belgian population. The obtained results were within the range of PBDE levels in other non-exposed population from Europe.
18599107	As part of a longitudinal cohort study, now in its second decade, we determined PCDDs/Fs dl-PCBs and PBDEs in serum of adolescents with known perinatal PCDD/F exposure. Of the original cohort, 33 adolescents aged 14-19 years, who had been studied previously during their neonatal (n=60), toddler and pre-pubertal period (n=41) agreed to participate in the current follow-up. PCDD/F-, dl-PCB- and PBDE congeners were measured using GC/MS. Current serum levels of PCDD/Fs determined in our cohort were relatively low (mean of 2.2 pg/g) compared to the perinatal exposure. No correlation between perinatal exposure and current serum PCDD/F was found. Planar PCB TEQ levels were 2.2 pg/g. Current summation operatorPBDE levels were 8.7 ng/g lipid. There was one outlier with a summation operatorPBDE of 74 ng/g lipid. The presence of this high value indicates that the exposure pathway is different from PCDD/F and PCB, most likely by dust and food contaminated with dust. Concluding we can say that current PCDD/F levels are quite low compared to the perinatal PCDD/F exposure of the cohort. PBDE levels however are relatively high compared to other European countries, more research on possible health effects of these levels, especially for subjects with outlier concentrations, should be performed.
17874768	In P.R. China, electronic waste (e-waste) from across the world is dismantled and discarded. Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in serum from residents of an e-waste dismantling region (Guiyu, South China), where 80% of families work in e-waste recycling, and compared to a matching cohort from a nearby region where the fishing industry dominates (Haojiang). Serum concentrations of PBDEs and OCPs, but not PCBs, were significantly different in the two regions: the median sigmaPBDE concentration was 3 times higher in Guiyu than Haojiang, whereas the opposite was true for dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). PBDEs typically accounted for 46% of the total organohalogen chemicals in samples from Guiyu, but 8.7% in Haojiang. The median BDE-209 concentration in Guiyu was 50-200 times higher than previously reported in occupationally exposed populations. The highest BDE-209 concentration was 3100 ng/g lipid, the highest yet reported in humans. Serum PBDE concentrations did not correlate with PCBs or OCPs, whereas PCBs and OCPs showed positive correlations, suggesting that sources of PBDEs to humans are different from PCBs and OCPs. The levels of PBDEs in individuals from Haojiang are possibly related to the recycling activity at Guiyu, through atmospheric transport.
15053652	A semiautomated extraction and cleanup method has been developed for the measurement of eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153). The method employs automated addition of internal standards ((13)C-labeled), addition of formic acid (denaturation agent), and dilution with water prior to automated overnight extraction using a modular solid-phase extraction (SPE) system. Removal of coextracted biogenic materials was performed on a two-layered 3-mL disposable cartridge containing activated silica gel and a mixture of silica gel and sulfuric acid. Sample cleanup was automated using the same modular SPE system. Reproducibility and precision of the liquid handler used for internal standard additions were shown to be 2 and 4%, respectively. Overall reproducibility during processing of eight batches of samples (N = 30/batch, including methods blanks) was below 10% for most analytes. Mean recoveries of the (13)C-labeled internal standards ranged from 69 to 95% for the seven monitored PBDEs; 76 and 98% were recovered for BB-153 and CB-153, respectively.
17482428	After several decades of commercial use, the flame retardant chemicals polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their metabolites have become pervasive environmental contaminants with a global distribution. PBDEs have entered the food chain and increasing levels can be detected in the human body. Decabrominated diphenyl ether (decaBDE) is currently the most widely used of the PBDEs in the United States. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the health effects of decaBDE. The current study examined the effects of neonatal exposure to decaBDE in the inbred C57BL6/J mouse. Neonatal male and female mice were exposed to a daily oral dose of 0, 6, or 20 mg/kg decaBDE from postnatal day 2 to 15. Three groups of endpoints were examined: the ontogeny of sensorimotor responses and serum thyroxine levels in immature animals, and locomotor activity in adult animals. In immature animals, 20 mg/kg/day produced developmental delays in the acquisition of the palpebral reflex. At this age, exposed males also showed a dose-related reduction of serum thyroxine levels. As adults, decaBDE exposure altered the normal sex- and age-specific characteristics of spontaneous locomotor activity. The most striking effect was an increase of activity during the first 1.5 h of the 2 h assessment in males exposed to 20 mg/kg/day decaBDE. These effects suggest that decaBDE is a developmental neurotoxicant that can produce long-term behavioral changes following a discrete period of neonatal exposure.
21270998	Due to their lipophilic properties, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are commonly assessed using the blubber of marine mammals. However, these chemicals are also accumulating in other tissues including the liver. Some pollutants, namely perfluorinated alkyl acids, are found predominately in the liver and blood of marine mammals, and thus monitored in those tissues. This raises the question whether any tissue would represent an identical trend of POPs in the SLE beluga. The current study reports the first temporal trends of PBDEs and PCBs in the liver of 65 SLE belugas. Neither ∑₇PBDEs nor major individual PBDE-homolog group concentrations showed significant trends between 1993 and 2007. Also, ∑₃₂PCBs did not change over years, although, tetra-, penta- and hepta-PCB decreased by 7.1, 6.8 and 8.5%, respectively, in males, whereas tetra-, penta- and octa-PCBs declined by 11, 12 and 12.9%, respectively, in females. In order to compare the distribution of POPs between liver and blubber, a lipid normalised concentration ratio R (blubber/liver) for PBDEs and PCBs was calculated for each individual beluga. For all PBDE and several PCB homolog groups, mean R values were not statistically different from unity indicating that the partitioning of these POPs is governed by the tissue lipid-content. Temporal trends of R ratios of PBDEs and PCBs were also examined. There were generally no significant temporal trends except for PBDEs in males where R increased in average by 12.7 ± 2.9% yearly. The stratification of the blubber into a metabolically active (inner) and less active layers (outer blubber) may result in a slower response time of the blubber (full depth) than the liver to the recent change of contamination in the environment and explain the time trend differences between both tissues. This study suggests that the liver is more representative of recent exposure to lipophilic contaminants.
15589248	Analysis of blood samples is an effective way of evaluating contamination by persistent pollutants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin/furans (PCDD/Fs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human population. Concentrations of PBDEs, PCDD/Fs and PCBs were measured in the blood of laborers (n = 13) working full time in two different municipal waste incinerator (MWI) plants and residents from the general population (n = 22) living in areas near MWIs in Korea. The concentrations of PBDEs were found to be slightly higher in the blood of incineration workers (8.61-46.05 ng/g lipid; mean, 19.33 ng/g lipid; median, 15.94 ng/g lipid) in comparison to that of residents from the general population (7.24-28.89 ng/g lipid; mean, 15.06 ng/g lipid; median, 14.34 ng/g lipid). The total average PCDD/Fs and PCB TEQ concentration was 20.11 pg/g lipid, averaged over incineration workers (17.73 pg/g lipid) and the general population (21.52 pg/g lipid). In addition, the average total crude concentration of PCDD/Fs was 7.40 ng/g lipids, which was 4.1 times greater than for PBDEs. Congener specific analysis confirmed that BDE 47 was a predictive indicator for total PBDE concentration (correlation coefficient r = 0.912), and that PCB 153 was a predictive indicator for total PCB concentration (r = 0.967). The PBDE levels in human blood in Korea are much higher than those reported in other countries. The presence of the BDE 183 congener was characteristic in the blood of workers from an electronic dismantling facility in MWIs.
16882522	Blood and/or breast milk have been used to assess human exposure to various environmental contaminants. Few studies have been available to compare the concentrations in one matrix with those in another. The goals of this study were to determine the current levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Japanese women, with analysis of the effects of lifestyle and dietary habits on these levels, and to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) with which to predict the ratio of serum concentration to breast milk concentration. We measured PBDEs and PCBs in 89 paired samples of serum and breast milk collected in four regions of Japan in 2005. The geometric means of the total concentrations of PBDE (13 congeners) in milk and serum were 1.56 and 2.89 ng/g lipid, respectively, whereas those of total PCBs (15 congeners) were 63.9 and 37.5 ng/g lipid, respectively. The major determinant of total PBDE concentration in serum and milk was the geographic area within Japan, whereas nursing duration was the major determinant of PCB concentration. BDE-209 was the most predominant PBDE congener in serum but not in milk. The excretion of BDE 209 in milk was lower than that of BDE 47 and BDE 153. QSAR analysis revealed that two parameters, calculated octanol/water partition and number of hydrogen-bond acceptors, were significant descriptors. During the first weeks of lactation, the predicted partitioning of PBDE and PCB congeners from serum to milk agreed with the observed values. However, the prediction became weaker after 10 weeks of nursing.
20504038	A new method has been developed for the determination of selected polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) in four polymers: high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS), and polypropylene (PP). PBDEs and PBB in the polymers were extracted with toluene, using ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE). The extracts were then determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS), using external calibration (single-point). Extraction parameters of UAE and several ICP-MS parameters were optimized. Extraction efficiencies almost reached 100%. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 0.7%-5.4%. The results demonstrate that the method possesses advantages of good precision, as well as high extraction efficiency and accuracy. The method especially overcomes the problem of the thermal degradation of highly brominated PBDEs, such as PBDE-209.
23075377	Bromophenol glucuronide and sulfate conjugates have been reported to be products of mammalian metabolism of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of additive flame-retardants found ubiquitously in the environment. In order to explore their occurrence in human urine, four water-soluble bromophenol conjugates, namely, 2,4-dibromophenyl glucuronide, 2,4,6-tribromophenyl glucuronide, 2,4-dibromophenyl sulfate, and 2,4,6-tribromophenyl sulfate, were synthesized, purified, and characterized. An analytical protocol using solid-phase extraction and ion-paired liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) quantification has been developed for the direct and simultaneous determination of these glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in human urine samples. The limit of detections for all analytes were below 13 pg mL(-1), with 73-101% analyte recovery and 7.2-8.6% repeatability. The method was applied to analyze 20 human urine samples collected randomly from voluntary donors in Hong Kong SAR, China. All the samples were found to contain one or more of the bromophenol conjugates, with concentration ranging from 0.13-2.45 μg g(-1) creatinine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical protocol for the direct and simultaneous monitoring of these potential phase II metabolites of PBDEs in human urine. Our results have also suggested the potential of these bromophenol conjugates in human urine to be convenient molecular markers for the quantification of population exposure to PBDEs.
17257644	In experimental models, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of brominated flame retardants, have caused effects in a number of biological end-points, including neurobehavioural effects, disturbances in thyroid and steroid hormone homeostasis, and other steroid-related effects. Almost exclusively, only external dose metrics (dose per body weight basis) have been studied in connection to the observed effects. In this study we report on new analyses of plasma PBDE levels in surplus samples from earlier studies on thyroid hormones (TH) in exposed rodents. Female, 7-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were given either Bromkal 70-5 DE (Study I; 18 or 36 mg/kg bw/day) or BDE-47 (Study II; 1, 6 or 18 mg/kg bw/day) daily by gavage for two weeks. At an external dose of 18 mg/kg bw/day significant TH effects (decreased plasma free thyroxin levels) were observed in both studies, corresponding to an internal (plasma) dose of 463 microg sumPBDE/g lipid (Study I) or 421 microg BDE-47/g lipid (Study II). If we compare the contribution of different BDE congeners to the total BDE level in rat plasma after Bromkal exposure (Study II), and in the Bromkal mixture itself, the most important congener in the Bromkal mixture were also found in plasma. However, the relative concentration of BDE-99 was lower, and that of BDE-153 was higher, than that of the mixture, indicating selectivity in uptake, metabolism and/or excretion of the individual BDE congeners. Explicitly, the possible in vivo conversion of BDE-99 to BDE-47, and of BDE-154 to BDE-153 could not be excluded. The internal dose in the present rat study could be compared to reported human serum doses of PBDE. Human serum/blood levels have a wide range, from 3 to 6 ng sumPBDE/g lipid in background samples from Europe, about 10 times higher in US sample, and up to 100 times higher (300-600 ng/g lipid) in upper-end levels in collected samples from USA. As a consequence, the margin between effects levels in the rat and exposure levels in man varies widely, with a quotient roughly from 1000 to 100,000. Generally, it could be expected that this margin is lower than if external dose metrics would be used. An even lower margin could be expected as recent studies have shown effects in offspring at lower doses than those giving effects in our studies. Lastly, it should be noted that humans are already exposed to a mixture of chemicals in daily life, a fact that complicates this kind of comparison.
18501952	Seven polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were measured in the particulate fraction (<2mm) of household dust samples (n=40), collected in four different countries (Australia, Germany, Great Britain, and United States). Dust samples from Germany contained the lowest concentrations of total PBDEs (median: 74 ng/g, range: 17-550 ng/g dust). Australian dust contained the second lowest concentration (median: 1200 ng/g, range: 500-13,000 ng/g dust). The dust from the United States and Great Britain contained the highest measured amounts of total PBDEs (US median: 4200 ng/g dust, range: 520-29,000 ng/g; Great Britain median: 10,000 ng/g, range: 950-54,000 ng/g). Daily intake of PBDEs has been estimated from published reference values on daily dust intake rates. The highest daily intake of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) found was in the United States (<1-330 ng/day) and the lowest was in Germany (<1-2 ng/day). The PBDE congeners present in commercially available pentabromodiphenyl ether were the highest in concentration in the United States, and the congener distribution was similar to that of the technical preparation (i.e., 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether [BDE-99] was similar in concentration to that of BDE-47). We conclude that further studies are required to investigate human indoor exposure to PBDEs across countries and to determine the risk factors related to indoor design factors.
19111055	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants applied as coatings to many consumer products, including household items. PBDEs are released and produce airborne vapors and dusts. Inhalation of particle-phase and/or gas-phase PBDEs is therefore a major route of exposure. In an attempt to mimic realistic airborne exposures, actual uptake, and deposition of particles and vapors, we prepared and characterized particles for future animal exposure studies. To trace the particles in environmental and biological systems, we employed fluoro tagging. We synthesized, characterized, and employed three PBDE congeners, 35, 47, and 99, and five fluoro-substituted PBDEs (F-PBDEs), 17-F5' 25-F5', 28-F3', 35-F5', 47-F3, and 99-F3', for this study. The PBDE congeners were selected because they are commonly found in house dust. For that reason, we coated spherical silica particles of 3 microm and C18 endcapped silica as representative and inert support materials, with 20, 30, and 40% PBDEs. We determined the particle size distributions by aerodynamic particle size spectrometry and the morphology by scanning electron microscopy. The suitability of the fluoro-tagged tracers to mimic their corresponding parent PBDEs was investigated by extraction studies from spiked blood serum. Our study is of fundamental importance to the development of xenobiotic tracers for monitoring routes of human exposure to PBDEs and understanding uptake of PBDEs from particles and vapors.
22760441	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are flame retardants that were previously used in upholstery, fabrics, and household appliances. PBDEs have been linked to adverse health outcomes, including neurotoxicity, thyroid hormone dysregulation, endocrine disruption, and poor semen quality. Because PBDEs pass into placental circulation, maternal exposures can approximate fetal exposures. Our objectives were to determine whether diet and specific human behaviors were significantly associated with PBDE exposures in a cohort of pregnant women. Women between the 34th and 38th week of pregnancy were given a questionnaire about behavioral, environmental, and dietary factors and asked to provide blood samples. Serum PBDE levels were measured using GS-MS and lipid adjusted. An adjusted ordinary least squares regression model was run to identify potential associations between behaviors and serum PBDE levels. Serum concentrations of BDEs 47, 99, 100, and 153 were found above the limit of detection in at least 50% of study participants and used in our models. Associations with serum PBDEs were observed with self-reported hand-to-mouth behaviors, including biting nails and licking fingers. Serum BDE levels of 47, 99, 153, and total PBDEs were also significantly higher in those individuals owning a large-screen TV compared with those who did not. Serum PBDE levels were comparable to levels reported in the general population. Hand-to-mouth behaviors may influence serum PBDE concentrations in adults. Household electronics such as large-screen TVs appear to serve as a significant source of PBDEs in pregnant women. Together, hand-to-mouth behaviors and TV ownership may serve as a route of exposure to PBDEs in adults.
14998004	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used as flame retardants in many types of consumer products. Perhaps as a result of their widespread use and their lipophilicity, these compounds have become ubiquitous in the environment and in people. This review summarizes PBDE concentrations measured in several environmental media and analyzes these data in terms of relative concentrations, concentration trends, and congener profiles. In human blood, milk, and tissues, total PBDE levels have increased exponentially by a factor of approximately 100 during the last 30 yr; this is a doubling time of approximately 5 yr. The current PBDE concentrations in people from Europe are approximately 2 ng/g lipid, but the concentrations in people from the United States are much higher at approximately 35 ng/g lipid. Current PBDE concentrations in marine mammals from the Canadian Arctic are very low at approximately 5 ng/g lipid, but they have increased exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 7 yr. Marine mammals from the rest of the world have current PBDE levels of approximately 1000 ng/g lipid, and these concentrations have also increased exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 5 yr. Some birds' eggs from Sweden are also highly contaminated (at approximately 2000 ng/g lipid) and show PBDE doubling times of approximately 6 yr. Herring gull eggs from the Great Lakes region now have PBDE concentrations of approximately 7000 ng/g lipid, and these levels have doubled every approximately 3 yr. Fish from Europe have approximately 10 times lower PBDE concentrations than fish from North America. From these and other data, it is clear that the environment and people from North America are very much more contaminated with PBDEs as compared to Europe and that these PBDE levels have doubled every 4-6 yr. Analyses of the relative distributions of the most abundant PBDE congeners (using category averages and principal component analysis) indicated that these patterns cannot yet be used to assign sources to these pollutants.
19921894	We developed a selective competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to monitor environmental and human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether BDE-47 that is used as a flame retardant 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a dominant PBDE congener of toxicological concern, was the target analyte. To achieve effective hapten presentation on the carrier protein for antibody production, immunizing haptens with a rigid double-bonded hydrocarbon linker introduced at different positions on the target molecule were synthesized as well as coating haptens that mimic a characteristic fragment of the molecule. Rabbit antisera produced against each immunizing antigen were screened against competitive hapten coating antigens. Underoptimized competitive indirect ELISA conditions, the linear detection range in the assay buffer that includes 50% dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.35-8.50 microg/L with an IC50 value of 1.75 microg/L for BDE-47. Little or no crossreactivity (<6%) was observed to related PBDE congeners containing the BDE-47 moiety and other halogenated compounds. Using a magnetic particle-based competitive direct ELISA increased the sensitivity by 10-fold over the indirect ELISA. The ELISA provided quantitative results when performed on small volume/weight samples such as dust furniture foam, and blood/ serum following sample preparation, suggesting a convenient screening tool.
17023223	An analytical method comprised of automated solid-phase extraction and determination using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (single quadrupole) has been developed for the determination of 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 26 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), two organochlorine compounds (OCs) (hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene) and two brominated phenols (pentabromophenol, and tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A)). The analytes were extracted using a sorbent of polystyrene-divinylbenzene and an additional clean-up was performed on a sulphuric acid-silica column to remove lipids. The method has been validated by spiking horse serum at five levels. The mean accuracy given as recovery relative to internal standards was 95%, 99%, 93% and 109% for the PBDEs PCBs, OCs and brominated phenols, respectively. The mean repeatability given as RSDs was respectively 6.9%, 8.7%, 7.5% and 15%. Estimated limits of detection (S/N=3) were in the range 0.2-1.8 pg/g serum for the PBDEs and phenols, and from 0.1 pg/g to 56 pg/g serum for the PCBs and OCs. The validated method has been used to investigate the levels of PBDEs and PCBs in 21 pooled serum samples from the general Norwegian population. In serum from men (age 40-50 years) the sum of seven PBDE congeners (IUPAC No. 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183) increased from 1977 (0.5 ng/g lipids) to 1998 (4.8 ng/g lipids). From 1999 to 2003 the concentration of PBDEs seems to have stabilised. On the other hand, the sum of five PCBs (IUPAC No. 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) in these samples decreased steadily from 1977 (666 ng/g lipids) to 2003 (176 ng/g lipids). Tetrabromobisphenol-A and BDE-209 were detected in almost all samples, but no similar temporal trends to that seen for the PBDEs were observed for these compounds, which might be due to the short half-lives of these brominated flame retardants (FR) in humans.
22814209	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been widely used as flame retardants and are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. PBDEs have been linked to adverse neurodevelopment in animals and humans. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between breast milk PBDE levels and social and emotional development in toddlers. METHODS: The Pregnancy Infection and Nutrition (PIN) and PIN Babies studies followed a cohort of North Carolina pregnant women and their children through 36 months of age. Breast milk samples obtained at 3 months postpartum were analyzed for PBDEs. The Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) was completed by mothers when children were approximately 30 months of age (n = 222). We assessed the relationship between breast milk concentrations of five PBDE congeners-BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, and 153-and children's social and emotional development, adjusting for other factors. RESULTS: A small, imprecise, yet consistent positive association was apparent between BDEs 47, 99, and 100 and increased externalizing behaviors, specifically activity/impulsivity behaviors. Externalizing domain T-scores ranged from 30 to 87 with a mean of 47.8. Compared with those with BDE-47 concentrations below the median, adjusted externalizing behavior domain scores were 1.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.2, 4.4] and 2.8 (95% CI -0.1, 5.7) points higher for children born to women with breast milk concentrations in the 3rd and 4th quartiles, respectively. PBDEs were not associated with other social and emotional developmental domains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, although imprecise, suggest a subtle association between early-life PBDE exposure and increased activity/impulsivity behaviors in early childhood. Confirmation of these results is needed in other longitudinal studies. 
20077203	This study examined the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) in the umbilical cord blood of infants, and investigated the relationship between PBDE concentration and thyroid hormone levels. The concentration of PBDE were measured in the cord blood samples of 108 infants collected in Cheil Woman's Hospital, Seoul, Korea, in 2007. Of 108 pregnant woman reported, the average age was 31.9 +/- 3.54 yr (range 20-42 yr). The mean body weight of the infants was 3.15 +/- 0.57 kg (1.89-4.43 kg), and no birth defects were documented. The concentrations of the total PBDEs (7 congeners) found in the umbilical cord blood averaged 8.377 +/- 6.381 ng/g lipid, ranging from not determined (ND) to 29.407 ng/g lipid. Of the seven congeners detected, BDE-47 (4.571 +/- 2.903 ng/g lipid) accounted for the majority (38% of total PBDE) of total PBDE, followed in descending order by BDE-153 (3.080 +/- 2.231 ng/g lipid) and BDE-183 (2.933 +/- 2.386). There was no apparent correlation between the serum PBDE levels and thyroid hormone concentrations. Similarly, there was no apparent relationship between the infant thyroxine (T4) levels and four prevalent PBDE congener concentrations. Data suggest that the concentration of PBDE in umbilical cord blood of Korean infants is similar to or lower than concentrations reported from North America. In addition, PBDE readily crossed the blood placenta barrier. Therefore, further study on the relationship between the maternal and fetal blood concentrations of PBDE is recommended for a more comprehensive exposure assessment of PBDE in Koreans.
18958450	An increasing number of studies use blood obtained noninvasively to monitor organohalogen contaminants; however, blood can be difficult to analyze because of its aqueous nature and high protein content. We compared five methods for extracting polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organochlorine pesticides, and lipids from serum using National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in Human Serum. Liquid:liquid (LLE), cavity-dispersed microwave-assisted (MAE), focused microwave-assisted (FME), solid-phase (SPE), and pressurized fluid (PFE) extraction techniques were compared. FME extraction yielded the optimal recovery of internal standards (IS). All methods resulted in similar contaminant concentrations that also agreed with the certified values for SRM 1589a, except for only a few compounds measured by methods other than FME. Based on these findings, the FME method was determined to be the best overall extraction method. One procedural factor was found to affect contaminant concentrations; use of IS carrier solvents that were immiscible with serum (or when the serum was not directly physically mixed with IS) resulted in a 30% underestimation of organohalogen concentrations. This study offers valid, novel extraction alternatives beyond traditional methods (e.g., LLE) for blood contaminant measurements.
3030994	Bovine serum isocitrate dehydrogenase (sICDH) was investigated in dairy cattle as a clinical measurement indicative of hepatic injury. Conditions for optimization of isocitrate dehydrogenase assays for bovine serum are described. Assays of sICDH in normal cattle show average activities of .814 (SD = .202) units/ml serum with a range of .316 to 1.268 for 83 samples taken from 32 animals. Investigation of sICDH in pregnant dairy cattle experimentally dosed with polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) showed no discernible elevations until doses were sufficient to cause toxicosis (25,000 mg PBB/d). Cows lethally dosed with 25,000 mg PBB/d had moderate elevations of sICDH (approximately a twofold increase) concomitant with severe toxicosis in some but not all animals. This PBB dose also caused abortion or fetal death in pregnant animals; elevation of sICDH in these animals was coincident with fetal trauma. This suggests that sICDH may be influenced by fetoplacental contributions in pregnant animals. Non-pregnant cows, intoxicated with PBB, had minimal sICDH elevation as compared with 10-fold in a calf with experimentally induced hepatotoxicity (thioacetamide). This observation was consistent with histopathological findings of minimal, if any, hepatic involvement in dairy cattle lethally intoxicated with PBB. Serum isocitrate dehydrogenase appears to be a useful adjunct to the ordinary complement of serum chemistries used for clinical diagnosis; however, it does not appear to reflect exclusively hepatic injury.
18351120	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153) are chemicals known as brominated flame retardants. We have assessed the exposure status of the United States population to PBDEs and BB-153 and explored associations with demographic information, including participants' age, sex, and race/ethnicity. A total of 2,062 serum samples, from participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 aged 12 years and older, were analyzed for PBDEs and BB-153; stratified and regression analyses were used to examine levels among demographic groups. The congener with the highest serum concentration was 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) [geometric mean 20.5 ng/g lipid]; followed by 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaBDE (BDE-153) [5.7 ng/g lipid]; 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE-99) [5.0 ng/g lipid; a value equal to the highest limit of detection for an individual sample]; 2,2',4,4',6-pentaBDE (BDE-100) [3.9 ng/g lipid]; BB-153 [2.3 ng/g lipid]; and 2,4,4'-triBDE (BDE-28) [1.2 ng/g lipid]. For BDE-47, we observed no significant difference in the least-squares geometric mean (LSGM) by sex, but with age we found both a linear decrease (p = 0.01) and a positive quadratic trend (p = 0.01). Its LSGM, 27.9 ng/lipid, in the 12-19 year olds decreased to 17.2 ng/g lipid in the 40-49 year group, and then curved upward to 20.4 ng/g lipid in the > or =60 years olds. Mexican Americans had the highest LSGM of BDE-47 (24.5 ng/g lipid), which was significantly higher than that of non-Hispanic whites (19.7 ng/g lipid, p = 0.01). Adults 60 years and older were twice as likely as adults 20-59 years old to have a serum BDE-47 concentration above the 95th percentile (p = 0.02). These data provide needed exposure assessment data for public health decisions.
16082965	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants due to their use as flame retardants. Similarly to PCBs, the PBDEs are metabolized to hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs) in mammals. In the present study equimolar doses of seven environmentally relevant PBDE congeners were given intraperitoneally as a mixture to rats, and their blood plasma was analyzed for parent compounds and hydroxylated metabolites 1 and 5 days after dosing. Sixteen OH-PBDEs and two diOH-PBDEs were detected as PBDE metabolites in the rat plasma, a novel finding. Four OH-tetraBDEs were structurally identified by comparison (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) with authentic reference standards. The position of the hydroxyl groups was suggested according to the mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns of the corresponding PBDE methyl ether derivatives. The OH-PBDE metabolites were dominated by hydroxyl groups in the meta- and parapositions. The results show that OH-PBDE congeners have an ability to be retained in rat blood, most likely by a mechanism similar to that of OH-PCBs. The results will be useful for determination of the origin of OH-PBDEs present in wildlife and in humans, since OH-PBDEs are also common natural products in marine environments.
16124294	Novel classes and congeners of contaminant residues that are structurally analogous to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants were assessed in the plasma of seven benthic- and six pelagic-feeding fish species from the highly contaminated Detroit River corridor, namely, hydroxylated-PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), methoxylated-PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs), and the antimicrobial OH-trichlorodiphenyl ether, triclosan, and its methylated (MeO) triclosan analogue. In all samples sigmaPBDE concentrations were comprised mainly of BDE47, BDE99, and BDE100 (>85%) and ranged from 155 pg/g wet weight (ww) to 21 069 pg/g ww. Of the 14 OH-PBDE congeners assessed, as many as 10 congeners were identified, although profiles were generally dominated by 6-OH-BDE47 with lesser amounts of 2'-OH-BDE68, 4'-OH-BDE49, and 4-OH-BDE42. sigmaOH-PBDE concentrations ranged from 2.7 to 198 pg/g ww, with sigmaPBDE to sigmaOH-PBDE concentration ratios ranging from 0.0005 to 0.02. OH-PBDEs are likely derived in these freshwater species as metabolites of precursor PBDEs and are subsequently retained in the blood, for example, 6-OH-BDE47, 4'-OH-BDE49, and 4-OH-BDE42 could be derived from BDE47. Portions of concentrations of the OH-PBDEs may also be of alternate origins and are accumulated and retained in these fish. In all samples, the 14 MeO-PBDEs monitored were below detection (<0.01 pg/g ww). Anthropogenic triclosan concentrations ranged from 750 to >10 000 pg/g ww and is clearly a bioaccumulative halogenated phenolic compound in these fish. MeO-triclosan concentrations were considerably lower. In addition to emerging classes of brominated contaminant such as PBDEs, whether of metabolic or anthropogenic origin, fish collected from the Detroit River are exposed to a complex profile of PBDE-like organohalogens.
21112068	Serum and blubber of pup harbor (Phoca vitulina), grey (Halichoerus grypus) and harp (Phoca groenlandica) seals from the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Concentrations of ∑PBDEs (on lipid weight basis) in tissues of harbor seal pups inhabiting the St. Lawrence Estuary were about five times higher than in those from a colony located in the northern Gulf. Harp seal pups have the lowest levels of ∑PBDEs among the seal species born in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Lipid normalized concentrations of ∑PBDEs in serum and blubber were strongly correlated, suggesting that the blood collection as a less invasive method could be used to monitor ∑PBDEs in pups. This study shows that fluvial inputs of PBDEs are important to the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem and that inhabiting harbor seal pups have a substantial exposure to PBDEs at a critical developmental stage. In addition, the observed difference in PBDE levels between harp and grey or harbor seal pups from the Gulf of St. Lawrence is explained by the difference in diets of their mothers which is linked with their residency time in the Gulf and their seasonal migration pattern.
20864231	The uptake, elimination and transformation of six PBDE congeners (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -209) were studied in juvenile common sole (Solea solea L.) exposed to spiked contaminated food over a three-month period, and then depurated over a five-month period. Methoxylated (MeO-) and hydroxylated (OH-) PBDEs were determined in fish plasma exposed to PBDEs and compared to those obtained in control fish. While all MeO- and some OH- congeners identified in fish plasma were found to originate from non-metabolic sources, several OH- congeners, i.e., OH-tetraBDEs and OH-pentaBDEs, were found to originate from fish metabolism. Among these, 4'-OH-BDE-49 was identified as a BDE-47 metabolite. Congener 4'-OH-BDE-101, identified here for the first time, may be the result of BDE-99 metabolic transformation. Our results unequivocally showed that PBDEs are metabolised in juvenile sole via the formation of OH- metabolites. However, this was not a major biotransformation route compared to biotransformation through debromination.
19781992	The aim of the present study was to determine associations between the occurrence of PBDEs in breast milk of women and their demographic parameters. Participants were randomly recruited from the general population in southern Taiwan. Thirty two breast milk samples were collected and subsequently 30 congeners of PBDEs were analyzed using a high resolution gas chromatograph with a high resolution mass spectrometer. The mean and median of SigmaPBDEs were 3.54 and 3.31 ng/g lipid, respectively. SigmaPBDE levels in breast milk were not significantly correlated with age and pre-pregnant BMI of Taiwanese mothers. We did find, however, that the higher hexaBDE level was significantly related to older age (>29 years). Higher levels of SigmaPBDEs and higher brominated PBDEs, such as nonaBDEs and decaBDE, had slightly but not significantly negative correlations with lower pre-pregnant BMI (< or =21 kg/m(2)). There were no significant differences in PBDE levels among parity and ethnic groups. SigmaPBDE levels in Taiwanese breast milk were lower than those reported from the United States or Canada. SigmaPBDE levels of the present study (2007-2008) are significantly lower than those found in our previous report (2000-2001). Although our results were limited by the sampling size, preliminary results suggest the exploratory relations to show positive associations of PBDE homologues (e.g. triBDEs and hexaBDEs) with maternal age. PBDEs pattern of breast milk may have changed after pentaBDEs were stopped to use in Taiwan.
17698168	Decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 209) is the second most used brominated flame retardant (BFRs). Many studies have shown that some of the BFRs act as endocrine disruptors via alterations in thyroid hormone homeostasis and affect development. Little is known about the effect of prenatal exposure to PBDE 209 on the development in male offspring. Using a CD-1 mouse model, we attempt to estimate the possible effect of in utero exposure to PBDE 209 on thyroid hormone and hepatic enzymes activities in male offspring. Pregnant mice were administered different doses of PBDE 209 (10, 500, and 1500 mg/kg/day) or corn oil for controls per gavage from gestational days 0-17. In adult male offspring whose mothers had been treated with 1500 mg/kg of PBD 209, hepatic enzyme activity of S9 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) was weak but significantly increased (54%). However, no significant changes were observed in S9 4-nitrophenol uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) in any of the treatment groups. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) was found to have decreased significantly (ca. 21% both 10 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg) in offspring, but not thyroxine (T4). Histopathological examination revealed that prenatal exposure of PBDE 209 might be related with cell swelling of hepatocytes in male offspring and there were mild changes in the thyroid glands in 1500 mg/kg group. These data demonstrate that PBDE 209 is likely an endocrine disrupter in male mice following exposure during development. Further studies using environmentally relevant doses are needed for hazard identification.
19079722	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants have been implicated as disruptors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Animals exposed to PBDEs may show reduced plasma thyroid hormone (TH), but it is not known whether PBDEs impact TH-regulated pathways in target tissues. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of dietary exposure to 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE-47)-commonly the highest concentrated PBDE in human tissues-on plasma TH levels and on gene transcripts for glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit (GPHalpha) and thyrotropin beta-subunit (TSHbeta) in the pituitary gland, the auto-induced TH receptors alpha and beta in the brain and liver, and the TH-responsive transcription factor basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB) in the brain. METHODS: Breeding pairs of adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were given dietary PBDE-47 at two doses (2.4 microg/pair/day or 12.3 microg/pair/day) for 21 days. RESULTS: Minnows exposed to PBDE-47 had depressed plasma thyroxine (T(4)), but not 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)). This decline in T(4) was accompanied by elevated mRNA levels for TStHbeta (low dose only) in the pituitary. PBDE-47 intake elevated transcript for TH receptor alpha in the brain of females and decreased mRNA for TH receptor beta in the brain of both sexes, without altering these transcripts in the liver. In males, PBDE-47 exposure also reduced brain transcripts for BTEB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that dietary exposure to PBDE-47 alters TH signaling at multiple levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and provide evidence that TH-responsive pathways in the brain may be particularly sensitive to disruption by PBDE flame retardants. 
22236587	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), commonly used flame retardants, have been reported as potential endocrine disruptor and neurodevelopmental toxicants, thus giving rise to the public health concern. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between umbilical cord blood, maternal blood, and breast milk concentrations of PBDEs in South Korean. We assessed PBDE levels in paired samples of umbilical cord blood, maternal blood, and breast milk. The levels of seven PBDE congeners were measured in 21 paired samples collected from the Cheil Woman's Hospital (Seoul, Korea) in 2008. We also measured thyroid hormones levels in maternal and cord blood to assess the association between PBDEs exposure and thyroid hormone levels. However, there was no correlation between serum thyroxin (T4) and total PBDEs concentrations. The total PBDEs concentrations in the umbilical cord blood, maternal blood, and breast milk were 10.7±5.1 ng g(-1) lipid, 7.7±4.2 ng g(-1) lipid, and 3.0±1.8 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. The ranges of total PBDE concentrations observed were 2.28-30.94 ng g(-1) lipid in umbilical cord blood, 1.8-17.66 ng g(-1) lipid in maternal blood, and 1.08-8.66 ng g(-1) lipid in breast milk. BDE-47 (45-73% of total PBDEs) was observed to be present dominantly in all samples, followed by BDE-153. A strong correlation was found for major BDE-congeners between breast milk and cord blood or maternal blood and cord blood samples. The measurement of PBDEs concentrations in maternal blood or breast milk may help to determine the concentration of PBDEs in infant.
23724965	BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) has been suggested to negatively affect birth weight although epidemiological evidence is still inconclusive. We investigated if prenatal exposure to PCBs and PBDEs is related to birth weight in a Swedish population with background exposure. METHODS: Breast milk was sampled during the third week after delivery from first-time mothers in Uppsala county, Sweden 1996-2010 (POPUP cohort) (N = 413). Samples were analysed for di-ortho PCBs (CB-138, 153, 180) and tetra- to hexa- brominated PBDEs (BDE-47, 99, 100, 153). Simple and multiple linear regression models were used to investigate associations between lipid-adjusted, ln-transformed PCB and PBDE concentrations, and birth weight. Covariates included in the multivariate regression model were PCB and PBDE exposure, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, education, smoking, gender of the infant and gestational length. The effect of including fish consumption was also investigated. RESULTS: In the multivariate model, prenatal exposure to di-ortho PCBs was significantly associated with increased birth weight (β = 137; p = 0.02). The result did not change when gestational length was added to the model. An inverse association between PBDE(4) (sum of BDE-47, -99, -100 and -153) and birth weight was observed in the multivariate model including gestational length (β = -106; p = 0.04). Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain during pregnancy were important confounders of the association between di-ortho PCBs and birth weight. The associations were not alleviated after adjustment for fish consumption, a major source of PCB and PBDE exposure. The observed associations were stronger for boys than for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that prenatal exposure to di-ortho PCBs and PBDE(4) may influence birth weight in different directions, i.e. PCB exposure was associated with higher birth weight and PBDE exposure with lower birth weight. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain during pregnancy were important confounders that may hide positive association between di-ortho PCB exposure and birth weight if they are not included in the statistical model. We speculate that even small PCB- and PBDE-induced shifts in the distribution of birth weight may influence future public health in populations with background exposure. 
11482517	The ability of the commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) preparation Bromkal 70-5 DE to alter thyroid hormone and vitamin A levels as well as microsomal enzyme activities was compared with that of the commercial polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) preparation Aroclor 1254 in orally exposed female rats (Sprague-Dawley) and mice (C57BL/6 N). Additional mice were exposed to the PBDE congener 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (DE-47), or to the PCB congener 2,3,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl (CB-105). For 14 days the animals were given approximately isomolar daily oral doses of Aroclor 1254, CB-105 (both 10 mg/kg body weight), Bromkal 70-5 DE or DE-47 (both at 18 mg/kg body weight). In addition, further groups of rats and mice received a higher dose of Bromkal 70-5 DE, 36 mg/kg body weight. Bromkal 70-5 DE and DE-47 decreased plasma free and total thyroxine (T4) levels in both rats and mice, although with lower potency than that of Aroclor 1254 and CB-105. By contrast, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were not significantly changed in any of the groups. Reduction of hepatic vitamin A levels was seen in rats after Aroclor 1254 and Bromkal 70-5 DE exposure. A similar tendency was seen also in mice, but the effects were significant only for concentration data and not the total amount. Induction ofmicrosomal phase I enzymes, measured as ethoxy, methoxy and pentoxy resorufin O-dealkylase (EROD, MROD, PROD) activities, was greatest after exposure to Aroclor 1254/CB-105 but were also significant in the Bromkal 70-5 DE/DE-47-treated groups. However, induction of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT) was small and for most groups insignificant. In conclusion, the PBDE compounds studied, although having a lower potency than the PCB compounds, decreased thyroxine and vitamin A levels and induced microsomal enzyme activities. Rats were more sensitive to the observed effects than mice. Microsomal phase I activity might be related, directly or indirectly, to the T4 and vitamin A effects, whereas several factors (such as weak enzyme induction and lack of correlation with altered T4 and vitamin A levels) argue against any UDPGT-related effects.
21878423	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of persistent compounds that have been used as flame retardants in vehicles, household furnishings, and consumer electronics. This study examined whether concentrations of PBDEs in maternal serum during pregnancy were associated with infant birth weight, length, head circumference, and length of gestation. Participants were pregnant women (n = 286) enrolled in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) Study, a longitudinal cohort study of low-income, predominantly Mexican families living in the Salinas Valley, California. Blood samples were collected near the 26th week of pregnancy in 1999-2000, and concentrations of 10 PBDE congeners (BDE-17, -28, -47, -66, -85, -99, -100, -153, -154, and -183) were measured. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the association of lipid-adjusted, log(10)-transformed PBDE concentrations and birth outcome. In adjusted analyses, negative associations with birth weight were seen with BDE-47 (β = -115 g, 95% confidence interval (CI): -229, -2), BDE-99 (β = -114 g, 95% CI: -225, -4), and BDE-100 (β = -122 g, 95% CI: -235, -9). These findings were diminished slightly and were no longer statistically significant when maternal weight gain was included in the models. PBDE congeners were not associated with birth length, head circumference, or gestational duration.
21873374	Developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes hearing loss that may be due to reduced thyroxine during cochlear development. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are structurally similar to PCBs and reduce thyroxine. This study utilized an environmental PCB mixture and a commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, that represents the PBDEs found in humans to assess the potential for additive effects of PCBs and PBDEs on cochlear function. Female Long-Evans rats were dosed with corn oil vehicle, PCBs (3 or 6 mg/kg), molar equivalent doses of PBDEs (5.7 or 11.4 mg/kg), 3 mg/kg PCBs + 5.7 mg/kg PBDEs, or 6 mg/kg PCBs + 11.4 mg/kg PBDEs throughout gestation and lactation. At weaning, pup blood was taken to assess thyroxine concentrations. One male and one female from each litter were maintained until adulthood for distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements of cochlear function. DPOAE amplitudes were decreased and thresholds were elevated in the 6 mg/kg PCB group. Exposure to PBDEs did not cause DPOAE deficits. There was an interactive effect from combined exposure such that the individual low doses of PCBs and PBDEs did not result in DPOAE deficits, but the two combined produced a deficit similar to that in the high-dose PCB group. Serum thyroxine concentrations of all groups were reduced compared with controls, but PBDEs produced a less dramatic reduction than PCBs, which could explain the lack of DPOAE effects. Importantly, there was evidence that the co-exposure to subthreshold doses of PCBs and PBDEs can have an additive effect on cochlear function.
21468638	We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with adipose concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) among women undergoing surgical breast biopsies in the San Francisco Bay Area of California (n=78 cases; 56 controls). Adipose tissue was analyzed for the five major congeners of PBDEs. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate age- and race-adjusted exposure-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Adipose levels of PBDEs were among the highest ever reported. Adjusted ORs for the highest compared with lowest levels of exposures were as follows: 0.56 (95% CI 0.19-1.68) for BDE-47; 1.19 (95% CI 0.35-4.10) for BDE-99; 0.91 (95% CI 0.33-2.53) for BDE-100; 0.52 (95% CI 0.19-1.39) for BDE-153; 1.67 (95% CI 0.44-6.29) for BDE-154; 2.04 (95% CI 0.45-9.20) for total BDEs. These results provide no evidence of an association between PBDE adipose concentrations measured at or near the time of diagnosis and breast cancer risk. Our study was limited by a small sample size. Given the high levels of PBDEs found in this population of California women, future studies are warranted. Such studies would benefit from a larger sample size, a more representative control series, and/or a prospective design.
20951435	We measured major PBDEs and PCBs in breast adipose tissues of California women participating in a breast cancer study in the late 1990s. Samples were analyzed using gas chromatography with electron impact ionization and tandem mass spectrometry detection. The congener profile observed was: BDE47>BDE99>BDE153>BDE100>BDE154 and PCB153>PCB180>PCB138>PCB118. Whereas high correlations were observed within each chemical class, very weak correlations appeared between classes, pointing to different exposure pathways. Weak negative associations were observed for PBDE congeners and age. Our PBDE data are among the highest reported, exceeding data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and consistent with the high use of PBDEs in California. These data may be helpful in establishing a baseline for PBDE body burdens to gauge changes over time as a result of restrictions in the use of PBDE formulations.
17162494	Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) brominated flame retardants have recently been found to contaminate humans in the United States and other countries. U.S. human breast milk and blood levels of PBDEs are presently the highest in the world. U.S. cord blood samples tested positive for PBDEs, but until now there have been no peer-reviewed published data concerning levels of PBDEs in human tissue prior to and immediately after birth. Liver tissues were obtained from 4 stillborn fetuses and 7 liveborn infants, ranging from 20.5 to 39 wk gestational age; only 2 of the liveborn infants lived longer than 4 h and none were formula-fed or nursed, so tissue levels reflect intrauterine PBDE intake only. All samples were contaminated with PBDEs. Levels varied from 4 to 98 ppb, lipid. The mean level was 23.1 and the median 15.2 ppb, lipid. PBDE levels did not increase with gestational age. These data document the transfer of PBDEs from maternal to fetal tissue. PBDE concentrations are somewhat lower than those reported in adult blood or breast milk. The health consequences of prenatal contamination are not clear at present.
20204343	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and their derivatives, hydroxylated (OH) and methoxylated (MeO) PBDEs and methylsulfonylated (MeSO(2)) PCBs, were measured in sera of eight bird species collected from an e-waste recycling region in South China. Concentrations of summation operatorPCBs, ranging from 38 to 1700 ng/g lipid weight (lw), were one to two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of summation operatorPBDEs (0.64-580 ng/g lw). The significantly positive relationship between PCB and PBDE concentrations suggested a similar pathway of exposure to these compounds. Compared with muscle in birds, serum might prefer to accumulate and/or retain less brominated/chlorinated congeners. 3-OH-BDE47 and 2'-OH-BDE68 were detected in more than 80% of the collected bird serum samples (range: not detectable (nd) to 13 and nd to 7.8 ng/g lw, respectively). The other three OH-PBDE congeners (4'-OH-BDE-17, 6-OH-BDE47, and 4'-OH-BDE-49) and two MeO-PBDE congeners (3-MeO-BDE47 and 6-MeO-BDE47) were occasionally detected in bird sera at concentrations ranging from nd to 2.5 ng/g lw. Both natural sources and metabolic transformation of PBDEs could contribute to the presence of these PBDE derivatives in the birds. The two MeSO(2)-PCB congeners (4-MeSO(2)-CB49 and 4-MeSO(2)-CB101) under investigation were detected at respective concentration ranges of nd to 12 and nd to 0.68 ng/g lw. 4-MeSO(2)-CB101 exhibited the highest concentration among the nine PCB and PBDE derivatives studied, indicating that biotransformation via the mercapturic acid pathway of PCBs might have occurred in the studied bird species.
209972	Results of serum PBB determinations on 524 Michigan diary farm residents and consumers of products from the farms, 55 chemical workers, and 56 Wisconsin farm residents are reported. Mean and median values were highest for the chemical workers, followed by consumers from and residents of quarantined and nonquarantined farms. Serum DDE was higher among chemical workers, but was similar for all other groups. Statistical analysis of serum of PPB and serum DDE levels was done with respect to quarantine status, age, sex, and obesity. The most significant correlate with PBB was quarantine status. Serum DDE, age, sex, or obesity were not consistently correlated with serum PBB. For DDE, age was invariably the most significant correlate. Both serum PBB and DDE were higher in males than females in husband-wife pairs in most cases, although the differences occurred less frequently among older age groups. These results support the hypothesis that PBB exposure was a recent interim exposure whereas DDE exposure has been cumulative throughout a person's lifetime. Higher PBB and DDE mean concentrations in serum of Michigan Chemical workers suggests an occupational exposure to these chemicals.
21890170	In this study, we investigated concentration, congener distribution pattern, and effects of potential environmental factors that affect PBDE accumulation. We also estimated correlation between PBDE concentration and health status or thyroid function by analyzing 90 cord blood and 21 breast milk samples obtained from Korean population. Seven from tri- to hepta-BDEs were analyzed by solid phase extraction-high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (SPE-HRGC/HRMS). The total concentration of 7 PBDEs in cord blood was 2.786-94.64 ng g(-1) lipid and that in breast milk was 1.076-8.664 ng g(-1) lipid. Tetra-BDE (#47) was the predominant type of PBDE and was present at concentrations of over 40% in both sample types. A weak correlation was observed between the concentration of BDE28 and 153 and thyroid hormone concentration only in the breast milk samples. In children, a weak negative correlation was observed between free thyroxine (FT4) concentration and BDE28 concentration (0.302, p<0.05), while in mothers, a weak positive correlation was observed between thyroid hormone concentration and BDE153 concentration (0.403, p<0.05). No significant correlations between PBDE concentration and work and residential environments were found in this study, but a weak correlation between BDE concentration in cord blood and potential PBDE sources was confirmed by investigating the frequency of oil paint usage (0.510, p<0.001). A weak correlation was also found between PBDE concentration in breast milk during pregnancy and dietary habits such as green tea drinking (0.541, p=0.025) and Trichiuridae intake (0.565, p=0.015).
17485077	The determination of critical windows of susceptibility to environmental chemical exposures and health has become a major public health focus. This study examined the association between early age at exposure to polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and subsequent birth weight and gestational length in offspring among females. The study population consisted of 1111 births that occurred among 560 women enrolled in the Michigan PBB Cohort from 1975 to 1994. Maternal age at exposure was categorized into three groups:<10 years (n = 64), 11-16 years (n = 149), and 17-42 years (n = 347). Overall serum PBB levels ranged from 0 to 1490 ppb, with a median of 2, 3, and 2 ppb in the three age groups, respectively. Separate mixed-effects linear regression models were used to evaluate the effect of age at exposure (years) and initial PBB level (ppb) on birth weight (grams) and gestational age (weeks), controlling for gestational age (weeks) (in the model examining effects on birth weight), BMI (kg/m(2)) and serum PCB level at enrollment (ppb), maternal age and paternal education at delivery, parity, infant gender, interval between the initial serum test and date of delivery (years), and the trimester in which prenatal care was initiated. Relative to the oldest age group, age<10 years at exposure was the most important predictor of increased birth weight (estimated regression coefficient = 225 g, P = 0.012). Infant birth weight increased approximately 16 g for every 10 ppb increase in serum PBBs (P=0.004). There was no association between initial PBB levels and gestational age, nor were initial serum PCB levels associated with either infant birth weight or gestational length. These results provide support for the hypothesis that early age at exposure may be an important determinant in subsequent health effects due to environmental chemical exposures.
21495631	Breast milk samples collected during 2003-2005 from 82 first-time mothers in 24 communities located throughout California contained levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (∑(tri-hexa (8))PBDEs; median = 53.3 ng/g lw, range = 9.60-1291) and polychlorinated biphenyls (∑(12)PCBs; median = 73.4 ng/g lw, range = 22.2-433) that are among the highest in the world. PBDE levels varied 100-fold. BDE-47 was the dominant PBDE congener, with levels exceeding the U.S.EPA Reference Dose (RfD) for neurodevelopmental toxicity (100 ng/kg/day) in most (60%) breast milk samples. In some samples, BDE-209 (2/82) and/or BDE-153 (5/82) were the dominant congeners, suggesting that BDE-209 can transfer to breast milk and/or break down in the mother and transfer to the nursing infant as the lower-brominated PBDEs associated with adverse effects. PBDE levels in California breast milk are approaching those of PCBs, and the trend PBDEs > PCBs may continue as PBDEs migrate from products to the indoor and outdoor environments.
22771521	Hydroxylated (OH-) and methoxylated (MeO-) polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are suspected endocrine disruptors. Little is known about the accumulation or sources of these chemicals in tissues of humans, particularly those residing in Hong Kong, which is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Seven MeO-BDEs, fifteen OH-BDEs and three bromophenols (BRPs) were analyzed in blood plasma of 116 humans that had been collected by the Hong Kong Red Cross. Total concentrations of MeO-BDEs, OH-BDEs and BRPs ranged from 3.8×10² to 52×10³ pg g⁻¹ lipid (median 4.5×10³ pg g⁻¹), 5.3 to 4.9×10² pg g⁻¹ lipid (81 pg g⁻¹) and ND to 1.1×10² pg g⁻¹ lipid (3.7 pg g⁻¹), respectively. 3-MeO-BDE-47, 6-OH-BDE-47 and 2, 4, 5-TBP were the predominant MeO-BDEs, OH-BDEs and BRPs, respectively. These results are consistent with accumulation of MeO-BDEs, OH-BDEs and BRPs in human plasma being primarily from natural products and inter-conversion of natural products. Coefficients of determination for some pairs of congeners such as 3-OH-BDE-100 and 6-OH-BDE-47, 6-OH-BDE-85 and 5'-OH-BDE-99, and 2, 4-DBP and 6-OH-BDE-85, were near 1.0, which is consistent with them having common sources. Patterns of relative concentrations of the target analytes were similar in the diet, particularly fish, as in blood plasma of humans, which suggests that the diet and particularly seafood might be a source of these compounds and PBDEs. Furthermore, biotransformation of natural chemicals such as OH-BDEs to BRPs might be the primary route of their elimination from humans.
21059472	Human serum samples (n=61) were collected in Attika, Greece between June and October 2007 and analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Thirty samples were collected from computer clerks of a large computer company in Athens working full-time with computers, and thirty-one from a control population in the Attika region with no computer use. Σ(5)PBDE concentrations (sum of tri- to hexa-BDEs) in all samples (n=61) ranged from 0.68 to 13.3 ng g(-1) lipid, with a median of 1.07 ng g(-1) lipid. These concentrations are on the lower end of those reported from other countries, probably reflecting lower usage of PBDE-containing products or lower exposures to these chemicals. Individual and Σ(5)PBDE concentrations did not statistically differ between the two groups of computer clerks and non-computer users (p>0.05), with the exception of BDE 153 (p=0.033). The predominant congener was BDE 153, followed by BDEs 47, 100, 99, 183, 154 and 28. HBCD was also detected in 70% of the samples. BDE 209 was detected in 8 out 61 samples (13%), with concentrations ranging from 1.18 to 19.1 ng g(-1) lipid, and a median of 2.94 ng g(-1) lipid. No age dependency was found for PBDEs. Σ(11)PCB (sum of PCBs 74, 99, 118, 138, 146, 153, 156, 170, 180, 183 and 187,) in all samples (n=61) ranged from 36 to 402 ng g(-1) lipid, with a median of 110 ng g(-1) lipid. pp'-DDE concentrations ranged from 53.8 to 1649 ng g(-1) lipid, with a median of 268 ng g(-1) lipid. This is the first study to report levels of PBDEs in a possibly occupationally exposed subset of the Greek population.
20686340	Our goal in the present study was to evaluate whether decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), which is the most abundant polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) found in human samples, affects against target organs. Sprague-Dawley male rats were exposed to vehicle or BDE-209 (100, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight, daily) from postnatal day (PND) 10 to PND 42. There was no significant difference in body and male reproductive organ weight changes compared with controls. However, liver, thyroid and adrenal gland weights were significantly increased in the high-dose of BDE-209 group. BDE-209 significantly induced the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2, CYP3A1, and CYP2B1) enzymes in the liver. Furthermore, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR) expression levels were also increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentration was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone was significantly increased with BDE-209 treatment. In the histological findings, multiple areas of degenerated follicular epithelium and slight attenuation of the follicular epithelium were observed in the thyroid glands by high doses (300 and 600 mg/kg) of BDE-209 treatment. The presence of hepatocytic fatty degeneration and inflammatory foci were also observed in the 300 and 600 mg/kg of BDE-209 group. These findings demonstrate that BDE-209 induces hyperthyroidism and hepatotoxicity. In the future, further research is needed to determine the relationship between target organ toxicity and blood concentrations of BDE-209.
19499968	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) were determined in plasma of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from Charleston (CHS), South Carolina, and the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, U.S.A. Significantly lower sums (sigma) of PBDE concentrations (sum of 12 congeners) were found in animals from the IRL (arithmetic mean, 5.45 +/- 4.63 ng/g wet wt) compared with those from CHS (30 +/- 40 ng/g wet wt). Brominated diphenyl ether (BDE)-47 was the predominant PBDE in dolphins from the IRL (50% of the sigma PBDEs) and CHS (58%). The sigma PBDE concentrations in plasma of dolphins were negatively correlated with age at both locations. Fifteen and sixteen individual OH-PBDE congeners could be quantified in plasma of dolphins from IRL and CHS, respectively. Similar to sigma PBDE, mean sigma OH-PBDE concentrations were significantly higher in plasma of dolphins at CHS (1150 +/- 708 pg/g wet wt) compared with those at IRL (624 +/- 393 pg/g wet wt). The predominant congener at both locations was 6-OH-PBDE-47 (IRL, 384 +/- 319 pg/g wet wt; CHS, 541 +/- 344 pg/g wet wt), representing 61.5% of total sigma OH-PBDE at IRL and 47.0% at CHS. Concentrations of sigma OH-PBDEs were weakly negatively correlated with age in dolphins from both locations (p < 0.05; IRL, r2 = 0.048; CHS, r2 = 0.021). In addition to the OH-PBDE congeners identified with technical standards, eight and four unidentified OH-PBDEs were detected and quantified, respectively, in animals from CHS (sum of unidentified OH-PBDEs = 1.35 +/- 0.90 pg/g wet wt) and IRL (0.73 +/- 0.40 pg/g wet wt). Results of the present study suggest that, unlike OH-PCBs, OH-PBDEs in bottlenose dolphins are minor products in plasma relative to sigma PBDEs and a significant proportion may be a consequence of the dietary uptake of naturally produced methoxylated- and OH-PBDEs.
15902483	OBJECTIVES: Personnel working with electronic dismantling are exposed to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which in animal studies have been shown to alter thyroid homeostasis. The aim of this longitudinal study was to measure plasma level of PBDEs in workers at an electronic recycling facility and to relate these to the workers' thyroid status. METHODS: PBDEs and three thyroid hormones: triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxin (T(4)) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were repeatedly analysed in plasma from 11 workers during a period of 1.5 years. RESULTS: Plasma levels of PBDEs at start of employment were <0.5-9.1 pmol/g lipid weight (l.w.). The most common congener was PBDE #47 (median 2.8 pmol/g l.w.), followed by PBDE #153 (median 1.7 pmol/g l.w.), and PBDE #183 had a median value of <0.19 pmol/g l.w. After dismantling the corresponding median concentrations were: 3.7, 1.7 and 1.2 pmol/g l.w., respectively. These differences in PBDE levels were not statistically significant. PBDE #28 showed a statistically significantly higher concentration after dismantling than at start of employment (P=0.016), although at low concentrations (start 0.11 pmol/g l.w. and dismantling 0.26 pmol/g l.w.). All measured levels of thyroid hormones (T(3), T(4) and TSH) were within the normal physiological range. Statistically significant positive correlations were found between T(3) and #183 in a worker, between T(4) and both #28 and #100 in another worker and also between TSH and #99 and #154 in two workers. CONCLUSIONS: The workers' plasma levels of PBDEs fluctuated during the study period. Due to small changes in thyroid hormone levels it was concluded that no relevant changes were present in relation to PBDE exposure within the workers participating in this study. 
21478060	Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) provides improved resolution, speed and sensitivity compared to conventional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this study, a robust UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed for the rapid determination of nine hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) in rat plasma. Under the optimized conditions, the OH-PBDE congeners were eluted within 7.0 min. The limits of quantification defined at the signal-to-noise ratio of 10 were 0.17-2.78 ng/mL in rat plasma. The method provided good linearity for the calibration curves with recoveries of 93.3-114.0% and repeatability with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.6-5.8% for intra-day and 3.2-10.4% for inter-day measurements. The developed method was applied for supporting the pharmacokinetics investigation of 6-OH-BDE-47 in two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats that received, respectively a single dose of 0.60 mg/kg (high dose) and 0.15 mg/kg (low dose) by intravenous injection. The results showed that plasma levels of 6-OH-BDE-47 declined bi-exponentially with elimination half-life of 71.7 and 85.6 min for lower and higher dose group, respectively. The obtained results of short elimination half-life suggested that 6-OH-BDE-47 might not accumulate significantly in rat.
21565681	OBJECTIVE: To study correlations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DIOXIN, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) with thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) in children, and assess the impact on children's health. METHODS: Three hundred and sixty nine children aged from 6 to 8, including 195 from Luqiao, the computer E-waste recycling area, and 174 from Longyou, the control area, were selected for this investigation to elucidate the correlation of PCBs, DIOXIN, and PBDE with TSH in children's blood samples. The children had a physical examination and their blood levels of PCBs, DIOXIN, PBDE, and TSH were detected after sample collection. RESULTS: In the E-waste recycling area, the contents of PCBs, PBDE, DIOXIN, and TSH in the blood samples of children were 484.00 ± 84.86 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 664.28 ± 262.38 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 26.00 ± 19.58 ng·g(-1) lipid weight and 1.88 ± 0.42 μIU/mL (serum) respectively, while in the control area, the PCBs, PBDE, DIOXIN, and TSH contents were 255.38 ± 95 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 375.81 ± 262.43 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, 39.64 ± 31.86 ng·g(-1) lipid weight, and 3.31±1.04 μIU/mL respectively. CONCLUSION: The health status of children in the control area are better than that in the contaminated area. Among children who are exposed to persistent organic pollutants, the pollutant content increases significantly in their serum, and the distribution of TSH levels in their bodies are also affected. 
20103495	BACKGROUND: Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants is widespread, with 97% of Americans having detectable levels. Although PBDEs have been associated with reproductive and hormonal effects in animals, no human studies have examined their association with fertility. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine whether maternal concentrations of PBDEs in serum collected during pregnancy are associated with time to pregnancy and menstrual cycle characteristics. METHODS: Pregnant women (n = 223) living in a low-income, predominantly Mexican-immigrant community in California were interviewed to determine how many months they took to become pregnant. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for PBDEs. PBDE concentrations were lipid adjusted and log10 transformed. Analyses were limited to PBDE congeners detected in > 75% of the population (BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153). Cox proportional hazards models modified for discrete time were used to obtain fecundability odds ratios (fORs) for the association of PBDEs and time to pregnancy. RESULTS: We detected all four congeners in > 97% of women. Increasing levels of BDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and the sum of these four congeners were all associated with longer time to pregnancy. We observed significantly reduced fORs for BDE-100 [adjusted fOR = 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9], BDE-153 (adjusted fOR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8), and the sum of the four congeners (adjusted fOR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.0). PBDEs were not associated with menstrual cycle characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant decreases in fecundability associated with PBDE exposure in women. Future studies are needed to replicate and confirm this finding. 
18439655	This study was conducted to explore the exposure potential of Chinese residents to PBBs, PBDEs, and PCBs in e-waste disassembly sites in Zhejiang province. The contents of 23 PBB congeners, 12 PBDE congeners, and 27 PCB congeners in hair and in their potential sources, including soil and e-waste, were measured via GC-MS. The levels of PHAHs in the three subfamilies (i.e., the PBBs, PBDEs, and PCBs) were all considerably higher (P<0.05) in hair samples collected from the disassembly sites than from the control site. The highest levels of PBBs (57.77 ng g(-1) dw), PBDEs (29.64 ng g(-1) dw), and PCBs (181.99 ng g(-1) dw) in hair were all found in those from the disassembly site Xinqiu, which are respectively 2, 2, and 10 times more than those observed in hair from the control site Yandang. Among the three subfamilies of PHAHs, PCBs were the most predominant pollutants detected. PBBs, which have very limited information available in China, can be detected at a comparable level with PBDEs in these samples in the study. Therefore, these observations suggested that more attention should be given over the potential for environmental or occupational exposure to PHAHs present in e-waste. By and large, the PHAH levels measured in the hair samples were consistent with those detected in the soil. Hair analysis could thus be a valid screening tool for assessing human PHAHs exposure in and around e-waste disassembly sites.
18313098	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) are brominated flame retardants that are produced in large quantities and are commonly used in construction materials, textiles, and as polymers in electronic equipment. Environmental and human levels of PBDEs have been increasing in the past 30 years, but the toxicity of PBDEs is not fully understood. Studies on their effects are relatively limited, and show that PBDEs are neurotoxins and potential endocrine disrupters. Hydroxylated (OH) and methoxylated (MeO) PBDEs have also been reported in the adipose tissue, blood and milk of wild animals and humans. In the present study, 15 PBDE metabolites, two BDE mixtures (DE71 and DE79), and TBBPA were studied individually to determine their effects on ten steroidogenic genes, aromatase activity, and concentrations of two steroid hormones (testosterone and 17beta-estradiol) in the H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line. Exposure to 0.05 microM 2'-OH-BDE-68 significantly induced the expression of CYP11A, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, 3betaHSD2, 17betaHSD1, and 17betaHSD4, and the expression of StAR was induced by 6-OH-BDE-90 at the three exposure concentrations. Exposure to DE71 and DE79 resulted in dose-dependent trend towards induction, but these effects were not significant. Exposure to 0.5 microM 2-OH-BDE-123 and 2-MeO-BDE-123 resulted in significantly greater aromatase activity. However, none of the compounds affected sex hormone production at the concentrations tested. Generally, OH-BDEs had a much stronger ability to affect steroidogenic gene expression than MeO-BDEs.
12547481	PURPOSE: We examined the relation between serum polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) levels and the risk of benign breast disease in a cohort of Michigan women unintentionally exposed to PBBs in 1973 and interviewed in 1997. METHODS: We used extended Cox models to generate adjusted hazard ratios; models included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and risk factors for benign breast disease reported in the literature. RESULTS: Two hundred fourteen (23%) of 951 women reported benign breast disease diagnosed by a physician. Compared with women with low PBB exposure, benign breast disease was not reported more frequently among those with moderate (>1-12 parts per billion [ppb]), (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80-1.45), or high (>12 ppb), (OR 0.79, 95% CI = 0.46-1.38) PBB exposure. PCB exposure was also not associated with self-reported physician-diagnosed benign breast disease. Age, smoking, and annual number of health-care provider visits were significantly associated with benign breast disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis did not demonstrate an association between serum PBB level and self- reported physician-diagnosed benign breast disease. We did observe an increased risk of benign breast disease for women who smoked, an association that has not been consistently found in previous studies. 
10656855	Accidental contamination of the food chain in Michigan in 1973 with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) led to the establishment of a registry of exposed individuals in 1976. Serum was collected and analyzed for PBB at the time of enrollment and for targeted studies in the following years. We used the archived PBB data to study the elimination of PBB and to identify factors associated with elimination. A total of 380 women >= 16 years of age who had an initial PBB level of 2 ppb and at least two serum samples drawn when they were not pregnant were included in the analysis. The mean initial PBB level was 20.9 ppb (median 4) and mean time between the first and last measurement was 4.2 years (range 0.5-11.1). PBB was assumed to reach equilibrium in the body before substantial amounts were eliminated and before the first serum measurements were taken; therefore, the entire body was modeled as a single compartment for PBB with exponential decay. Subject-specific decay rate estimates were regressed on predictor variables including initial age, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, breast-feeding duration, and parity. In women with an initial PBB level < 10 ppb, the median half-life was 12.9 years; in those with > 10 ppb, the median half-life was 28.7 years. Decay was significantly slower among women with an initial BMI at or above the median (BMI >= 23). The calculated half-life values are estimates of decay and can be used to estimate body burden of PBB at various points in time other than at the time of serum collection.
18466040	Levels and distribution of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in various tissues of hens foraging near an electronic wastes stack spot in Taizhou, China, were studied. With high-resolution gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry analysis, 37 PBDE congeners from di- to hepta-brominated and BDE 209 were identified and quantified in the liver, heart, skin, fat, intestine, muscle, blood, oviduct, ovum, gizzard, spleen, and kidney tissues of hens. Based on lipid weight in all analyzed tissues, muscle exhibited the highest PBDE concentrations (17,977 ng/g lipid wt), BDE 209 was the dominant congener, and the sum of quantified PBDEs followed the order muscle > fat > intestine > heart > liver > oviduct > gizzard > blood > skin > ovum. Principal component analysis results indicated that the hen muscle tissue was characterized by BDE 32, 209, 28, and 75 congeners; hen intestine, heart, and blood tissues were characterized by BDE 153, 99, 183, 138, 154, 47, and 100 congeners; and hen skin, liver, oviduct, ovum, gizzard, spleen, kidney, and fat tissues had a similar PBDE congener profile. The present study also indicated that the PBDE congeners were persistent enough to accumulate through the human food chain and that deca-BDE might be potential risk to ecoenvironment.
18335110	OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in a young urban population in a developing country, with focus on potentially highly exposed children working informally as scrap scavengers at a large municipal waste disposal site. We also set out to investigate whether hydroxylated metabolites, which not hitherto have been found retained in humans, could be detected. METHODS: We assessed PBDEs in pooled serum samples obtained in 2002 from children 11-15 years of age, working and sometimes also living at the municipal waste disposal site in Managua, and in nonworking urban children. The influence of fish consumption was evaluated in the children and in groups of women 15-44 years of age who differed markedly in their fish consumption. Hydroxylated PBDEs were assessed as their methoxylated derivates. The chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, using authentic reference substances. RESULTS: The children living and working at the waste disposal site showed very high levels of medium brominated diphenyl ethers. The levels observed in the referent children were comparable to contemporary observations in the United States. The exposure pattern was consistent with dust being the dominating source. The children with the highest PBDE levels also had the highest levels of hydroxylated metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, very high levels of PBDEs were found in children from an urban area in a developing country. Also, for the first time, hydroxylated PBDE metabolites were found to bioaccumulate in human serum. 
19269001	Flame retardants (FRs) constitute a group of compounds that are added to materials in order to suppress, reduce, or delay fire. At present the most used FRs are the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and diverse studies have found individuals exposed to them. However, few studies have reported data in children. The objective of this report was to assess PBDEs levels in children of six communities in México. During the year 2006 we analyzed a total of 173 healthy children (aged 6-13 years old). Plasma samples were taken and quantified (gas chromatography/mass spectrometer) for PBDEs. Six PBDEs congeners (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, and BDE-209) were quantified in blood serum. We detected exposure to PBDEs in all the communities. The total PBDEs levels ranged from no detectable (nd) to 43.4 ng g(-1) lipid, the dominant PBDE congener was BDE-47, followed by BDE-100, BDE-99 and BDE-153, whereas the levels of BDE-209 were below LOD. Children living in an industrial and urban area (Cd. Juarez, Chih) had the highest levels of PBDEs, approximately two times that of children living in El Refugio, S.L.P. (a rural area) or in Milpillas, S.L.P. (municipal landfill) and 4-5 times higher than levels found in children living in San Luis Potosi, S.L.P. (urban area), in Chihuahua, Chih. (urban area), and San Juan Tilapa, Edo. Mex. (municipal landfills). Results cannot be generalized since the communities selected are not representative of the Mexican population. However, they do indicate that Mexican children are exposed to PBDEs.
18186101	Very high concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) have been reported in fish from Lake Mjøsa in Norway. This study was performed to examine the serum concentrations of PBDE and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in consumers of fish from this lake and to investigate possible relationships between serum concentrations, self-reported fish intake and calculated total dietary PBDE exposure. Serum concentrations of the sum of the seven PBDE (BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183) were significantly higher than those of a reference group of Norwegians eating only food with background levels of contamination (medians: 18 ng/g lipids men, 8.4 ng/g lipids women). The median dietary intake of Sum 7 PBDE was 2549 ng/day (30 ng/kg body weight/day), the highest dietary intake of PBDE reported. The contribution from fish caught from the contaminated lake comprised 98.7% of the total dietary exposure. For men, serum levels of PBDE were strongly correlated with the calculated dietary exposure, except for BDE-209. This suggests that sources other than the diet are important for human BDE-209 exposure. The median serum HBCD concentration was 4.1 and 2.6 ng/g lipids for men and women, respectively, and was also found to be associated with consumption of fish from Lake Mjøsa.
21715241	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are chemical additives used as flame retardants in commercial products. PBDEs are bioaccumulative and persistent and have been linked to several adverse health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study leverages an ongoing pregnancy cohort to measure PBDEs and PBDE metabolites in serum collected from an understudied population of pregnant women late in their third trimester. A secondary objective was to determine whether the PBDEs or their metabolites were associated with maternal thyroid hormones. METHODS: One hundred forty pregnant women > 34 weeks into their pregnancy were recruited into this study between 2008 and 2010. Blood samples were collected during a routine prenatal clinic visit. Serum was analyzed for a suite of PBDEs, three phenolic metabolites (i.e., containing an -OH moiety), and five thyroid hormones. RESULTS: PBDEs were detected in all samples and ranged from 3.6 to 694 ng/g lipid. Two hydroxylated BDE congeners (4´-OH-BDE 49 and 6-OH-BDE 47) were detected in > 67% of the samples. BDEs 47, 99, and 100 were significantly and positively associated with free and total thyroxine (T4) levels and with total triiodothyronine levels above the normal range. Associations between T4 and PBDEs remained after controlling for smoking status, maternal age, race, gestational age, and parity. CONCLUSIONS: PBDEs and OH-BDEs are prevalent in this cohort, and levels are similar to those in the general population. Given their long half-lives, PBDEs may be affecting thyroid regulation throughout pregnancy. Further research is warranted to determine mechanisms through which PBDEs affect thyroid hormone levels in developing fetuses and newborn babies. 
17204274	A fast extraction and clean-up method for the simultaneous determination of PCBs and PBDEs has been developed. The procedure consisted of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) of the analytes on an Oasis HLB cartridge and the subsequent on-line fat elimination by directly dropping the eluate from the SPE cartridge onto a second cartridge containing layers of activated neutral silica gel and sulphuric acid modified silica gel. Detection limits using a gas chromatography coupled with an ion trap detector in the tandem mass spectrometry mode were from 0.03 to 0.3 pg/microL for PCBs and from 0.07 to 1.3 pg/microL for PBDEs. Repeatability (lower than 11%) and reproducibility (lower than 17%), expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD, n=4), were satisfactory. The feasibility of the method developed for the determination of the target compounds was evaluated by participation in several rounds of interlaboratory exercises involving human serum with a wide range of PBDE and PCB concentrations. The method has been applied to the evaluation of PBDEs and PCBs in human serum samples of up to 1 mL.
14754569	In Wisconsin, consumption of Great Lakes fish is an important source of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and other halogenated hydrocarbons, all of which may act as potential risk factors for breast cancer. We examined the association between sport-caught fish consumption and breast cancer incidence as part of an ongoing population-based case-control study. We identified breast cancer cases 20-69 years of age who were diagnosed in 1998-2000 (n = 1,481) from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System. Female controls of similar age were randomly selected from population lists (n = 1,301). Information about all sport-caught (Great Lakes and other lakes) fish consumption and breast cancer risk factors was obtained through telephone interviews. After adjustment for known and suspected risk factors, the relative risk of breast cancer for women who had recently consumed sport-caught fish was similar to women who had never eaten sport-caught fish [relative risk (RR) = 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-1.17]. Frequency of consumption and location of sport-caught fish were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Recent consumption of Great Lakes fish was not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.07), whereas risk associated with premenopausal breast cancer was elevated (RR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16-2.50). In this study we found no overall association between recent consumption of sport-caught fish and breast cancer, although there may be an increased breast cancer risk for subgroups of women who are young and/or premenopausal.
16414171	Considering the presence of polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) in human milk and cord blood, and the estrogenic activity of some congeners, it is conceivable that PBDEs may interact with developing neuroendocrine systems. We investigated effects of 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromo-DE (PBDE 99), a major congener in human milk, on development of brain and reproductive organs, with focus on estrogen target gene expression. Time-pregnant Long Evans rats were subcutaneously injected with PBDE 99 (1 or 10 mg/kg/day), the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (10 mg/kg/day), known to interfere with sexual development, or vehicle, from gestational day (GD) 10 to GD 18. In female offspring, anogenital distance was unaffected by PBDE 99 but increased by Aroclor; puberty (vaginal opening) was not significantly changed. Adult PBDE 99-exposed offspring exhibited unchanged uterine weight but increased ovarian weight. Uterine mRNA levels of estrogen target genes were determined by real-time PCR. Progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA was down-regulated at both PBDE 99 doses, estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), ER beta and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were up-regulated at the lower dose. Aroclor induced different effect patterns. In order to investigate possible changes in sensitivity of target genes to estrogen, some offspring were ovariectomized at 10 weeks of age, s.c. injected with estradiol-17beta (E2, 10 microg/kg) or vehicle at 12 weeks, and sacrificed 6 h later. PBDE 99 dose-dependently reduced the magnitude of IGF-I mRNA induction by E2, and increased the magnitude of ER beta repression. PBDE 99 also influenced baseline levels of PR, IGF-I and ER beta mRNAs in ovariectomized, vehicle-injected controls. These data indicate that developmental exposure to PBDE 99 at doses devoid of general toxicity, affects the regulation of estrogen target genes in uterus. Since PBDE 99 was detected in blood and adipose tissue of adult offspring, these effects may result from interactions with developmental processes, adult functions, or a combination of both.
20049208	BACKGROUND: Human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is virtually universal in the United States. Although the uses of these chemicals as flame retardants in fabrics, foams, and plastics are well defined, human exposure pathways are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess current PBDE body burdens and identify residential sources of exposure among 29 men and 15 women in 38 households. METHODS: Portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzers were used to measure bromine levels in upholstered furnishings, bedding, vehicle interiors, and electronic devices. Vacuum cleaner contents, indoor air samples, and blood sera were analyzed for PBDE congeners using conventional gas chromatograph methods. RESULTS: Bromine levels varied widely within similar household items. The greatest range for upholstered items was found among vehicle seat cushions (7-30,600 ppm). For electronic devices, television sets ranged from 4 ppm to 128,300 ppm. Based on mixed effects modeling, adjusting for couple households, the bromine content in the participants' sleeping pillows and primary vehicle seat cushions were the strongest predictors of log lipid-adjusted blood serum PBDE concentrations (p-values = 0.005 and 0.03, respectively). The total pentaBDE congener levels found in dust samples and in passive air samples were not significant predictors of blood sera levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the usefulness of the portable XRF analyzer in identifying household items that may contribute to human exposure to PBDEs. 
15488571	The isotope dilution technique was applied for the analysis of new polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) calibration standard (both labeled and non-labeled) using high-resolution gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS). The relative response factor (RRF) and relative standard deviation (RSD) for new calibration standard in Finnigan Thermo Electron (MAT-95XL) and Micromass (Autospec Ultima) were more or less identical with mean RRF (0.9882), RSD (0.0865) and CV% of (8.75). The results also revealed for DeBDE-209 quantification; labeled DeBDE-209 is essential. Furthermore, we recommend on column injection technique with a thin film instead of splitless injection in order to reduce the thermal degradation of DeBDE-209 and formation of octabromodibenzofurans (OBDF). Besides, analysis of human blood (n = 156) of FEBRA-intake and non-FEBRA-intake individuals elucidated frequent detection of eighteen PBDE congeners. The average PBDE concentrations in non-FEBRA intake and FEBRA-intake humans were 6000-11,000 (mean: 8400) and 5400-15,000 (mean: 9900) respectively on pg/g fat basis. Although FEBRA-intake individuals showed slightly greater PBDEs, computer-normalized concentrations of TeBDE-47 corroborate FEBRA-intake individual from four family showed reduced concentrations. The contamination profiles of PBDEs varied in between family, gender as well as geography. International comparison with predominant PBDE congener (TeBDE-47) prevailed lower levels in Japan when compared to Korea, Germany and USA nevertheless, congener specific profiles were different which is in accordance with different technical PBDE usage in between countries.
21498147	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), which are used as flame retardants, have been found to be higher in residents of California than of other parts of the United States. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the role of immigration to California on PBDE levels in Latino children. METHODS: We compared serum PBDE concentrations in a population of first-generation Mexican-American 7-year-old children (n = 264), who were born and raised in California [Center for Health Analysis of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study], with 5-year-old Mexican children (n = 283), who were raised in the states in Mexico where most CHAMACOS mothers had originated (Proyecto Mariposa). RESULTS: On average, PBDE serum concentrations in the California Mexican-American children were three times higher than their mothers' levels during pregnancy and seven times higher than concentrations in the children living in Mexico. The PBDE serum concentrations were higher in the Mexican-American children regardless of length of time their mother had resided in California or the duration of the child's breast-feeding. These data suggest that PBDE serum concentrations in these children resulted primarily from postnatal exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Latino children living in California have much higher PBDE serum levels than their Mexican counterparts. Given the growing evidence documenting potential health effects of PBDE exposure, the levels in young children noted in this study potentially present a major public health challenge, especially in California. In addition, as PBDEs are being phased out and replaced by other flame retardants, the health consequences of these chemical replacements should be investigated and weighed against their purported fire safety benefits. 
17448678	PURPOSE: We examined the association between endometriosis and exposure to polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) among women inadvertently exposed to PBBs in 1973. METHODS: Serum PBBs and PCBs were measured in the late 1970s. Women self-reported endometriosis at interview in 1997. We constructed Cox models to estimate the relative incidence of endometriosis in relation to PBB and PCB levels. RESULTS: Seventy-nine of 943 women (9%) reported endometriosis. Compared with women with low PBB exposure (<or=1 parts per billion [ppb]), women with moderate PBB (1-4 ppb) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.31) and high PBB (>or=4 ppb) (HR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.51-1.59) exposure did not have increased incidence of endometriosis. Increased incidence of endometriosis was suggested among women exposed to moderate PCB (5-8 ppb) (HR = 1.67; 95% CI, 0.91-3.10) and high PCB (>or=8 ppb) (HR = 1.68; 95% CI, 0.95-2.98) levels compared with low PCB exposure (<or=5 ppb). CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support an association between PBB exposure and endometriosis. Findings for serum PCB level are consistent with an emerging body of literature suggesting an association between PCB exposure and endometriosis. 
22847182	The purpose of this study was to measure levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the blood of children (50 individuals) living in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. We analyzed six PBDE congeners by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total PBDE levels ranged from not detectable (nd) to 15.2 μg/L on a whole-weight basis and from nd to 6,435 ng/g lipid on a lipid-weight basis. The dominant congener in our study was BDE-153, followed by BDE-154, BDE-99, BDE-100, and BDE-47. Levels of BDE-209 were below the detection limit. Our data indicate that children living in the areas studied in this work are exposed to high levels of PBDEs.
21376977	We describe a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the simultaneous determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in sheep serum samples. The denaturation of serum proteins by formic acid, water-1-propanol and water-2-propanol were compared and optimized. Seven different solid-phase sorbents were tested and it was found that Strata-X cartridge (200mg, 6 mL) gave the best recoveries (92-106%, SD<6%, n=3) for all the target analytes. The different extraction solvents (iso-hexane and dichloromethane), either alone or in combination, were used to extract these persistent organic compounds from spiked serum samples by SPE. Removal of co-extracted biogenic materials was achieved using adsorption chromatography with acid modified silica and activated silica. Iso-hexane was found to be the most appropriate solvent for clean-up providing good recoveries and clear chromatographic separation; its use is preferable to that of DCM because it is less environmentally toxic. The limits of detection (LOD) of the proposed method were 47-105 pg g(-1) and 16-24 pg g(-1) for the different PBDEs and PCBs studied, respectively. The developed method was linear over the range from 0.05 to 30 ng g(-1), for all PBDEs except PBDE 183 (0.10-30 ng g(-1)), and from 0.02 to 30 ng g(-1) for all tested PCB congeners. The established method was successfully applied to sheep serum samples from Scotland, UK, for the determination of the target PBDEs and PCBs.
17120554	Lack of human exposure data is frequently reported as a critical gap in risk assessments of environmental pollutants, especially regarding "new" pollutants. The objectives of this study were to assess serum levels of the persistent 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153), hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites (OH-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and hexabromocyclodode-canes (HBCDDs) in a group of Swedish middle-aged and elderly women expected to be relatively highly exposed, and to evaluate the impact of potential determinants (e.g., fish intake, age) for the inter-individual variation, as well as to investigate the association between these pollutants and bone density. No associations were found between bone mineral density or biochemical markers of bone metabolism and the analyzed environmental pollutants. Relatively high levels of CB-153 (median 260 ng/g fat) and sigma 3-OH-PCBs (median 1.7 ng/mL serum), and low concentrations of sigma6PBDEs (median 3.6 ng/g fat) were determined. Total level of HBCDDs in serum was quantified by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (median 0.5 ng/g fat). HBCDD diastereomeric and enantiomeric patterns were determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The dominating stereoisomer was (-)alpha-HBCDD, but 1-3% of gamma-HBCDD was also detected in the serum samples.
11712998	In the early 1970s, the largest industrial accident in the United States resulted in widespread contamination of the food supply in Michigan with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs). The chemical similarity of PBBs to compounds implicated as endocrine disruptors has raised the question of whether PBBs could affect the reproductive system. In the present analysis we examine the relation between serum measurements of PBBs and the frequency and duration of lactation. Persons who lived on or received food from farms exposed to PBBs were enrolled in a registry by the Michigan Department of Public Health. Female members of the cohort were invited to participate in a telephone survey of reproductive outcomes. The three outcomes of interest in the present analysis were a) the decision to breast-feed (yes/no); b) the duration, in months, of breast-feeding as the main source of nutrition; and c) the total duration, in months, of breast-feeding. None of the three outcomes was significantly associated with serum PBB levels, even after controlling for maternal age, previous history of breast-feeding, body mass index, maternal education, household income, history of smoking in the year before pregnancy, consumption of alcohol during the first trimester of pregnancy, history of thyroid disorder, gestational age of the infant in weeks, time to pregnancy, and year of birth.
16524616	Workers at an electronics recycling plant have previously been shown to have elevated serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) compared to referents without occupational PBDE exposure. Subsequent structural changes and industrial hygiene measures at the plant were applied to improve the work environment. The present study aims to assess the impact of these work environment changes on the occupational exposure to PBDEs. Blood were drawn from the workers and analyzed at two different laboratories, and serum concentrations of several PBDE congeners were determined by GC/MS or GC/HRMS. Cross-sectional studies were performed prior to (in 1997; N=19) and after (in 2000; N=27) workplace improvements. Longitudinal studies were performed on twelve of the workers that were sampled at both occasions. Even though the amount of processed goods had doubled in 2000 as compared to 1997, there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of BDE-183 and BDE-209. For BDE-209 the levels observed in year 2000 were even lower than in referents with no occupational exposure. In contrast to the decrease of higher brominated diphenyl ethers, the concentrations of BDE-47 did not significantly change. For BDE-153, the cross-sectional study indicated no change, whereas the longitudinal follow up indicated a significant increase. This study shows that the industrial hygiene improvements clearly reduced the occupational exposure to BDE-183 and BDE-209 at the plant. Still, the levels of hexa- to nonaBDEs but not BDE-209 were elevated, compared to referents with no occupational exposure.
17366822	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have raised concerns about polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardant exposures to pregnant women and women of child-bearing age in the United States. Few studies have measured PBDEs in immigrant populations. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to characterize levels of seven PBDE congeners, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153, and polybrominated biphenyl (PBB)-153 in plasma from 24 pregnant women of Mexican descent living in an agricultural community in California. RESULTS: The median concentration of the sum of the PBDE congeners was 21 ng/g lipid and ranged from 5.3 to 320 ng/g lipid. Consistent with other studies, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) was found at the highest concentration (median = 11 ng/g lipid; range, 2.5-205) followed by 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromobiphenyl (BDE-99) (median = 2.9 ng/g lipid; range, 0.5-54), 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE-100) (median = 1.8 ng/g lipid; range, 0.6-44), and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaBDE (BDE-153) (median = 1.5 ng/g lipid; range, 0.4-35). Levels of PCB-153 (median= 4.4 ng/g lipid; range, < 2-75) were lower than U.S. averages and uncorrelated with PBDE levels, suggesting different exposure routes. CONCLUSIONS: The overall levels of PBDEs found were lower than levels observed in other U.S. populations, although still higher than those observed previously in Europe or Japan. The upper range of exposure is similar to what has been reported in other U.S. populations. PBDEs have been associated with adverse developmental effects in animals. Future studies are needed to determine the sources and pathways of PBDE exposures and whether these exposures have adverse effects on human health. 
17964055	In the present study coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) adapted to Balb/c mice was used to examine whether infection affects xenobiotic-metabolising CYP1A1 and CYP2B gene expression (measured by RT-PCR) and the corresponding enzyme activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase (PROD), as observed on day 3 of infection. To study the simultaneous effects of xenobiotic exposure, mice were administered the polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) compounds BDE-99 (single congener) and Bromkal 70-5 DE (commercial mixture). Serum thyroxine levels were also measured. High numbers of CVB3 were found in the livers of infected mice but no significant effects of PBDE on virus replication were observed. In infected mice gene expression and CYP activities were decreased in comparison with non-infected mice, especially for CYP2B. PBDE exposure in the non-infected mice was characterised by an increase in both CYP2B and PROD levels/activities, whereas CYP1A levels increased and EROD activity decreased. In general, PBDE exposure in the infected mice did not increase EROD and PROD activities to the same extent as in the non-infected exposed mice. Infected mice exposed to BDE-99 showed significantly higher CYP2B and PROD levels than both the infected non-exposed and Bromkal-exposed groups. T(4) levels were greatly decreased by infection and a tendency of reduced T(4) levels after PBDE exposure could be observed in non-infected mice. In conclusion, infection reduced the detoxifying capacity of the liver and the serum T(4) levels. PBDE exposure can modify these effects. Notably, in the infected mice differences between BDE-99 and Bromkal were observed on CYP2B gene expression and PROD activity.
21106438	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) causing thyroidal effects have been demonstrated in in vivo and in vitro studies. PBDEs with structural similarities to thyroid hormones have increased recently, but the health effects for thyroid hormones have not been well studied. The study aimed to determine PBDE levels in cord blood and further to explore associations between prenatal PBDE exposures and thyroid hormones in cord blood. Fifty-four cord blood samples were collected after delivery. Cord-blood levels of BDE-15, 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183 were analyzed using a high resolution gas chromatograph with a high resolution mass spectrometer. Thyroid hormones were determined by an automated chemiluminescence analyzer. The mean, median, and standard deviation of ΣPBDEs were 4.72, 3.49, and 6.36 ng/g lipid, respectively. To adjust for confounding by maternal age, pre-pregnant BMI and gestational age, stepwise multiple linear regression was used after log(2) transformation of the exposure variables. A doubling of BDE-154 was associated with 0.043 ng/mL lower triiodothyronine (T3) values (adjusted r=-0.245, p=0.043). Likewise a doubling of BDE-153 was associated with 0.143 ng/mL lower free T3 (FT3) values and a doubling of BDE-183 with 0.084 ng/mL lower FT3 values (adjusted r=-0.487, p=0.023). In contrast, the T4 (thyroxine)/T3 ratio increased by 4.93 (adjusted r=0.277, p=0.017) when doubling BDE-100 exposure. No significant associations with BDE-47 or any other of the PBDEs was found. Our findings of an inverse relationship between BDE-153, BDE-154 or BDE-184 and thyroid hormones confirm the results of animal experiments but are in contrast to most epidemiological studies.
3030592	Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) have been shown to affect the immune system of exposed Michigan farm workers and their families. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of PBB on the function and on the synthesis of immunoglobulins by peripheral blood lymphocytes. Concentrations of PBB as low as 0.001 microgram/10(5) cells decreased lymphocyte response to pokeweed mitogen; higher concentrations of PBB stimulated the in vitro synthesis and release of immunoglobulins. PBB had no effect on the quantity of E-rosette-forming cells, the total T or B cells, or the ratio of helper to suppressor T-cell subpopulations. Enhanced release of IgG was identified in lymphocyte cultures obtained from blood specimens of PBB-exposed Michigan farmers. The data from this study suggest that PBB exerted an adverse effect on cell function, but produced a nonspecific activation of B lymphocytes.
17710387	The Certificate of Analysis for SRM 1589a PCBs, Pesticides, PBDEs, and Dioxins/Furans in Human Serum has been updated to include certified concentration values for 27 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, three chlorinated pesticides, and four polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners as well as reference concentration values for 27 additional PCB congeners, six additional chlorinated pesticides, three additional PBDE congeners, and selected polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). This represents an addition of concentration values for 29 PCB congeners and for PBDE congeners that were not quantified in the previous issue of SRM 1589a. With the increased number of certified and reference concentration values for PCBs and the inclusion of certified and reference concentration values for PBDEs, this serum material will be more useful as a reference material for contaminant monitoring in human tissues and fluids.
22707201	In the present study, 40 juvenile crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were caught from a river close to an electronic waste (e-waste) site (exposed group) and another located 80 km away from the e-waste site (control group) in Zhejiang, China. Results indicated that muscle levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (median PBDEs, 235.98 ng/g wet wt; range, 7.70-703.31 ng/g wet wt), serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (median TSH, 2.32 µIU/ml; range, 2.05-2.72 µIU/ml) and erythrocyte DNA damage level (median Olive tail movement, 16.27 µm; range, 4.28-27.51 µm) were higher in the exposed group than those in the control group (0.56 ng/g wet wt, range, 0.34-1.24 ng/g wet wt, p < 0.01; 1.70 µIU/ml, range, 1.40-2.08 µIU/ ml, p < 0.01; 6.06 µm, range, 2.01-10.72 µm, p < 0.01, respectively). Thyroxine (T4) was significantly lower in the exposed group (8.97 µIU/ml) than in the control group (12.47 µIU/ml). In addition, thyroid endocrine disorder and erythrocyte DNA damage levels were significantly associated with polybrominated diphenyl ether exposure. Hence, PBDEs may affect wild fish populations in real ecosystems with thyroid endocrine disruption and DNA damage.
22668079	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of flame retardants historically used in textiles, furniture, and electronic products. Recent studies have documented widespread PBDE exposure to humans, with higher levels measured in children than adults. We analyzed 10 tri- to hepta-BDE congener levels in blood collected from 7-year old Mexican-American children living in an agriculture community in California (n = 272). The most frequently detected PBDE congeners in child serum were BDE-47, -99, -100, and -153, all of which were measured in >99% of the children. We used multiple linear regression models to examine associations between child total PBDE levels (ng/g lipid) and determinants of exposure. Factors positively associated with higher PBDE levels in the children were total PBDE levels in maternal serum during pregnancy, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and having no safe places to play in their neighborhood. Child BMI was inversely associated with serum PBDE levels (regression p-values <0.05). Our findings confirm that exposure to the penta-BDE mixture is ongoing, and that Mexican-American children living in California may be experiencing higher PBDE exposure from their environment compared to children sampled from the general U.S. population. Additional research is needed to assess the health impacts of these exposures.
21255843	BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding the persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transport, and adverse health effects of polybrominated dipheyl ethers (PBDEs) have recently come to light. PBDEs may potentially be of concern to indigenous (First Nations) people of Canada who subsist on traditional foods, but there is a paucity of information on this topic. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To investigate whether the traditional diet is a major source of PBDEs in sub-Arctic First Nations populations of the Hudson Bay Lowlands (James and Hudson Bay),Ontario, Canada, a variety of tissues from wild game and fish were analyzed for PBDE content (n=147) and dietary exposure assessed and compared to the US EPA reference doses (RfDs). In addition, to examine the effect of isolation/industrialization on PBDE body burdens, the blood plasma from three First Nations (Cree Nation of Oujé-Bougoumou, Quebec; Fort Albany First Nation, Ontario; and Weenusk First Nation [Peawanuck], Ontario, Canada) were collected (n=54) and analyzed using a log-linear contingency model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The mean values of PBDEs in wild meats and fish adjusted for standard consumption values and body weight, did not exceed the US EPA RfD. Log linear modeling of the human PBDE body burden showed that PBDE body burden increases as access to manufactured goods increases. Thus, household dust from material goods containing PBDEs is likely responsible for the human exposure; the traditional First Nations diet appears to be a minor source of PBDEs. 
17993135	Median concentration of total PBDEs in maternal serum, paternal serum, umbilical cord serum, and breast milk samples were 12, 12, 17, and 6.1 ng/g lipid weight (lw) in Vallecas and 9.7, 12, 15, and 5.5 ng/g lw in Getafe. The median value found in placentas was 1.9 ng/g lw (in Vallecas). BDE 47 was the predominant congener in serum samples (maternal, paternal, and umbilical cord), while BDE 209 was predominant in placenta and breast milk samples. BDEs 196 and 197 were detected in most of the placenta and breast milk samples. The results show that PBDEs, like other POPs, can cross the placenta barrier, although the speed of the process seems to differ for each PBDE congeners. The total PBDE concentrations found in this study are consistent with research reported elsewhere. They are in the same range as those recently reported by other European and Asian studies and lower than those conducted in the U.S.A. No significant differences were found (p > 0.05) between regions, sexes, and ages, while statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between maternal serum, umbilical cord serum, and breast milk samples. The presence of PBDEs in cord blood and placenta samples indicates that there is prenatal exposure of PBDEs, which could continue after birth via breast milk.
11294977	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), used as flame retardants, are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. PBDEs act as endocrine disruptors via alterations in thyroid hormone homeostasis. We examined thyroid hormone concentrations and hepatic enzyme activity in weanling rats exposed to three commercial PBDE mixtures: DE-71, DE-79, and DE-83R. Female Long-Evans rats, 28 days old, were orally administered various doses of DE-71, DE-79, or DE-83R for 4 days. Serum and liver samples were collected 24 h after the last dose and analyzed for serum total thyroxine (T(4)), triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), hepatic microsomal ethoxy- and pentoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase (EROD and PROD), and uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activities. The PBDE-treated groups did not exhibit significant changes in body weight; however, increased liver weights, as well as 10- to 20-fold induction in EROD and 30- to 40-fold induction in PROD were found in the DE-71-- and DE-79--treated animals. DE-71 and DE-79 caused dose-dependent depletion of T(4), accompanied by up to 3- to 4-fold induction in UDPGT activities. Serum total T(4) was decreased a maximum of 80% for DE-71 and 70% for DE-79 in the highest dose, with benchmark doses (BMDs) of approximately 12.74 mg/kg/day for DE-71 and 9.25 mg/kg/day for DE-79. Dose-related effects in serum T(3) levels were less apparent, with maximal reductions of 25-30% at the highest dose for both DE-71 and DE-79. The two mixtures showed no effect on serum TSH levels. Benchmark dose analysis revealed that the two mixtures were comparable in altering thyroid hormone levels and hepatic enzyme activity. DE-83R was not effective in altering any of the measured parameters. The present study suggests that short-term exposure to some commercial PBDE mixtures interferes with the thyroid hormone system via upregulation of UDPGTS:
23498664	Increased levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) can occur particularly in dust and soil surrounding facilities that recycle products containing PBDEs. This may be the source of increased exposure for nearby workers and residents. To investigate, we measured PBDE levels in soil, office dust and blood of workers at the closest workplace (i.e. within 100m) to a large automotive shredding and metal recycling facility in Brisbane, Australia. The workplace investigated in this study was independent of the automotive shredding facility and was one of approximately 50 businesses of varying types within a relatively large commercial/industrial area surrounding the recycling facility. Concentrations of PBDEs in soils were at least an order of magnitude greater than background levels in the area. Congener profiles were dominated by larger molecular weight congeners; in particular BDE-209. This reflected the profile in outdoor air samples previously collected at this site. Biomonitoring data from blood serum indicated no differential exposure for workers near the recycling facility compared to a reference group of office workers, also in Brisbane. Unlike air, indoor dust and soil sample profiles, serum samples from both worker groups were dominated by congeners BDE-47, BDE-153, BDE-99, BDE-100 and BDE-183 and was similar to the profile previously reported in the general Australian population. Estimated exposures for workers near the industrial point source suggested indoor workers had significantly higher exposure than outdoor workers due to their exposure to indoor dust rather than soil. However, no relationship was observed between blood PBDE levels and different roles and activity patterns of workers on-site. These comparisons of PBDE levels in serum provide additional insight into the inter-individual variability within Australia. Results also indicate congener patterns in the workplace environment did not match blood profiles of workers. This was attributed to the relatively high background exposures for the general Australian population via dietary intake and the home environment.
22763040	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. OBJECTIVES: We used handwipes to estimate exposure to PBDEs in house dust among toddlers and examined sex, age, breast-feeding, race, and parents' education as predictors of serum PBDEs. METHODS: Eighty-three children from 12 to 36 months of age were enrolled in North Carolina between May 2009 and November 2010. Blood, handwipe, and house dust samples were collected and analyzed for PBDEs. A questionnaire was administered to collect demographic data. RESULTS: PBDEs were detected in all serum samples (geometric mean for ΣpentaBDE in serum was 43.3 ng/g lipid), 98% of the handwipe samples, and 100% of the dust samples. Serum ΣpentaBDEs were significantly correlated with both handwipe and house dust ΣpentaBDE levels, but were more strongly associated with handwipe levels (r = 0.57; p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.35; p < 0.01). Multivariate model estimates revealed that handwipe levels, child's sex, child's age, and father's education accounted for 39% of the variation in serum ΣBDE3 levels (sum of BDEs 47, 99, and 100). In contrast, age, handwipe levels, and breast-feeding duration explained 39% of the variation in serum BDE 153. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that hand-to-mouth activity may be a significant source of exposure to PBDEs. Furthermore, age, socioeconomic status, and breast-feeding were significant predictors of exposure, but associations varied by congener. Specifically, serum ΣBDE3 was inversely associated with socioeconomic status, whereas serum BDE-153 was positively associated with duration of breast-feeding and mother's education. 
21663933	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), widely used as flame retardants in commercial products, have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Although adult human exposure to PBDEs is well documented, developmental exposure is less well characterized. The objectives of this study were to measure maternal and fetal exposure to nine PBDE congeners and to investigate potential associations with birth weight. PBDE congeners were quantified in maternal serum at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy, delivery, and umbilical cord serum (UCS) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). Complete blood sample sets were obtained from 97 pregnant women (mean age 33.1±0.5 years). PBDE-28, -47 and -99 were quantified in all samples tested and PBDE-47 was the most abundant congener measured in both maternal (mid-pregnancy and delivery samples geometric mean=26.9 and 26.9, respectively) and UCS (GM=56.0 ng g(-1) lipid). The UCS concentration for all congeners with the exception of PBDE-153 was higher vs. maternal delivery samples (p<0.001). Only the UCS concentration of PBDE-17 and -99 were significantly associated (β=-49.860, p=0.032, and β=-3.645, p=0.05) with birth weight. However, after adjustment for potential confounders only the association between PBDE-99 and birth weight remained significant (β=-3.951 and p=0.016). We conclude that: the fetus is exposed to PBDEs from at least the second trimester of pregnancy onward; PBDE congeners are higher in UCS compared to maternal serum samples collected at delivery; and that developmental PBDE exposure is potentially associated with lower birth weight.
21737118	Thyroid hormones, which influence body metabolism and development, could be affected by persistent organic pollutants. We sought to examine the relationship between polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and thyroid disease. We employed incidence density sampling to perform a nested case control analysis of the Michigan Long-Term PBB Cohort. Cohort members (n=3333) were exposed to PBBs through contaminated cattle feed in 1973-1974 and to PCBs through daily life. Those with detectable serum PBB and PCB concentrations at enrollment were categorized into tertiles of PBB and PCB exposure. Case-patients were cohort members answering "Yes" to "Has a healthcare provider ever told you that you had a thyroid problem?" during follow-up interviews; control-patients were cohort members answering "No". We used odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare odds of thyroid disease by PBB and PCB exposure and by various risk factors. Total cumulative thyroid disease incidence after 33 years was 13.9% among women and 2.6% among men. After adjusting for body mass index, we found no statistically significant differences in odds of any type of thyroid disease among women or men with elevated PBB or PCB exposure. Compared to control-patients, women with thyroid disease had increased odds of being overweight/obese (OR=2.82, 95% CI: 1.94-4.11) and developing infertility (OR=1.71, 95% CI: 1.08-2.69), diabetes (OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.04-2.51), or arthritis (OR=1.71, 95% CI: 1.18-2.50) during follow-up. Additional research should explore potential associations between PBBs/PCBs and thyroid disease among children exposed in utero.
19165393	BACKGROUND: A previous study from our laboratory showed that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were metabolized to hydroxylated PBDEs (HO-PBDEs) in mice and that para-HO-PBDEs were the most abundant and, potentially, the most toxic metabolites. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the concentrations of HO-PBDEs in blood from pregnant women, who had not been intentionally or occupationally exposed to these flame retardants, and from their newborn babies. METHODS: Twenty human blood samples were obtained from a hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, and analyzed for both PBDEs and HO-PBDEs using electron-capture negative-ionization gas chromatographic mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The metabolite pattern of HO-PBDEs in human blood was quite different from that found in mice; 5-HO-BDE-47 and 6-HO-BDE-47 were the most abundant metabolites of BDE-47, and 5'-HO-BDE-99 and 6'-HO-BDE-99 were the most abundant metabolites of BDE-99. The relative concentrations between precursor and corresponding metabolites indicated that BDE-99 was more likely to be metabolized than BDE-47 and BDE-100. In addition, three bromophenols were also detected as products of the cleavage of the diphenyl ether bond. The ratio of total hydroxylated metabolites relative to their PBDE precursors ranged from 0.10 to 2.8, indicating that hydroxylated metabolites of PBDEs were accumulated in human blood. CONCLUSIONS: The quite different PBDE metabolite pattern observed in humans versus mice indicates that different enzymes might be involved in the metabolic process. Although the levels of HO-PBDE metabolites found in human blood were low, these metabolites seemed to be accumulating. 
22345314	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widespread environmental contaminants found in seafood and dairy products. PCBs and PBDEs are structurally similar chemicals and affect thyroid hormone function and behavior in children and laboratory rodents. Although coexposure frequently exists, the in vivo developmental effects of combined exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on thyroxine (T4) levels are unknown. We examined the effects of PCB and PBDE coexposure from gestational day 6 through postnatal day (p) 21, alone and in combination, on T4 levels in rat offspring. In males, exposure to PCBs and PBDEs at 1.7, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μmol/kg/day induced equivalent and dose-dependent reductions in T4 from p 7 to p 21. Exposure to equimolar mixtures of PCBs and PBDEs at 3.4, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/kg/day additively reduced T4 from p 7 to p 21 in males. In a second series of experiments, we determined sex effects on the mixture exposures and found that coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs had similar additive effects on T4 levels in male and female offspring. This study demonstrates that equimolar exposure to PCBs and PBDEs induces similar reductions in T4 levels and that coexposure to a mixture of PCBs and PBDEs has additive effects on T4 levels. These thyroid hormone effects of coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs are important when considering the cumulative effects of coexposure to multiple environmental thyroid hormone-disrupting agents in risk assessment for developmental disorders.
22125915	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) as ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants have attracted much attention in recent years. Exposure to PBDEs could induce a high health risk for children. The aim of this study was to investigate the PBDEs exposure of children (9-12 years) from Taizhou, China. Fifty-eight blood samples were collected in one school in a mountainous area in Taizhou. The concentrations of sigma9PBDEs (sum of BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -183, -197 and -209) ranged from 2.66 to 33.9 ng/g lipid wet (lw) with a median of 7.22 ng/g lw. These concentrations were lower than those of children in USA, but close to European and Asian general population levels. The results showed that children in Taizhou countryside were at a low level of PBDEs exposure. The predominant congener was BDE-209, followed by BDE-28, -47, -197 and -153. High abundance of BDE-209 was consistent with the pollution background of PBDEs in China characterized by high brominated congeners as main pollutants.
11999794	This study investigates exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), which are used as flame retardants in electronic equipment, in a group of technicians with intense computer work. Thirteen PBDE congeners and TBBPA were quantified in serum from 19 computer technicians. Previously investigated groups of hospital cleaners with no computer experience, and clerks working full-time at computer screens were used for comparison. The computer technicians had serum concentrations of BDE-153, BDE-183 and BDE-209 that were five times higher than those reported among hospital cleaners and computer clerks. The median levels observed among the computer technicians were 4.1, 1.3, and 1.6 pmol/g lipid weight, respectively. In contrast, for BDE-47 there was no difference between the computer technicians and the others. BDE-100, BDE-203, and three structurally unidentified octa-BDEs and three nona-BDEs, were present in almost all samples from the computer technicians. Further, TBBPA was detected in 8 out of 10 samples. The levels of BDE-153, BDE-183, and one of the octa-BDEs were positively correlated with duration of computer work among technicians. On a group level an exposure gradient was observed, from the least exposed cleaners to the clerks, and to the highest exposed group of computer technicians. A dose (duration of computer work)-response relationship among computer technicians was demonstrated for some higher brominated PBDE congeners. Thus, it is evident that PBDEs used in computers and electronics, including the fully brominated BDE-209, contaminate the work environment and accumulate in the workers tissues.
16530311	In the present study, concentrations and tissue distribution of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs; IUPAC # 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, and 209) were examined in brain, adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and serum of birds of prey. Median SigmaPBDE levels (BDE 28-183) in the tissues of sparrowhawks ranged from 360 to 1900 ng/g lipid weight (lw), which was in general one order of magnitude higher than in the tissues of common buzzards (26-130 ng/g lw). There were no differences in PBDE congener patterns between the various tissues within individuals of a certain species. Inter-species differences in PBDE patterns and in particular the percentage of BDE 99, 100 and 153 were, however, pronounced between sparrowhawk and common buzzard. BDE 209 was detected in nearly all serum and in some liver samples, but not in any other tissues. This observation suggests that exposure to BDE 209 is low or that this congener is poorly accumulated. Passive (lipid content related) diffusion could not completely describe the PBDE tissue distribution, e.g. the lowest PBDE-load was measured in brain, a fairly lipid rich tissue.
17035146	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a major class of flame retardants, are ubiquitous environmental contaminants with particularly high concentrations in humans from the United States. This study is a first attempt to report and compare PBDE concentrations in blood drawn from a family. Serum samples from family members collected at two sampling occasions 90 days apart were analyzed for PBDE congeners. Concentrations of the lower-brominated PBDEs were similar at the two sampling times for each family member, with children's levels 2- to 5-fold higher than those of their parents. Concentrations of, for example, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) varied from 32 ng/g lipid weight (lw) in the father to 60, 137, and 245 ng/g lw in the mother, child, and toddler, respectively. Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) concentrations differed significantly between the two samplings. September concentrations in the father, mother, child, and toddler were 23, 14, 143, and 233 ng/g lw, respectively. December concentrations (duplicate results from the laboratory) were 2 and 3, 4 and 4, 9 and 12, and 19 and 26 ng/g lw, respectively. Parents' summation operatorPBDE concentrations approached U.S. median concentrations, with children's concentrations near the maximum (top 5%) found in U.S. adults. The youngest child had the highest concentrations of all PBDE congeners, suggesting that younger children are more exposed to PBDEs than are adults. Our estimates indicate that house dust contributes to children's higher PBDE levels. BDE-209 levels for all family members were 10-fold lower at the second sampling. The short half-life of BDE-209 (15 days) indicates that BDE-209 levels can decrease rapidly in response to decreased exposures. This case study suggests that children are at higher risk for PBDE exposures and, accordingly, face higher risks of PBDE-related health effects than adults.
23708622	Sensitive and reliable methods for simultaneous determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in limited volumes of human serum or plasma need to be further documented especially when they accumulate at low levels that are still capable of disrupting endocrine and immune functions, and affecting neurodevelopment and reproduction. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a sensitive and quantitative method that simultaneously quantifies PBDEs and PCBs in 0.5 ml of human serum or plasma. We optimized a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method and used silica particle purification for the extraction of PBDEs and PCBs. Two multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) transitions were optimized for each congener. The sum of the transitions was used for quantification, and their abundance ratios were used for identification. The combined method optimization techniques resulted in limits of detection from 3 to 145 pg/ml for 10 PBDEs and 1-12 pg/ml for 15 PCBs. Method was solidly validated by analyzing serum fortified with a certified PBDE and PCB standard mixture from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The accuracy was 88-118% and day-to-day precision was within 19%. The method was successfully applied to quantify native concentrations of PBDE and PCB in commercially available human serum. The sensitivity and selectivity of the GC/EI-MS/MS analysis enables it to be the method of choice for investigations of exposures to PBDE and PCB congeners, especially when sample volume is limited.
20346480	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate congener-specific body burden levels and possible determinants of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the Japanese human population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 72 participants aged 15-74 years; subjects were not occupationally exposed to PBDEs or dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs). Participants lived in two urban areas and two fishing villages. Twenty-seven PBDE congeners, PCB-126, PCB-118, PCB-156, and biochemical factors were determined in fasting blood. A questionnaire survey on life-style was also conducted. RESULTS: More than half of the PBDE values for 14 congeners were below the levels of detection (LODs). The median concentration of total PBDEs was 3.6 ng g(-1) lipid. The most abundant congener was BDE-209 (median concentration, 0.90 ng g(-1) lipid), followed by BDE-153, BDE-207, and BDE-47 in the given order. Most PBDE congeners with < or = 6 bromine atoms had significant positive associations with the concentrations of the three DL-PCBs (suggesting common routes of exposure) and with plasma concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), biological markers of fish intake. These associations did not change substantially after adjustment for age, sex, and log(body mass index). These positive associations with the concentrations of DL-PCBs or EPA/DHA were not found in analyses of high-brominated PBDE congeners with > or = 8 bromine atoms. CONCLUSIONS: Fish consumption may be a major contributor to the accumulation of PBDE congeners with 6 bromine atoms among the general Japanese population. In contrast, the main exposure routes to high-brominated PBDEs in humans are probably not associated with fish consumption. 
17426733	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs, are a class of brominated flame retardants that, like other persistent organic pollutants (POPs), have been found in humans, wildlife, and biota worldwide. Unlike other POPs, however, the key routes of human exposure are not thought to be food and fish, but rather are from their use in household consumer products, and to the high levels of PBDEs found in house dust. The exposure of Americans to PBDEs was systematically evaluated in this study. First, exposure media data on PBDE congeners were compiled. Then, an adult intake dose was derived using exposure factors in combination with these data. The exposure pathways evaluated included food and water ingestion, inhalation, and ingestion and dermal contact to house dust. These intakes were converted to a body burden using a simple pharmacokinetic (PK) model. The predicted body burdens were compared with representative profiles of PBDEs in blood and milk. The adult intake dose of total PBDEs was estimated to be 7.7 ng/kg body weight/day, and children's estimated intakes were higher at 49.3 ng/kg/day for ages 1-5, 14.4 ng/kg/day for 6-11, and 9.1 ng/kg/day for 12-19. The much higher dose for the child age 1-5 was due to the doubling of dust ingestion from 50 to 100 mg/day. The predicted adult body burden of total PBDEs was 33.8 ng/kg lipid weight (lwt), compared to representative measurements in blood and milk at 64.0 and 93.7 ng/g lwt, respectively Most of this apparent underprediction in total concentration was due to an underprediction of the key congener, BDE 47. The value for BDE 47 half-life in the body was identified as the variable most likely in error in this exercise. Other congener predictions compared well with measurements, suggesting general validity with the approach. An important finding from this assessment is that the food intake estimate of about 1.3 ng/kg/day (of the 7.7 ng/kg/day total) cannot explain current US body burdens; exposures to PBDEs in house dust accounted for 82% of the overall estimated intakes.
12380070	The levels of individual PBDE congeners were investigated in the invertebrate species whelk (Buccinum undatum), seastar (Asterias rubens), and hermit crab (Pagurus bernhardus), the gadoid fish species whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and cod (Gadus morhua), and the marine mammal species harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). These species are all important representatives of different trophic levels of the North Sea food web. All six major PBDE congeners detected (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154) are most prevalent in the commercial Penta-BDE formulation. There is no evidence for the occurrence of the Octa-BDE formulation in the North Sea food web, since its dominant congener, BDE183, was never detected. BDE209, the main congener (> 97%) in the Deca-BDE formulation, was detected only in a minority of the samples and always in concentrations around the limit of detection. Since BDE209 is often the major BDE congener in sediments from the area, the main reason for its low concentrations in biota from the North Sea seems to be a relatively low bioaccumulation potential. This can either be due to a low uptake rate of the very large molecule or a relatively rapid excretion after biotransformation. Since all invertebrates investigated are sentinel species, they are highly representative for the area of capture. The highest lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs in the invertebrates occurred near the mouth of the river Tees at the East coast of the UK. The geographical distribution of the PBDEs can be explained by the residual currents in the area. The direction of these currents differs between the summer and the winter season as a result of the presence or absence of vertical summer stratification of the deeper waters north of the Dogger Bank. Summer stratification results in the development of a density-driven bottom water current formed after the onset of vertical stratification of the water column in May leaving the UK coast near Flamborough Head toward the Dogger Bank. In winter, the residual currents run in a more southerly direction and follow the UK coastline. The distribution pattern of the PCBs and p,p'-DDE in the invertebrates was entirely different from that of the PBDEs, which could be expected, since the use of these organochlorines in western Europe peaked in the 1960s and 1970s but has been forbidden more than two decades ago, whereas the production and use of the penta-BDE formulation is of a more recent origin. The higher trophic levels of the North Sea food web were represented by the predatory gadoid fish species whiting and cod and the marine mammal species harbor seal and harbor porpoise. The lipid-normalized levels of the six major PBDE congeners in fish were similar to the levels in the invertebrates, but a biomagnification step in concentrations of generally more than an order of magnitude occurred from gadoid fish to marine mammals. Based on the limited number of samples, no differences could be observed between harbor seal and harbor porpoise. In summary, the results in three species of sentinel invertebrates from a network of stations covering a major part of the North Sea basin showed that the estuary of the river Tees at the UK East coast is a major source for tri- to hexa-PBDEs. Throughout the food-chain, the most marked increase in (lipid-normalized) levels of all six PBDE congeners occurred from predatory (gadoid) fish to marine mammals, agreeing with the transition from gill-breathing to lung-breathing animals. This has serious consequences for the route of elimination of POPs, since their elimination from the blood into the ambient seawater via the gill-membrane is no longer possible.
17396645	This study was designed to determine the body burden of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) among first-time mothers in the Greater Boston, Massachusetts area and to explore key routes of exposure. We collected breast milk samples from 46 first-time mothers, 2-8 weeks after birth. We also sampled house dust from the homes of a subset of participants by vacuuming commonly used areas. Data on personal characteristics, diet, home furniture, and electrical devices were gathered from each participant using a questionnaire. Breast milk and dust samples were analyzed for PBDEs using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. PBDE concentrations were log-normally distributed in breast milk and dust. We found statistically significant, positive associations between PBDE concentrations in breast milk and house dust (r = 0.76, p = 0.003, not including BDE-209), as well as with reported dietary habits, particularly the consumption of dairy products (r = 0.41, p = 0.005) and meat (r = 0.37, p = 0.01). Due to low detection rates, it was not possible to draw conclusions about the association between BDE-209 in milk and dust. Our results support the hypothesis that the indoor environment and diet both play prominent roles in adult human exposure to PBDEs.
22105974	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are brominated flame retardants that act as endocrine disruptors, affecting thyroid hormone homeostasis. As a follow-up to a recent study showing high PBDE levels in household cats and linking PBDE levels with cat hyperthyroidism, we measured PBDEs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) in serum samples from 26 California household cats (16 hyperthyroid, 10 controls) using liquid-liquid extraction and high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the present pilot study, we found that PBDE levels in California house cats were extremely high (ΣPBDEs median = 2,904 ng/g lipid; range, 631-22,537 ng/g lipid). This is approximately 50 times higher than levels in California residents (ΣPBDEs geomean = 62 ± 8.9 ng/g lipid, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), who have among the highest human levels in the world. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers congener patterns (BDE-99 major congener, BDE-209 significant) differed markedly from patterns found in California residents (BDE-47 major) or wildlife but resembled patterns found in house dust. Polychlorinated biphenyls and OCPs in cats were highly correlated, consistent with a shared dietary source or pathway of exposure, but did not correlate with PBDEs. This suggests a different source or pathway of exposure for PBDEs, which was most likely house dust. The authors found no evidence that linked levels of PBDEs, PCBs, or OCPs with hyperthyroidism. This may be because of the small sample size, competing or confounding risk factors, or complicated causal mechanisms.
19178930	The breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs; sum of eight congeners: BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209) were determined (by high resolution gas chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometry) in samples from primiparous women collected in 2006 in Tianjin, China. Dietary and lifestyle habits of the participants were obtained by questionnaires. The median total PBDE concentration (including BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) was 2500 pg g(-1) lipid weight, ranging from 1700 to 4500 pg g(-1) lipid weight. These levels were in the same range as those from Europe and Japan but much lower than those from North America. The congener profile in China was also different from other countries. The contribution of BDE-28 was around 15%, much higher than any other country, implying that a different Penta-BDE formulation might be used in the Chinese market. The lower ratio of the sum of BDE-47, 99, and 100 to the sum of BDE-153 and 154 suggested that Octa-products were in more demand in China. A significant correlation was found between a woman's PBDE concentration and the time she used electronic appliances (h/d). This implies that electronics are a potential source of PBDEs to people. Inhalation or ingestion of particulate matter (such as dust) may also be an important exposure pathway. There was no significant correlation between the PBDE concentration and the consumption of meat, fish, and milk. Further research is needed to determine the specific contribution of each exposure route and their health effects.
18599108	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used as flame retardants in foams, fabrics and plastics, and are common contaminants of household air and dust and bioaccumulate in wildlife, and are detectable in human tissues and in fish and animal food products. In the Great Lakes Basin sport fish consumption has been demonstrated to be an important source of PCB and DDE exposure. PBDEs are present in the same sport fish but prior to our study the contribution to human PBDE body burdens from Great Lakes sport fish consumption had not been investigated. This study was designed to assess PBDE, PCB and 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (DDE) serum concentrations in an existing cohort of 508 frequent and infrequent consumers of sport-caught fish living in five Great Lake states. BDE congeners 47 and 99 were identified in the majority of blood samples, 98% and 62% respectively. summation operatorPBDE levels were positively associated with age, hours spent outdoors, DDE, summation operatorPCB, years of sportfish consumption, and catfish and shellfish intake, and negatively associated with income and recent weight loss. Other dietary components collected were not predictive of measured summation operatorPBDE levels. In multivariate models, summation operatorPBDE levels were positively associated with age, years consuming sport fish, shellfish meals, and computer use and negatively associated with recent weight loss. Having summation operatorPBDE levels in the highest quintile was independently associated with older age, male gender, consumption of catfish and shellfish, computer use and spending less time indoors. summation operatorPCB and DDE were strongly associated suggesting common exposure routes. The association between summation operatorPBDE and summation operatorPCB or DDE was much weaker and modeling suggested more diverse PBDE sources with few identified multi-contaminant-shared exposure routes. In our cohort Great Lakes sport fish consumption does not contribute strongly to PBDE exposure.
231083	In the course of clinical examinations of individuals exposed to PBB (polybrominated biphenyl(s) in Michigan, employees of the chemical company which manufactured PBB also were examined. Analysis of serum and adipose tissue from these workers revealed quantitative and qualitative differences, compared with farm residents exposed to PBB. Serum and fat concentrations of PBB were higher among chemical workers, and the concentrations of PBB homologs were also higher, attributable to different intensity, route (skin, inhalation, direct ingestion vs. ingestion of animal foodstuffs), and composition (unchanged vs. animal-mediated material) of exposure in chemical workers vs. farmers. The unusual nature of occupational exposure was further evident in measurement of serum and fat DDE and identification of serum tetrabromobenzene (TBB). DDE concentrations were higher among employees than among farmers, consistent with the workers' earlier occupational exposure to DDT, which had been produced by the company. Serum TBB was not explicable by direct exposure to the chemical, but has been ascribed to exposure to hexabromobenzene, which was shown to give tetrabromobenzene as a metabolite in the rat.
19897300	The aim of the present study is to determine whether levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in breast milk in the general population are associated with demographic parameters, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and occupational exposure. Forty-six participants are randomly selected from healthy women recruited between April 2007 and April 2008 from local hospitals in southern Taiwan. Thirty PBDE isomers in breast milk are analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a high resolution mass spectrometer. The mean+/-standard deviation of Sigma PBDEs in breast milk is 3.59+/-1.07 ng/g lipid. Our current value of Sigma PBDEs in breast milk is 0.7-fold lower compared to the past value in our previous study between 2000 and 2001. Higher levels of Sigma PBDEs might be significantly associated with older maternal age and maternal age of the present study is between 22 and 42 years old. Levels of Sigma PBDEs and certain PBDEs in breast milk are not correlated with maternal pre-pregnant BMI (Body mass index), parity, and lipid contents of breast milk. The Sigma PBDEs level in breast milk is lower in more educated women after controlling for age and pre-pregnancy BMI in our subjects. The main factors associated with Sigma PBDEs in breast milk are age and education level among the binary variables of demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics in this report. The exploratory relationships are found between PBDEs in breast milk and age, education level, or occupational exposure due to small sampling size.
19682725	The levels and congener patterns of PBDEs were investigated in human placental samples in Denmark. The median concentrations of sigmaPBDE(tri-hepta) and BDE-209 in the 50 samples were 1.22 and 1.14 ng g(-1) lw, respectively, with the total sum ranging from 0.51 to 17.1 ng g(-1) lw, which is similar to previous placental studies. The PBDE content in placental tissue was dominated by BDE-209, which accounted for approximately 50% of the total amount of PBDEs. BDE-47, -99, and -153 were detected in all samples. Approximately equal amounts of BDE-47 and BDE-153 were observed in the placental tissue, which is in agreement with previous European studies of human serum. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to analyze congener patterns within and between mothers. The loading plot showed groupings of the measured PBDE variables in three groups, representative of Penta-, Octa- and Deca-BDE technical mixtures. Congeners representing the individual technical mixtures were close to orthogonal or inversely correlated, indicating variation in the congener patterns of internal exposure corresponding to the patterns of technical mixtures used in products. Visualisation of the participant objects according to body mass index (BMI), revealed inherent congener patterns (19% X-variance) showing increased frequency for participants within the highest BMI group to have elevated concentrations of BDE-209 in the placental tissue.
20447676	The subacute toxicity of a commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) preparation, Bromkal 70-5DE, was investigated. In addition to a vehicle control, the mixture was given orally to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats for 28 d at three dose levels; 2.5, 25 and 250 mg kg(-1) b.w.d(-1). The observed effects include increased hepatic EROD activity (from 2.5 mg kg(-1)d(-1)); increased liver weight (males), increased PROD activity and depletion of hepatic retinoids (from 25 mg kg(-1)d(-1)); and increased liver weight (females), marked histological changes in the liver and lungs, as well as increased serum parameters such as total protein, cholesterol and albumin (from 250 mg kg(-1)d(-1)). Chemical analysis of the PBDE mixture with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) showed impurities of polybrominated dibenzofurans and to a lesser extent dibenzodioxins, in total levels of about 7.0 microg g(-1) of Bromkal technical mixture. The animals were thereby exposed to an estimated dose of dioxin-like equivalents corresponding to 1.3-131 ng TEQ kg(-1) b.w.d(-1). It cannot be ruled out that this level of impurities can explain the hepatic EROD induction and hepatic retinoid depletion, which are considered typical markers of toxicity mediated via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).
19931910	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are potential persistent organic pollutants which have raised many concerns in recent years. Research focusing on children exposure to PBDEs is important but insufficient. The levels and patterns of PBDEs in children's plasma from Dalian, China were studied for the first time. Seventeen PBDE congeners (BDE-30, 28, 35, 37, 75, 47, 66, 100, 99, 116, 155, 154, 153, 183, 181, 190 and 209) in 29 plasma samples were measured. Median PBDE concentration was 31.61 ng g(-1) lipid. BDE-153 was the dominant congener, followed by BDE-99, 47, and 183. High abundance of BDE-183 suggested a higher Octa-BDE use in China. No significant differences were observed between males and females or among different age groups. The levels of PBDEs in children's plasma in the present study were 9-30 times higher than those in non-occupational exposure people from Guangzhou, South China and those in human milk of general adults from other cities of China, but were at the moderate levels of those in children around the world. These results indicate that children in Dalian are at a high risk of exposure to PBDEs.
19682390	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), a brominated flame retardant, was accidently mixed into animal feed in Michigan (1973-1974) resulting in human exposure through consumption of contaminated meat, milk and eggs. Beginning in 1976 individuals who consumed contaminated products were enrolled in the Michigan Long-Term PBB Study. This cohort presents a unique opportunity to study the association between parental exposures to PBB and offspring sex ratio. METHODS: We identified offspring of female PBB cohort participants (born 1975-1988) and obtained electronic birth records for those born in the state of Michigan. We linked this information to parental serum PBB and PCB concentrations collected at enrollment into the cohort. We modeled the odds of a male birth with generalized estimating equations accounting for the non-independence of siblings born to the same parents. We explored potential confounders: parental age and education at offspring's birth, parental body mass index at cohort enrollment, birth order, gestational age and year of offspring's birth. RESULTS: The overall proportion of male offspring among 865 live births to cohort mothers was 0.542. This was higher than the national male proportion of 0.514 (binomial test: p = 0.10). When both parents were in the cohort (n = 300), we found increased odds of a male birth with combined parents' enrollment PBB exposure > or = the median concentrations (3 microg/L for mothers; 6 microg/L for fathers) compared to combined parents' PBB exposure < the median concentrations (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.89-2.29), although this did not reach statistical significance. In addition, there was a suggestion of increased odds of a male birth for combined parents' enrollment PCB exposure > or = the median concentrations (6 microg/L for mothers; 8 microg/L for fathers) compared to combined parents' enrollment PCB exposure < the median concentrations (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 0.93-2.52). CONCLUSION: This study adds to the body of literature on secondary sex ratio and exposure to environmental contaminants. In this population, combined parental exposure to PBBs or PCBs increased the odds of a male birth. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings and shed light on the biological mechanisms by which these types of chemicals may influence the secondary sex ratio. 
17948778	Co-incident with the introduction of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) into household materials nearly 30 years ago, feline hyperthyroidism (FH) has increased dramatically. Risk of developing FH is associated with indoor living and consumption of canned catfood. We hypothesized that increases in FH were, in part, related to increased PBDE exposure, with key routes of exposure being diet and ingestion of house dust. This study was designed to determine whether body burdens of PBDEs in hyperthyroid (HT) cats were greater than that of young or sick non-HT cats. Serum samples and clinical information were collected from 23 cats. Serum and dry and canned cat food were analyzed for PBDEs. A spectrum of BDE congeners was detected in all cats, with BDE-47, 99, 207, and 209 predominating. Mean +/- standard error (and median) cumulative sigma PBDE serum concentrations of young, old non-HT, and HT cats were 4.3 +/- 1.5 (3.5), 10.5 +/- 3.5 (5.9), and 12.7 +/- 3.9 (6.2) ng/mL, respectively. Due to high variability within each group, no association was detected between HT cats and sigma PBDE levels. Indicative of age- or disease-dependent changes in PBDE metabolism, BDE-47/99 ratios were inversely correlated with age, and 47/99 and 100/ 99 ratios in HT cats were significantly lower than those in the other cats. Overall, sigma PBDE levels in cats were 20- to 100-fold greater than median levels in U.S. adults. Our results support the hypothesis that cats are highly exposed to PBDEs; hence, pet cats may serve as sentinels to better assess human exposure and adverse health outcomes related to low-level but chronic PBDE exposure.
21715243	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been widely used as flame retardants in consumer products and are ubiquitous in residential indoor air and dust. However, little is known about exposure in the office environment. OBJECTIVES: We examined relationships between PBDE concentrations in the office environment and internal exposure using concurrent measurements of PBDEs in serum, handwipes, and office dust. METHODS: We collected serum, dust, and handwipe samples from 31 participants who spent at least 20 hr/week in an office. We used a questionnaire to collect information about work and personal habits. RESULTS: We found positive associations between PBDEs in room dust, handwipes (a measure of personal exposure), and serum. PBDE office dust concentrations were weakly correlated with measurements in handwipes: r = 0.35 (p = 0.06) for pentaBDE (sum of BDE congeners 28/33, 47, 99, 100, and 153) and 0.33 (p = 0.07) for BDE-209. Hand washing also predicted pentaBDE levels in handwipes: low hand-washers had 3.3 times the pentaBDE levels in their handwipes than did high hand-washers (p = 0.02). PentaBDE in handwipes predicted pentaBDE levels in serum (p = 0.03): Serum concentrations in the highest handwipe tertile were on average 3.5 times the lowest handwipe tertile. The geometric mean concentration of pentaBDEs in serum was 27 ng/g lipid. We detected BDE-209 in 20% of serum samples, at levels ranging from < 4.8 to 9.7 ng/g lipid. CONCLUSION: Our research suggests that exposure to pentaBDE in the office environment contributes to pentaBDE body burden, with exposure likely linked to PBDE residues on hands. In addition, hand washing may decrease exposure to PBDEs. 
2992920	A review and summary is given of analytical, biochemical, and immunological studies made following an immunodiagnostic investigation which revealed significant decreases in the numbers, and changes in the functional integrity, of both T-and B-lymphocytes in a group of Michigan dairy farmers exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) which had been inadvertently introduced into the food chain in 1973. A quantification technique based on selected ion monitoring of bromine anions, obtained in negative chemical ionization, permitted determination of 10-35 pg of individual PBB congener per mL serum, a 20-fold improvement over electron capture gas chromatography. An in vitro spiked system was established and shown to be a representative model of environmentally contaminated blood. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric quantification determined that the distribution of PBB among plasma, erythrocytes, mononucleocytes and polymorphonucleocytes was 89:9:less than 1:less than 1. In plasma 80% of the PBB was bound to apolipoproteins B and A in a 3:1 ratio. No preferential absorption of PBB congeners was found in the blood compartments suggesting that changes in the relative abundances of PBB congeners observed in longitudinal studies on Michigan subjects reflect differences in excretion rates or metabolism. A repeat in 1981 of the immunodiagnostic tests conducted in 1976 revealed a virtually complete persistence of the immune dysfunctions in the Michigan farmers exposed to PBB a decade ago.
21030064	In order to assess potential risks of exposure to environmental chemicals, more information on concomitant exposure to different chemicals is needed. We present data on chemicals in human milk of a cohort study (2004, 2005, 2006) of 54 mother/child pairs, where for the first time, cosmetic UV filters, synthetic musks, parabens and phthalate metabolites were analyzed in the same sample along with persistent organochlor pollutants (POPs), i.e., organochlor pesticides and metabolites, polybrominated diphenylethers and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The two groups of chemicals exhibited different exposure patterns. Six out of seven PCB congeners and a majority of pesticides were present in all milk samples, with significant correlations between certain PCB congener and pesticide levels, whereas the cosmetic-derived compounds, UV filters, parabens and synthetic musks, exhibited a more variable exposure pattern with inter-individual differences. UV filters were present in 85.2% of milk samples, in the range of PCB levels. Comparison with a questionnaire revealed a significant correlation between use of products containing UV filters and their presence in milk for two frequently used and detected UV filters, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octocrylene, and for the whole group of UV filters. Concentrations of PCBs and organochlor pesticides were within ranges seen in Western and Southern European countries. For several POPs, mean and/or maximum daily intake calculated from individual concentrations was above recent US EPA reference dose values. Our data emphasize the need for analyses of complex mixtures to obtain more information on inter-individual and temporal variability of human exposure to different types of chemicals.
22619485	In the present study, we assessed the treatment effects of PBDE-209 administration on the immune function in rats during pregnancy and lactation. We harvested the blood and organs for flow cytometry, viability assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and histological evaluation. The results of this study were the PBDE-209 exposure during pregnancy and lactation impairs immune function in rats. The results may contribute to understanding the mechanism of PBDE-209 in immune function.
19772742	Stir-bar sorptive extraction and automated thermal desorption/cryotrapping interfaced to capillary gas chromatography and electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry is shown to effectively isolate and recover polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polybrominated biphenyls from sheep and human serum. This paper describes the development of the method and demonstrates the feasibility of using Twister with spiked serum. Conditions for conducting stir-bar sorptive extraction and for automated thermal desorption that led to acceptable analyte recoveries were optimized. The approach to sample preparation introduced here significantly reduces tedious labor and solvent consumption associated with conventional liquid-liquid extraction.
23416744	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) along with hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) and methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) were found in plant and soil samples collected surrounding a seafood processing factory and a seafood market in China. The profiles of MeO-PBDE congeners were different between seafood processing factory and seafood market. The detection frequency and concentration of 6-OH-BDE-47 were lower than that of MeO-PBDEs. Near seafood processing factory, a decreasing trend of analyte concentrations in plants was found downstream the river where factory wastewater was discharged. Concentrations of ΣMeO-PBDEs in plant and soil samples showed difference as root > soil > leaf. However, at seafood market, the concentrations of ΣMeO-PBDEs were much higher in leaves than those in soil. The concentration of ΣMeO-PBDEs in leaves showed a remarkable difference between Calystegia soldanella (Linn.) R. Br. and Setaira viridis (L.) Beauv.
16120752	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of additive flame retardants, are temporally increasing in wildlife tissues and capable of disrupting normal endocrine function. We determined whether in ovo and post-hatch exposure of captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) to environmentally relevant PBDEs alter thyroid, retinol, and oxidative stress measures. Control eggs were injected with safflower oil and subsequent nestlings fed the same vehicle; dosed eggs received PBDE congeners (BDE-47, -99, -100, -153), which mainly comprise the Penta-BDE commercial mixture, dissolved in safflower oil at concentrations (1500 ng/g total [Sigma] PBDEs) approximating those in Great Lakes gull eggs. Nestlings hatching from dosed eggs were orally exposed for 29 days to variable SigmaPBDE concentrations that are similar to levels reported in tissues of Great Lakes trout (100 ng/g). Treatment kestrels had lower plasma thyroxine (T(4)), plasma retinol, and hepatic retinol and retinyl palmitate concentrations, but unaltered triiodothyronine (T(3)) concentrations and thyroid glandular structure. BDE-47, -100, and -99 were negatively associated with plasma T(4), plasma retinol (BDE-100, -99) and hepatic retinol (BDE-47). Despite an antioxidant-rich diet, PBDE exposure induced hepatic oxidative stress, particularly in females, with an increased hepatic GSSG:GSH ratio, a marginal increase in lipid peroxidation, and increased oxidized glutathione. Positive associations were found between concentrations of BDE-183 and thiols and, in males, between BDE-99 and reduced GSH, but a negative association occurred between BDE-99 and TBARS. Subsequently, concentrations of PBDE congeners in wild birds may alter thyroid hormone and vitamin A concentrations, glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress.
232874	In 1973 PBB's were accidentally mixed into animal feed, resulting in marked toxic effects. Meat and dairy products were widely consumed in Michigan. To determine the impact of PBB's, 55 exposed Michigan farm residents, 11 Michigan chemical workers and 46 non-exposed Wisconsin farmers were examined. Abnormalities included decreased number of T-lymphocytes with concomitant increase of lymphocytes with no detectable surface markers, "null cells", and altered lymphocyte function. Data obtained from skin testing using standard recall antigens, showed no consistent correlation between the delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity response and the impaired lymphocyte function. PBB (hexa) in separated white blood cells and red cells was positively identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PBB and immunological abnormalities were not detected in non-exposed Wisconsin dairy farm residents.
21984658	Studies published in the last 3 decades have demonstrated global human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants. A growing body of literature suggests that PBDEs may disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis. Although thyroid hormones play an essential role in brain development, few studies have investigated relations between prenatal exposure to PBDEs and neonatal thyroid hormone levels, and none have measured thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in neonates. The authors measured 10 PBDE congeners in serum collected between October 1999 and October 2000 from 289 pregnant women living in California's Salinas Valley and abstracted TSH levels from their children's medical records. Individual PBDE congeners showed null or weak nonsignificant inverse relations with neonatal TSH. Total serum PBDE was not associated with neonatal TSH (β = 0.00, 95% confidence interval: -0.06, 0.06). Except for brominated diphenyl ether 153, a higher serum PBDE level was related to elevated odds of high TSH (≥80th percentile), but associations were not statistically significant. Associations were not modified by infant sex, age at TSH measurement, maternal serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentration, or mode of delivery. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. The authors found no conclusive evidence that prenatal exposure to PBDEs at levels similar to those of the general US population is related to neonatal TSH.
19544851	Human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) through food and indoor dust ingestion was assessed for 19 Belgian adults. The intake of PBDEs (sigma-hepta BDEs and BDE 209) in the studied population is influenced mainly by diet Dietary intakes of sigmatri-hepta BDEs (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183) were 5.9-22.0 ng/day (median 10.3), while those via dust ingestion were 0.1-1.4 ng/day (median 0.25) or 0.3-3.5 ng/day (average 0.6), assuming dust ingestion rates of 20 and 50 mg/day, respectively. Dietary intakes of BDE 209 were 50-238 ng/day (median 95), whereasthose via dust ingestion were 0.4-11 ng/day (median 1.8) or 1.0-29 ng/day (median 4.6) for dust ingestion rates of 20 and 50 mg/day, respectively. It is important to acknowledge the uncertainty associated with the dust ingestion rates. Concentrations of sigmatri-hepta BDEs measured in blood serum were 0.9-7.2 ng/g lipid weight (lw) (median 1.9). This is similar to other European populations, but lower than for nonoccupationally exposed Americans (average of 19 ng/g lw). When compared with estimates of exposure via both dietary and indoor dust ingestion for Americans, the exposures reported here are consistent with the hypothesis that the difference between European and American body burdens of PBDEs is attributable primarily to greater exposure via dust ingestion for Americans. The total intake of PBDEs through food and dustfor each participant could not be correlated with the corresponding serum concentration. Instead, it is hypothesized that past and episodic current higher intakes of PBDEs are more important determinants of body burden than continuous background exposures at the low levels measured in this study.
18606435	The levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in breast milk from Beijing, China, were studied. The 6 predominant PBDEs congeners (BDE47, BDE99, BDE100, BDE153, BDE154 and BDE183) in 23 pooled breast milk samples from 205 mothers living in Beijing were measured. Mean and median of SigmaPBDEs concentrations in all samples were 1.12 ng g(-1) lipid and 1.07 ng g(-1) lipid, respectively. The Statistical difference in SigmaPBDEs concentrations was found between urban areas (1.22 ng g(-1) lipid, n=14) and rural areas (0.97 ng g(-1) lipid n=9). The sum of BDE47 and BDE153 accounted for more than 70% of SigmaPBDEs in most samples. The significant correlation was found between the SigmaPBDEs in pooled samples and average of consumption of food of animal origin in the pools in urban area. However, there was no correlation was found between the SigmaPBDEs in pooled samples and average of consumption of food of animal origin in the pools in rural area of Beijing. The current study showed that the level of PBDEs in breast milk from Beijing was lower than that from South China and some developed countries such as USA and Sweden.
22236635	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent organic chemicals used as flame retardants in textiles, plastics, and consumer products. Although PBDE accumulation in humans has been noted since the 1970s, few studies have investigated PBDEs within the gestational compartment, and none to date has identified levels in amniotic fluid. The present study reports congener-specific brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) concentrations in second-trimester clinical amniotic fluid samples collected in 2009 from fifteen women in southeast Michigan, USA. Twenty-one BDE congeners were measured by GC/MS/NCI. The average total PBDE concentration was 3795 pg/ml amniotic fluid (range: 337-21,842 pg/ml). BDE-47 and BDE-99 were identified in all samples. Based on median concentrations, the dominant congeners were BDE-208, 209, 203, 206, 207, and 47 representing 23, 16, 12, 10, 9 and 6%, respectively, of the total detected PBDEs. PBDE concentrations were identified in all amniotic fluid samples from southeast Michigan, supporting a need for further investigations of fetal exposure pathways and potential impacts on perinatal health.
6270054	An analytical method was developed to quantitate polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls (PCBs and PBBs, respectively) in human serum. The method includes denaturation of the proteins in serum, extraction, adsorption chromatography, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The coefficients of variation for determining the in vivo bound PCBs and PBBs ranged from 11.7 to 29.8% and 7.1 to 14.0%, respectively. The method is capable of measuring 10 ng PCBs and PBBs/mL in 4 mL serum.
23619185	The developing nervous system is a potential target of environmental contaminants such as polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDE), which accumulate in the biosphere. We compared effects of 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromo-BDE (PBDE99), a PBDE congener present in environmental samples, and PCB on brain development. Time-pregnant rats were subcutaneously injected with PBDE99 (1 or 10mg/kg), the PCB mixture Aroclor 1254 (10mg/kg), or vehicle from gestational day 10-18. mRNA levels of genes involved in central control of reproductive functions and sexual behavior were analyzed by real time RT PCR in two sexually dimorphic brain regions, medial preoptic area (MPO) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of adult offspring of both sexes. Exposure to PBDE99 or the PCB mixture during pre- and postnatal development affected mRNA expression levels in a treatment-, region- and sex-specific manner, and changed the sensitivity of target genes to estradiol. The sex difference in progesterone receptor mRNA levels of VMH normally seen in untreated controls was abolished by both, PBDE99 and PCB. Estrous cycles were significantly affected, and preliminary experiments suggest an impairment of female sexual behavior. Our data indicate that developmental exposure to PBDE99 at doses below signs of general toxicity affects the regulation of estrogen target genes in rat brain. Since PBDE99 was detected in blood and adipose tissue of adult offspring, these effects may result from interactions with developmental processes, with adult functions, or a combination of both.
18022659	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as flame retardants in many different polymers, resins and substrates. Due to their widespread production and use, their high binding affinity to particles, and their lipophilic properties, several PBDE congeners can bioaccumulate in the environment. As a result, PBDEs and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs) have been detected in humans and various wildlife samples, such as birds, seals, and whales. Furthermore, certain OH-PBDEs and their methoxylated derivatives (MeO-PBDEs) are natural products in the marine environment. Recently, our laboratory focused on the possible effects on steroidogenesis of PBDEs and OH-PBDEs, e.g. in the human adrenocortical carcinoma (H295R) cell line indicating that some OH-PBDEs can significantly influence steroidogenic enzymes like CYP19 (aromatase) and CYP17. In the present study, human placental microsomes have been used to study the possible interaction of twenty two OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs with aromatase, the enzyme that mediates the conversion of androgens into estrogens. All OH-PBDE derivates showed significant inhibition of placental aromatase activity with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range, while the MeO-PBDEs did not have any effect on this enzyme activity. Enzyme kinetics studies indicated that two OH-PBDEs, 5-hydroxy-2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (5-OH-BDE47) and 6-hydroxy-2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (6-OH-BDE47), had a mixed-type inhibition of aromatase activity with apparent K(i)/K(i)' of 7.68/0,02 microM and 5.01/0.04 microM respectively. For comparison, some structurally related compounds, a dihydroxylated polybrominated biphenyl, which is a natural product (2,2'-dihyroxy-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl (2,2'-diOH-BB80)) and its non-bromo derivative were also included in the study. Again inhibition of aromatase activity could be measured, but their potency was significantly less than those observed for the OH-PBDEs. These results show that a wide range of OH-PBDEs have the potential to disturb steroidogenesis and indicate a potential mechanism of action of these brominated flame retardant derivatives as endocrine disruptors in humans and wildlife.
6245485	The introduction of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) into the Michigan food chain resulted in the presence of low levels of PBB in plasma pools used for blood fractionation. Pooled plasma lots contained an average of 1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml of PBB, while antihemophilic factor, fibrinogen, and immune serum globulin did not contain detectable amounts of PBB. Albumin (25%) lots contained an average of 2.0 +/- 0.4 ng/ml of PBB. Analysis of old lots showed that PBB first appeared in an albumin lot filled in January, 1974. Plasma used in preparing this lot was drawn during the period when PBB was entering the food chain. The results indicated that the behavior of chemical pollutants is an important consideration when fractionating blood or plasma collected in areas where industrial or environmental pollution have occurred.
21186423	A study was conducted to evaluate exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) among 144 men and women 55 to 74 years residing along the Hudson River. The results indicated a median serum PBDE concentration of 23.9 ng/g lipid wt. This value is similar to those of other New York State studies of populations that are younger and proportionately more likely to be male, suggesting that pathways do not differ by age or sex. Individual congeners were highly correlated, but they were not associated with concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Persons with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 had a geometric mean ΣPBDE concentration of 46.7 versus 25.2 ng/g lipid wt for persons with a BMI ≤ 30 (p = .006). Fresh water fish consumption was not associated with serum PBDE concentrations in this population.
22142821	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used extensively in electrical and electronic products, but little is known about the exposure level in the electrical appliance factories workers and nearby local residents. In this study, we assessed body burdens of PBDEs in 194 Chinese injection workers from electrical appliance factories and also measured 205 blood samples from catering workers, leather factory workers, umbilical cord and infertile men for comparison. Twelve PBDE congeners in serum samples were measured by GC-MS. The highest concentration for total PBDEs was found in injection workers, which is positively correlated to employment duration. BDE-209 was the most dominant congener followed by BDE-47, 28 and 99. We also found the presence of all twelve PBDEs in cord blood, suggesting an evidence of fetal exposure. Concentration of BDE-47 was particularly higher in serum samples from infertile men in comparison with that of catering workers and leather factory workers.
19211133	Despite documented widespread human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) through dietary intake and contact with or inhalation of indoor dust, along with growing laboratory evidence for altered endocrine function following exposure, human studies of PBDE exposure and endocrine effects remain limited. We conducted a preliminary study within an ongoing study on the impact of environmental exposures on male reproductive health. We measured serum hormone levels and PBDE concentrations (BDE 47, 99 and 100) in house dust from 24 men recruited through a US infertility clinic. BDE 47 and 99 were detected in 100% of dust samples, and BDE 100 was detected in 67% of dust samples, at concentrations similar to those reported in previous US studies. In multivariable regression models adjusted for age and BMI, there was a statistically significant inverse relationship between dust PBDE concentrations and free androgen index. Dust PBDE concentrations were also strongly and inversely associated with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and positively associated with inhibin B and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Finally, consistent with limited recent human studies of adults, PBDEs were positively associated with free T4. In conclusion, the present study provides compelling evidence of altered hormone levels in relation to PBDE exposures estimated as concentrations in house dust, and that house dust is an important source of human PBDE exposure, but more research is urgently needed.
12850099	Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been and are still heavily used as additive or reactive chemicals in polymers and textiles. Only a few of the BFRs have been assessed in human subjects with a major data set on internal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Increasing PBDE levels have been observed in mothers' milk from Sweden as well as in blood from Germany and Norway. The levels are in general lower than PCB levels. However, the PBDE concentrations found in the North Americans are considerably higher compared to European subjects. The PBDEs are dominated by 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47). Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) is reported both in the general population and in occupationally exposed persons showing the bioavailability of this high molecular weight compound. While the lower and medium brominated diphenyl ethers are persistent, BDE-209 has a fairly short half-life of approximately 2 weeks. Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is readily eliminated in humans showing a half-life of about 2 days. Still, TBBPA is accumulated in humans but a continuous exposure to this BFR is required to maintain a certain level in the human subject. TBBPA has not been detected in the general population but in people exposed at work. The current review addresses human exposure routes and levels of BFRs.
9647899	The long-term health effects of human exposure to polybrominated biphenyls are not known. In this nested case-control study, we evaluated the association between site-specific cancer risk and serum polybrominated biphenyl levels among a Michigan cohort accidentally exposed to polybrominated biphenyls in 1973. The Michigan Department of Public Health has followed 3,899 people through 1993, among whom 195 primary cancers were identified in 187 persons. Controls were 696 randomly selected cancer-free individuals who were frequency matched to cases by sex and age (in 5-year strata). Baseline serum polybrominated biphenyl levels were measured using standard methods. We found an increasing dose-response relation for digestive system cancer risk with higher serum polybrominated biphenyl category [4-20 parts per billion (ppb), 21-50 ppb, and > 50 ppb] after adjustment for age, family cancer history, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and baseline serum polychlorinated biphenyl level. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for each category were 8.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27-53.3], 12.3 (95% CI = 0.80-191), and 22.9 (95% CI = 1.34-392), respectively. Univariate analysis for polybrominated biphenyl level and lymphoma risk also showed a dose-response relation, with corresponding ORs of 3.24 (95% CI = 0.24-95.9), 20.5 (95% CI = 1.51-608), and 32.6 (95% CI = 3.33-861).
20375078	Developmental effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been suspected due to their structural similarities to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This study evaluated neurobehavioral, hormonal, and reproductive effects in rat offspring perinatally exposed to a widely used pentabrominated commercial mixture, DE-71. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were exposed to 0, 1.7, 10.2, or 30.6 mg/kg/day DE-71 in corn oil by oral gavage from gestational day 6 to weaning. DE-71 did not alter maternal or male offspring body weights. However, female offspring were smaller compared with controls from postnatal days (PNDs) 35-60. Although several neurobehavioral endpoints were assessed, the only statistically significant behavioral finding was a dose-by-age interaction in the number of rears in an open-field test. Developmental exposure to DE-71 caused severe hypothyroxinemia in the dams and early postnatal offspring. DE-71 also affected anogenital distance and preputial separation in male pups. Body weight gain over time, reproductive tissue weights, and serum testosterone concentrations at PND 60 were not altered. Mammary gland development of female offspring was significantly affected at PND 21. Congener-specific analysis of PBDEs indicated accumulation in all tissues examined. Highest PBDE concentrations were found in fat including milk, whereas blood had the lowest concentrations on a wet weight basis. PBDE concentrations were comparable among various brain regions. Thus, perinatal exposure to DE-71 leads to accumulation of PBDE congeners in various tissues crossing blood-placenta and blood-brain barriers, causing subtle changes in some parameters of neurobehavior and dramatic changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels, as well as changes in both male and female reproductive endpoints. Some of these effects are similar to those seen with PCBs, and the persistence of these changes requires further investigation.
6304939	Adult (5 months) male Sherman strain rats received a single dose of either 0 or 500 mg polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) in corn oil/kg body weight by stomach tube. After an 18-month recovery period, serum and liver samples were examined. The primary serum lipid response was an increase in cholesterol (both free and esterified) and in total phospholipids. The percentage of esterified cholesterol was not significantly different from that of the controls, and no significant differences in the cholesterol ester fatty acid composition were observed. Serum triglycerides were also unaffected. In the PBB-dosed animals, the total hepatic fatty acids contained significantly less palmitic acid and more stearic acid, consistent with an increase in palmitic acid chain elongation activity. No significant differences could be detected in the n-3 or n-6 acids except for a slight decline in the content of 22:6 (n-3). Hepatic microsomal phospholipids were slightly higher (per milligram protein) in the PBB-dosed animals, and the cholesterol content was lower. Consequently, the cholesterol-phospholipid ratio was reduced, and microsomes from the latter group appeared to have an altered lipid domain on the basis of steady-state fluorescence anisotrophy measurements. In addition, total hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (assayed as malondialdehyde) were significantly increased in the PBB-dosed animals. This observation appeared to reflect an increased susceptibility to peroxidative stress in the latter group, probably resulting from reduced membrane antioxidant concentrations. The PBB-dosed rats had significantly lower serum retinol levels and a reduced content of this vitamin in liver microsomes. Microsomes were also deficient in alpha-tocopherol in the PBB-dosed animals, although serum levels were normal.
16053925	Persistent organic pollutants have been linked to various adverse effects on human health. We conducted a retrospective exposure assessment for 11polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 4 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners. We analyzed paired samples of blood and food duplicate portions collected in the 1980s (1980 survey, N=40) and the mid-1990s (1995 survey, N=40) from females (five participants from each of eight sites per survey) living throughout Japan, from Hokkaido to Okinawa. The study populations in the 1980 and 1995 surveys were different but had lived in the same community. We measured PCBs and PBDEs in serum and PCBs in diet. Total serum PCBs (ng/g lipid) [geometric mean (geometric standard deviation)] were similar in the 1980 [163.0 (1.7)] and the 1995 [142.6 (2.0)] surveys. In contrast, dietary intake (ng/day) between 1980 and 1995 decreased significantly, from 522.8 (2.5) to 165.9 (3.3), respectively, (P<0.05). We classified the participants by birth year-before 1941 (older generation) and equal to or after 1941 (younger generation). Serum PCB levels decreased significantly in the younger generation, from 179.1 (1.8) in the 1980 survey to 115.4 (2.0) in the 1995 survey (P<0.05). However, in the older generation, serum levels (ng/g lipid) did not change: 150.4 (1.6) in the 1980 survey and 180 (1.8) in the 1995 survey. Total PBDE serum levels (ng/g lipid) increased significantly during the 15 years, from 0.5 (3.5) to 1.8 (3.7) (P<0.05). At the Shimane site, PBDE serum levels (ng/g lipid) increased 20-fold, from 1.3 (4.8) to 26.0 (5.0). The serum levels of PCBs decreased in the younger generation but not in the older, although levels in daily intakes decreased significantly. Exposure levels of PBDEs appear to be increasing in an area-specific manner.
20609460	Male common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from eastern Lake Erie, which is greatly effected by urbanization, agriculture, and industry, were analyzed for PCB and PBDE concentrations in plasma, muscle, and liver to evaluate exposure to these chemicals through habitat interactions. Additional male carp from two nearby relatively clean lakes (Bear Lake and Hemlock Lake, NY) were also sampled as controls. While PCBs were detected in muscle, liver, and plasma of Lake Erie carp, the largest concentrations were found in muscle, which also had the most number of congeners. The dominant congeners were PCB 138 and PCB 153. Concentrations of PCB 153 in the muscle were correlated with fish length, total weight, and age. Therefore, larger (and generally older) carp had the highest concentrations of PCB 153. In contrast, PBDEs were found only in muscle with the predominant congener being PBDE 47. The total PCB concentrations in muscle of male carp from eastern Lake Erie (ranging from nd to 15,000 ng g(-1) lipid) were 100-fold higher than the total PBDE observed (1.5-100 ng g(-1) lipid), indicating a higher level of contamination of PCBs in Lake Erie. The high PCB levels in carp points to PCB resistance to metabolic degradation.
2551196	Serum samples from 285 4-year-old Michigan children were evaluated for levels of 11 environmental contaminants. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in half the samples tested; polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in 13-21 percent; dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), in more than 70 percent. Nursing (Mothers' milk) was the principal source of these exposures. Congener-specific analysis documented the presence of at least one highly toxic PCB congener, 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl. The data demonstrate the multigenerational impact of female exposure to persistent organic environmental contaminants.
7768229	Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), a flame-retardant material, was introduced into the food chain in Michigan in 1973 due to a manufacturing and distribution mistake. Following public concern about the long-term health effects of PBB in humans, a cohort of PBB-exposed Michigan residents was assembled in 1975. We initiated this study to determine the half-life of PBB in human sera and to understand how continued body burden relates to the possible adverse health consequences of PBB exposure. To determine the half-life, eligible persons were selected from the cohort if they had at least two PBB measurements 1 year apart and had an initial level > or = 20 pbb. There were 163 persons who met the criteria with a median PBB level of 45.5 ppb. The estimated half-life is 10.8 years (95% CI, 9.2-14.7 years). The body burden of PBB in exposed persons will decrease only gradually over time. For persons with an initial level of 45.5 ppb of PBB, it will take more than 60 years for their PBB levels to fall below the current level of detection of 1 ppb.
20079522	We and others have previously described partitioning of chemicals, including polychlorinated-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and biphenyls in different types of human tissues and fluids, including blood and milk. Additionally, we previously reported the blood to milk partitioning of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in a group of 11 women. Partitioning is of importance in understanding the toxicokinetics of these compounds and also in clinical medicine in improving estimates of levels in different matrices including blood and milk. In this study we extend these findings, describing the levels of PBDEs detected in the serum and milk of 29 women from Texas. The median sum of the levels of the four most detected congeners (BDE 47, 99, 100, and 153) in serum was 27.8 ng g(-1) lipid (range 6.7-501.6 ng g(-1) lipid). In milk, the median sum of the levels of the same congeners was 39.7 ng g(-1) lipid (range 12.9-580.3 ng g(-1) lipid). The levels detected in breast milk in this study are similar to those we reported in 2003, where a median total PBDE level of 34 ng g(-1) lipid was reported. When congener specific blood to milk partitioning ratios were calculated for BDEs 47, 99, 100, and 153, the relatively small tetrabrominated congener, BDE 47, was found in higher concentrations in milk compared to blood, while the higher molecular weight hexabrominated congener, BDE 153, was found in approximately equal quantities in blood and milk, on a lipid normalized basis. The reason for the differential partitioning of PBDE congeners in milk and blood could be due to variation in toxicokinetics, specifically distribution based on molecular size or molecular weight.
17035135	OBJECTIVES: Our objectives in this study were to expand a previously reported U.S. market basket survey using a larger sample size and to estimate levels of PBDE intake from food for the U.S. general population by sex and age. METHODS: We measured concentrations of 13 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners in food in 62 food samples. In addition, we estimated levels of PBDE intake from food for the U.S. general population by age (birth through > or = 60 years of age) and sex. RESULTS: In food samples, concentrations of total PBDEs varied from 7.9 pg/g (parts per trillion) in milk to 3,726 pg/g in canned sardines. Fish were highest in PBDEs (mean, 1,120 pg/g; median, 616 pg/g; range, 11.14-3,726 pg/g). This was followed by meat (mean, 383 pg/g; median, 190 pg/g; range, 39-1,426 pg/g) and dairy products (mean, 116 pg/g; median, 32.2 pg/g; range, 7.9-683 pg/g). However, using estimates for food consumption (excluding nursing infants), meat accounted for the highest U.S. dietary PBDE intake, followed by dairy and fish, with almost equal contributions. Adult females had lower dietary intake of PBDEs than did adult males, based on body weight. We estimated PBDE intake from food to be 307 ng/kg/day for nursing infants and from 2 ng/kg/day at 2-5 years of age for both males and females to 0.9 ng/kg/day in adult females. CONCLUSION: Dietary exposure alone does not appear to account for the very high body burdens measured. The indoor environment (dust, air) may play an important role in PBDE body burdens in addition to food. 
22327115	In 2009 and 2010, 720 serum samples were collected from non-occupationally exposed study participants at four Korean locations and monitored for the presence of 27 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners. The median concentrations of Σ(27)PBDEs (the sum of 27 congeners) and Σ(3-7)PBDEs (the sum of tri- to hepta-BDE congeners) were 6.04 and 4.97 ng/g lipid, respectively. The most abundant congener detected in serum samples was BDE-153, followed by BDE-47 and BDE-99. The median value of Σ(3-7)PBDEs was similar to the median values observed in Asia and Europe, but much lower than that observed in North America. Some significant differences, based on geographic region and sex, were observed. We also observed a positive increase of BDE-153 with regard to age. In addition, we estimated the daily exposure to PBDEs from previously published reports of PBDE concentrations in food and dust, and determined the individual contributions of a variety of sources.
22230173	Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs) have obtained increasing attention; however, few analytical methods are available for sensitive identification of these compounds in water. In this paper, we developed a highly sensitive method for simultaneous determination of nine OH-PBDEs in water by using hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced cartridge extraction, silica cartridge purification, and the combination of derivatization with liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The effective sample pretreatment process and greatly increased instrumental sensitivity by derivatization allow for the quantification of nine OH-PBDEs at a method detection limit of 0.04-3.5 pg/L with 1-L wastewater treatment plant effluent or river water. This method was applied to wastewater effluent and river water samples collected in Beijing, China, where two OH-tetraPBDEs were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.63 to 1.0 pg/L (5-OH-BDE-47) and from 0.92 to 1.3 pg/L (6-OH-BDE-47).
16650462	The levels of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs): p,p'-DDT and its metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), chlordanes and their metabolites, and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were measured in maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and human milk collected from 22 mothers living in the Wielkopolska region, Poland. Additionally, 11 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were measured in the human milk samples. p,p'-DDT and its major metabolite, p,p'-DDE, together with HCB, were found in all milk and serum samples. Median concentrations of p,p'-DDE in maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and milk were 343, 329 and 634ng/g lipid weight (lw). PCB congeners 138, 153 and 180 were the major congeners measured in all serum samples, while CB 170 was detected in 74% and 100% of umbilical cord and maternal serum, respectively. Except for CBs 74, 101 and 105, which had a detection frequency of 77%, 23% and 82%, respectively, all investigated PCB congeners were measured in all human milk samples. The median concentrations of sum PCBs in maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and milk were 79, 60 and 133 ng/g lw, respectively. A good correlation (Spearman R(S)>0.75, p<0.001) was found for major PCBs, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, between maternal and umbilical cord serum, while the correlation was weaker between milk and serum. The median of sum PBDEs in human milk was 2.0 ng/g lw (range 0.8 to 8.4), with BDE 47 being always the most abundant PBDE congener and, together with BDE 153, being present in all samples. In general, results found in the investigated group are at the low end of the concentration range measured in Europe.
19031918	Studies show higher house dust and body burden levels of PBDE flame retardants in North America than Europe; but little is known about exposure variation within North America, where California's furniture flammability standard affects PBDE use. We compared dust samples from 49 homes in two California communities with 120 Massachusetts homes and with other published studies. Dust concentrations [median (range) ng/g] in California homes of BDE-47, -99, and -100 were 2700 (112-107,000), 3800 (102-170,000), and 684 (<MRL-30,900), respectively, and were 4-10 times higher than previously reported in North America. Maximum concentrations were the highest ever reported in indoor dust. We then investigated whether human serum PBDE levels were also higher in California compared to other North American regions by analyzing the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the only data set available with serum from a representative sample of the U.S. population (n=2040). California residence was significantly associated with nearly 2-fold higher sigma PBDE serum levels [least square geometric mean (LSGM) ng/g lipid, 73.0 vs 38.5 (p = 0.002)]. Elevated PBDE exposures in California may result from the state's furniture flammability standards; our results suggest the need for further research in a larger representative sample.
20444483	Fetal and maternal exposure levels of two emerging pollutants, polybrominated diephenyl ethers (PBDEs) and synthetic musks, were measured in Korean general population to assess prenatal and postnatal exposures in infants. For this purpose, paired samples of breast milk, maternal and cord blood were collected from 20 Korean women in 2007. In comparison to data from other countries and previous data from Korea, relatively higher and gradually increasing concentrations for PBDEs were found in Korean breast milk (< LOQ to 590 ng g(-1) lipid wt; median=90 ng g(-1)). Differences in PBDEs and musk concentrations were found among age groups and parity levels. PBDEs concentrations in breast milk were lower in the younger mothers and/or the mothers with multiple parities, while these trends were not found for musks. Compared with PBDEs, concentrations of musks were significantly lower in breast milk than in serum and a little correlation in concentrations among the three human biological matrices were observed. The differences in the profiles of musks relative to PBDEs were due to different clearance rates between these two compounds. The average hazard quotients (HQs) for daily intake of PBDEs by infants via lactation were 0.62, 0.42, and 0.19 for BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-153, respectively.
18330785	Thyroid alterations have been shown to occur following exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) mixtures, possibly indicating that disruptions in thyroid hormone levels may underlie behavior deficits observed in animals following postnatal PBDE exposure. This study determined whether acute postnatal exposure to PBDE-47 would alter thyroid hormones. Mice were dosed with PBDE-47 on postnatal day 10, and serum collected either 1, 5, or 10 days after the dose. No effect was observed on thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels at any age examined. This suggests that the neurological abnormalities reported in mice exposed to PBDE-47 are not due to acute changes in circulating thyroid hormones at these observed periods.
20540541	While young children are rarely included in biomonitoring studies, they are presumed to be at greater risk of ingesting environmental contaminants-particularly those that accumulate in foods or shed from consumer products. The widely used fire retardants polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous contaminants in the indoor environment and are widely detected at higher levels in Americans than in individuals from other countries. However, there are only three studies of PBDEs in U.S. children. We hypothesized that PBDEs are present in higher concentrations in young children than their mothers. PBDEs were assessed in blood samples collected concurrently from 20 mothers and their children, ages 1.5 to 4 years. The chemical analyses were performed by GC/MS applying selected ion monitoring. The samples were analyzed for 20 PBDE congeners; 11 were detected. SigmaPBDEs for children were typically 2.8 times higher than for mothers, with median child:mother ratios varying from 2 to 4 for individual congeners. In 19 of 20 families studied, children had higher SigmaPBDE concentrations than their mothers with significant (p < 0.01) concentration differences for five of the PBDE congeners. Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) was quantitated in 13 children and 9 mothers. Other studies indicate PBDEs are not elevated at birth, suggesting that early life is an intense period of PBDE intake. Children's increased hand-to-mouth activity, dietary preferences, and exposures from breast milk may result in greater ingestion of PBDEs than adults. These findings suggest that measurements from adults likely do not reflect exposures to young children despite sharing homes and similar diets.
22049977	This study investigated the formation of DNA adducts of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and the possible mechanisms. DNA adduction was conducted by in vitro reaction of deoxyguanosine (dG) and DNA with PBDE-quinone (PBDE-Q) metabolites, and DNA adducts were characterized by using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The results suggested DNA adduction involved Michael Addition between the exocyclic NH(2) group at the N-2 position of dG and the electron-deficient carbon of quinone, followed by reductive cyclization with loss of (bromo-)1-hydroperoxy-benzene or water to form a type I or type II adduct. PBDE-Q with substituted bromine on the quinone ring was proven to be a favorable structure to form a type I adduct, while the absence of bromine on the quinone ring resulted in a type II adduct. Lower reactivity of adduction was also observed with increasing the number of bromine atoms on the phenoxyl ring. Our data clearly demonstrated PBDEs could covalently bind to DNA mediated by quinone metabolites, depending on the degree of bromine substitution. This study opened a new view on the mechanism of toxicity of PBDEs and reported the structure of PBDE-DNA adducts, which might be valuable for the evaluation on potential in vivo formation of PBDE-DNA adducts.
21953308	The study aimed to examine the impact of prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) on infant neurodevelopment. PBDEs levels in 36 cord blood samples were analyzed with a high-resolution-gas-chromatograph/high-resolution-mass-spectrometer and infant neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. The mean and median of Σ(11)PBDEs were 6.63 and 4.63 ng/g lipid, respectively. As compared to the lower PBDEs group (Σ(11)PBDEs < 4.63 ng/g lipid), the higher PBDEs group (Σ(11)PBDEs > 4.63 ng/g lipid) had a significantly higher actual odds ratio (OR = 1.13, p < 0.05) of the cognition score as well as a lower odds ratio (OR = 0.904, p < 0.01) of the adaptive behavior score, suggesting that prenatal PBDEs exposure may potentially affect infant neurodevelopment.
21821059	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and the structurally similar chemicals polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) disrupt the function of multiple endocrine systems. PCBs and PBDEs disrupt the secretion of vasopressin (VP) from the hypothalamus during osmotic activation. Since the peripheral and central vasopressinergic axes are critical for osmotic and cardiovascular regulation, we examined whether perinatal PBDE exposure could impact these functions during physiological activation. Rats were perinatally dosed with a commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71. Dams were given 0 (corn oil control), 1.7 (low dose) or 30.6 mg/kg/day (high dose) in corn oil from gestational day (GD) 6 through postnatal day (PND) 21 by oral gavage. In the male offspring exposed to high dose PBDE plasma thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were reduced at PND 21 and recovered to control levels by PND 60 when thyroid stimulating hormone levels were elevated. At 14-18 months of age, cardiovascular responses were measured in four groups of rats: Normal (Oil, normosmotic condition), Hyper (Oil, hyperosmotic stress), Hyper PBDE low (1.7 mg/kg/day DE-71 perinatally, hyperosmotic stress), and Hyper PBDE high (30.6 mg/kg/day DE-71 perinatally, hyperosmotic stress). Systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and heart rate (HR) were determined using tail cuff sphygmomanometry and normalized to pretreatment values (baseline) measured under basal conditions. Hyperosmotic treatment yielded significant changes in systolic BP in PBDE exposed rats only. Hyper PBDE low and high dose rats showed 36.1 and 64.7% greater systolic BP responses at 3h post hyperosmotic injection relative to pretreatment baseline, respectively. No treatment effects were measured for diastolic BP and HR. Hyper and Hyper PBDE rats showed increased mean plasma osmolality values by 45 min after injection relative to normosmotic controls. In contrast to Hyper rats, Hyper PBDE (high) rats showed a further increase in mean plasma osmolality at 3h (358.3±12.4mOsm/L) relative to 45 min post hyperosmotic injection (325.1±11.4mOsm/L). Impaired osmoregulation in PBDE-treated animals could not be attributed to decreased levels of plasma vasopressin. Our findings suggest that developmental exposure to PBDEs may disrupt cardiovascular reactivity and osmoregulatory responses to physiological activation in late adulthood.
20521814	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been measured in the home environment and in humans, but studies linking environmental levels to body burdens are limited. This study examines the relationship between PBDE concentrations in house dust and serum from adults residing in these homes. We measured PBDE concentrations in house dust from 50 homes and in serum of male-female couples from 12 of the homes. Detection rates, dust-serum, and within-matrix correlations varied by PBDE congener. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.65-0.89, p < 0.05) between dust and serum concentrations of several predominant PBDE congeners (BDE 47, 99, and 100). Dust and serum levels of BDE 153 were not correlated (r < 0.01). The correlation of dust and serum levels of BDE 209 could not be evaluated due to low detection rates of BDE 209 in serum. Serum concentrations of the sum of BDE 47, 99, and 100 were also strongly correlated within couples (r = 0.85, p = 0.0005). This study provides evidence that house dust is a primary exposure pathway of PBDEs and supports the use of dust PBDE concentrations as a marker for exposure to PBDE congeners other than BDE 153.
20471317	Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), in particular the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), have been used in consumer products for many years to increase fire resistance. Recently, developmental neurotoxicity at very low levels has increased the concern about these compounds. The major objectives of this study were to investigate the maternal and fetal exposure to PBDEs on the basis of maternal and umbilical cord plasma samples and to study the extent of placental transfer for different PBDE congeners. The findings were also compared with previously observed PBDE levels and patterns determined in placental tissue from the same individuals, and the relationship with the external exposure from house dust from the participants' homes was explored. Samples of maternal and umbilical cord plasma from a cohort of 51 pregnant women from the Copenhagen area were collected. Paired maternal and umbilical cord plasma were analysed for BDE-28, 37, 47, 85, 99, 100, 119, 138, 153, 154, 183, 209 and the brominated biphenyl BB-153 using automated SPE extraction and GC-HRMS for the tri- to hepta-BDEs and GC-LRMS (ECNI) for BDE-209. PBDEs were detected in all maternal and umbilical cord plasma samples. The sum of tri- to hexa-BDEs (SigmaPBDE) in maternal plasma varied between 640 and 51,946 pg/g lipid weight (lw) with a median level of 1765 pg/g lw. In the umbilical cord samples SigmaPBDE varied between 213 and 54,346 pg/g lw with a median of 958 pg/g lw. The levels observed in fetal and maternal plasma were highly correlated, but the placental transport of PBDE congeners was found to decrease with increasing diphenyl ether bromination. Maternal concentrations were significantly correlated (p<0.05) for most congeners with the previously determined concentrations in placental tissue from the same individuals. Furthermore, positive correlations (p<0.05) were found for BDE-28, 47, 100, 209 and SigmaPBDE in maternal plasma and house dust as well as for SigmaPBDE in umbilical cord plasma and house dust. The positive correlations for PBDEs for both maternal and umbilical cord plasma with house dust showed that domestic house dust is a significant source of human exposure to PBDEs in Denmark including in utero exposure.
21550663	Breast milk has been widely used as a bioindicator to assess the extent of human exposure to PBDEs via various exposure routes. In this study, 48 breast milk samples were collected from primiparous women in Shanghai city, and 14 PBDEs congeners (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -183, -196, -197, -203, -206, -207, -208, and -209) were quantified using gas chromatography-electron capture negative ionization-mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of total PBDEs was 8.6 ng/g lipid weight, and ranged from 1.8 to 26.7 ng/g lipid weight. These concentration levels were similar to those reported in Europe and Asia, but one order of magnitude lower than those in North America. The congener profiles in this study exhibited a specific pattern in human milk found worldwide, BDE-153 and BDE-28 accounted for a relatively higher proportion of lower brominated BDEs (from tri- to hepta-BDEs), whereas higher brominated BDEs (from octa- to deca-BDEs) contributed more than 70% of the total PBDEs. The Spearman's correlation coefficient among higher brominated BDEs showed a positive relationship, and concentration levels of higher brominated BDEs were statistically different between office workers and housewives. Due to relatively higher proportion of PBDEs from octa- to deca-BDEs were detected, air inhalation and dust ingestion might be the major exposure routes of higher brominated BDEs. Further research is needed to clarify the major exposure route of higher brominated BDEs to humans.
15369322	PBDEs are being released to the environment in wastes from their production facilities, degradation, or leaching and volatilization from products that contain PBDEs during the product's useful life. Brominated diphenyl ether congeners BDE-47, -99, and -153 are ubiquitous in the environment and are regarded as the most dominant congeners present in wildlife and humans. The tetra- to hexa-BDE are most likely the congeners to which humans are exposed through food consumption. Knowledge of PBDE uptake, metabolism, elimination, and enzyme induction is restricted largely to rodents (rats and mice) in vitro and in vivo. Feeding studies have shown that excretion of higher brominated BDEs is much greater than lower brominated BDEs. Penta-BDE is more toxic than octa- and deca-BDE following oral administration (oral LD50 in rats, 0.5-5 g/kg). In rodents, repeated exposure to PBDEs results in thyroid hormone disruption, developmental neurotoxicity, some changes of fetal development, and hepatotoxic effects. The observed chronic NOELs depend upon the technical mixture type (i.e., deca-, octa-, or penta- and their congener composition), animal species, and study protocol. Values range from 0.6 to 100 mg/kg in rats and from I to 100 mg/kg in mice. PBDEs are neither mutagenic nor genotoxic. Immunotoxicity in mice is observed following exposure to BDE-47 at 18 mg/kg/d, where splenocyte number decreased. Mice exposed neonatally to a single oral dose of BDE-47(10.5 mg/kg) or BDE-99 (12 mg/kg) on Pnd10 (period of rapid brain growth and development) show permanent impairment of spontaneous motor behavior when reaching adulthood. BDE-99 also induced adverse effects on learning and memory functions of mice. The estimated daily intake based on food consumption for PBDEs ranges from 44 to 51 ng/d, with fish contributing almost one-half. The BDE-99 body burden from a human milk survey can be estimated at 0.64 microg/kg, well below the experimental body burden of 0.4 mg/kg BDE-99 associated with behavioral alterations in neonatal mice. When considering the outlier value for PBDE-99 at 229 ng/g, this would result in an estimated PBDE-99 body burden of 46 microg/kg, or a MOS of only 9. However, no toxicokinetics data are available for humans, and the actual margin of safety may be much smaller if based on levels in critical target organs or tissues.
19022362	Environmental pollutants can adversely affect the immune system. The host defence during infection depends on cytokine signalling and proper function of immune cells. However, no studies have addressed how polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) affect cytokine responses. We investigated the combined effects in Balb/c mice of human coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection and exposure to PBDEs (BDE-99 or Bromkal mixture) on 21 serum cytokines. The mice were infected (i.p.) on day 0, orally treated with BDE-99 or Bromkal on day 1 (20mg/kg bw) and put to death on day 3. CVB3 was quantitatively measured in the liver and pancreas by RT-PCR. The Luminex 200 multi-analyte system was used for cytokine analysis. High numbers of viral copies were found in the liver and pancreas. Infection increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-12p40, KC and RANTES levels. Notably, PBDE-exposure resulted in a marked decrease, or even lack, of IL-13, MIP-1beta, RANTES, IFN-gamma and KC levels in non-infected mice. However, the effects of PBDE-exposure on cytokines did not affect viral replication during early CVB3 infection. In conclusion, PBDEs causes a selective block in immune signalling pathways but the consequences of this need to be further studied in different host resistance models of infection.
209978	In November, 1976 the Environmental Sciences Laboratory of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, examined 1029 persons in Michigan for the potential health effects of exposure to PBB. Included in this group were 55 persons from Michigan Chemical Corporation and 237 farming families. Blood serum was analyzed for PBB. FireMaster FF-1 contains several bromobiphenyl components, the major constituent being approximately 60% 2,4,4,2'4'4'-hexabromobiphenyl. Other PBB homologs identifiable as peaks by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry include two pentabromobiphenyl peaks, three additional hexabromobiphenyl peaks, and two heptabromobiphenyl peaks. The relative concentrations, with respect to the major hexabromobiphenyl peak, of these minor constituents (1--20%) of PBB were different for persons from Michigan Chemical Corporation and for farmers. Penta-, hexa-, and hepta-bromobiphenyl components in serum samples analyzed from farming families from Michigan Chemical Corporation employees were compared with relative concentrations of these homologs in FireMaster mixture and in tissue and blood samples from rats fed FireMaster FF-1. Varying concentrations of these PBB components are attributed to different routes of exposure and the relative ease of metabolism and excretion of one pentabromobiphenyl component.
22088798	In vivo studies indicate that prenatal or neonatal exposure of rodents to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) disrupts thyroid hormone balance, but few studies have reported an association of PBDEs and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The goal was to examine whether PBDEs exposure affects the levels of thyroid hormones and IGF-1 in cord blood. Study participants were healthy pregnant women recruited from the general population in central Taiwan between 2000 and 2001 and in southern Taiwan from 2007 to 2009. One-hundred-forty-nine breast milk samples (n=149), which were collected within one month after delivery, were analyzed using a high resolution gas chromatograph equipped with a high resolution mass spectrometer. The average and median levels of breast milk Σ(14)PBDEs were 5.34 and 3.38 ng/g lipid in 2000-2001 and 5.22 and 3.13 ng/g lipid in 2007-2009, respectively. In general, levels of PBDE congeners were very low in this study population and not significantly different between the years 2000-2001 and 2007-2009. Breast milk Σ(14)PBDEs were not significantly correlated with thyroid hormones and IGF-1 in cord blood. After examining multiple stepwise linear regression models with adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), parity, gestational age, and region (namely, central and southern Taiwan), we found that log of T4 in cord blood was significantly but slightly correlated with higher BDE-154 (B=0.113, p=0.017) in breast milk. The log of FT4 concentration was significantly related to a decrease in the log of BDE-99 level (B=-0.137, p=0.043) and an increase in the log of BDE-154 level (B=0.158, p=0.008). Meanwhile, the log of IGF-1 level was also significantly linked to an increase in the log of BDE-196 level (B=0.532, p=0.028) and decrease in the log of BDE-85 level (B=-0.235, p=0.018). Few epidemiological studies report an association between PBDEs exposure and IGF-1. Based on our findings, further in vivo and epidemiological studies are encouraged and needed to explore associations between PBDEs exposure and levels of thyroid hormones and IGF-1.
18320132	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardants; currently, they are identified as ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Several studies indicate that PBDEs might affect male fertility. We present the results of a pilot study on the relationship between human serum PBDEs and sperm quality. The PBDE levels in Japan are comparable to those found in European countries. Strong inverse correlations were observed between the serum concentration of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether and sperm concentration (r = -0.841, p = 0.002) and testis size (r = -0.764, p = 0.01). Extensive studies on the relationship between PBDEs and sperm quality are required.
17000572	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of brominated flame retardants, are frequently used in consumer products. PBDEs levels in environmental and human samples have increased in recent decades. Children are exposed to PBDEs through diet, mainly through fish, meat and milk. Total dietary exposure of children in Europe was calculated to be 2-3 ng/kg b.w./day. For nursing infants the main source of PBDE exposure is breast milk; exposure levels are around 15 ng/kg b.w./day. PBDE exposure levels in North America are 10 to a 100 times higher. Because of their persistence and their similarity to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), concern has been raised about the effects of PBDEs on human health. Exposure to penta- and octa-BDE led to learning impairment and impaired motor behaviour in rodents. Exposure to penta-, octa- and also deca-BDE caused effects on thyroid homeostasis in animals. CONCLUSIONS: The EU has banned the production and use of penta- and octa-BDE since 2004; however, exposure will continue during the coming decades. Based upon current toxicological evidence, human exposure to deca-BDEs is not expected to lead to health effects, but data on exposure to deca-BDE and data on toxicity of deca-BDE are scarce. Therefore, monitoring studies and toxicity studies on deca-BDEs and other BDEs should continue. 
18218189	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are isolated and recovered with acceptable percent recoveries from human serum via liquid-liquid extraction and column chromatographic cleanup and fractionation with quantitation using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electron capture negative ion and selected ion monitoring. PBDEs are found in unspiked serum. An alternative sample preparation approach is developed using sheep serum that utilizes a formic acid pre-treatment followed by reversed-phase solid-phase disk extraction and normal-phase solid-phase cleanup using acidified silica gel that yields>50% recoveries. When these percent recoveries are combined with a minimized phase ratio for human serum and very low instrument detection limits, method detection limits below 500 parts-per-trillion are realized.
22572111	There is evidence of endocrine disruption and reproductive effects in animals following exposure to certain PBDEs, but human studies are limited. The goal of this study was to investigate the use of serum and follicular fluid as biomarkers of exposure to PBDEs and to explore whether a relationship between PBDE exposure and early pregnancy loss exists. We measured 8 PBDE congeners in archived serum and ovarian follicular fluid samples from 65 women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Logistic regression models were used to predict the odds of failed embryo implantation associated with higher levels of PBDEs among the women in the study. There were moderate Kendall's Tau-beta correlations between serum and follicular fluid concentrations of BDE 28, 47, 100 and 154 (T(β)=0.29-0.38, all p-values<0.005), but BDE 99 and 153 were not correlated between the two matrices (T(β)<0.2, p-values>0.05). Women with detectable concentrations of BDE 153 (39% had detectable levels) in follicular fluid had elevated odds of failed implantation compared with women who had non-detectable concentrations (adjusted OR=10.0; 95%CI: 1.9 to 52; p=0.006; adjusted by age and body mass index). These findings suggest that exposure to BDE 153 may be associated with failed embryo implantation. Due to our observation of only moderate correlations between matrices, serum PBDE concentrations may not be a good indicator of follicular fluid concentrations when studying early pregnancy endpoints in women undergoing IVF.
12842781	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as flame retardants in consumer goods, such as plastics, electronics, textiles, and construction material. PBDEs have been found in human milk, fat, and blood samples. Rodent studies indicate that PBDEs may be detrimental to neurodevelopment, possibly by lowering thyroid hormone concentrations in blood. In the present study, we determined concentrations of PBDEs and thyroid hormones in human fetal and maternal serum. Patients presenting in labor to Indiana University and Wishard Memorial County hospitals in Indianapolis, who were older than 18 years, were recruited to participate. Twelve paired samples of maternal and cord blood were obtained and analyzed using gas chromatographic mass spectrometry; thyroid hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Six congeners of PBDE were measured in maternal and fetal serum samples. The concentrations of total PBDEs found in maternal sera ranged from 15 to 580 ng/g lipid, and the concentrations found in fetal samples ranged from 14 to 460 ng/g lipid. Individual fetal blood concentrations did not differ from the corresponding maternal concentrations, indicating that measurement of maternal PBDE blood levels is useful in predicting fetal exposure; similarly, other reports have shown a high correlation between PBDE in mother's milk and fetal exposure. In accord with reports on other biologic samples, the tetrabrominated PBDE congener BDE-47 accounted for 53-64% of total PBDEs in the serum. The concentrations of PBDEs found in maternal and fetal serum samples were 20-106-fold higher than the levels reported previously in a similar population of Swedish mothers and infants. In this small sample, there was no apparent correlation between serum PBDEs and thyroid hormone concentrations. Our study shows that human fetuses in the United States may be exposed to relatively high levels of PBDEs. Further investigation is required to determine if these levels are specific to central Indiana and to assess the toxic potential of these exposure levels.
22819984	Human serum and mother's milk are frequently used to assess exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), including transplacental transfer to the foetus. However, little is known about the kinetics of PBDEs, especially the highly brominated BDE congeners. In this pilot study, maternal serum samples were collected from 10 women at delivery and five to six weeks post partum. Umbilical serum was also obtained. Milk was donated two to five days, and five to six weeks after delivery. The amount of PBDEs in these samples was determined using liquid-liquid extraction and GC/MS. Low, moderately and highly brominated diphenyl ethers were present in umbilical cord serum, indicating placental transfer. The lipid-adjusted levels of BDE-47, BDE-207 and BDE-209 were similar in maternal and umbilical cord serum, whereas the cord serum levels for the penta- to octa-BDEs quantified were lower than in maternal serum. Marked changes were seen in the congener pattern in breast milk during the first month of lactation, whereas maternal serum levels did not change significantly. The general pattern was an enrichment of low to moderately brominated congeners (i.e. from BDE-17 to BDE-154, with the exception of BDE-28) in colostrum compared with maternal serum. In contrast, more highly brominated congeners were found at similar, or lower levels in colostrum than in maternal serum. After the transition from colostrum to mature milk, the levels of BDE-153 and BDE-209 were substantially reduced, and BDE-209 was below the limit of detection in 6 out of 9 samples. A literature review on the design and reporting of studies on the transfer of PBDEs from mother to infant revealed a lack of transparency in many cases. The use of the recently published STROBE-ME guidelines is therefore recommended.
18411489	In this study, we recruited 49 subjects from one village close to an electronic waste (e-waste) site (exposed group) and another located 50 km away from the e-waste site (control group). We found that serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (median PBDEs, 382 ng/g lipid weight; range, 77-8452 ng/g lipid weight) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (median TSH, 1.79 microIU/mL; range, 0.38-9.03 microIU/mL) and frequencies of micro-nucleated binucleated cells (MNed BNC; median, 5% per hundred; range, 0-96% per hundred) were significantly higher in the exposed group than in the control group (158 ng/g, range of 18-436 ng/g, and p < 0.05; 1.15 microIU/mL, range of 0.48-2.09, and p < 0.01; and 0% per hundred, range of 0-5% per hundred, and p < 0.01, respectively). A history of working with e-waste was significantly associated with increased MNed BNC frequencies (odds ratio (OR), 38.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1-1358.71, p = 0.044), independent of years of local residence, a perceived risk factor. However, there was no association between PBDEs exposure and oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, the exposure to PBDEs at the e-waste site may have an effect on the levels of TSH and genetoxic damage among these workers, but this needs to be validated in large studies.
15556543	The separation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners was evaluated on four capillary columns: 60 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness RTX-5MS and DB-XLB capillary columns, and 60 m x 0.18 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness DB-XLB and DB-5MS capillary columns. Based on performance, capacity, and cost, the RTX-5MS (60 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm thickness) and the DB-XLB (60 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness) were selected for the analysis of human serum extracts by using gas chromatography/electron-capture detection. In contrast to previous studies, the oven temperature program affords the separation of congeners that are not separated by using other combinations of capillary columns, most notably PBDE-47 and PCB 180. In addition, the method enables determination of OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs prevalent in a single extract of serum, which can lead to considerable time savings in the analysis of large number of samples collected for epidemiologic studies.
20609475	As part of a larger exposure study, samples of dust and indoor air were collected in the homes of 43 pregnant women living in the Copenhagen area (Denmark) and analysed for 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers using GC-MS. A second dust sample collected after delivery was analysed for BDE-183 and BDE-209, which were highly correlated with the pre-delivery samples, but did not reproduce the actual values. Concentrations as high as 80 μg/g were measured for the dominant BDE congener BDE-209, with median concentrations of 332 and 432 ng/g, respectively, in pre- and post-delivery dust samples. In 12% of the dust samples, the concentration of BDE-209 was lower than that of the summed concentration of PentaBDE congeners. The median concentrations of BDE-47 and BDE-99 in dust were 16.9 and 13.6 ng/g, respectively. The dust concentrations were in line with other European studies and confirmed previously established geographical differences between continental Europe and North America. Additional octa- and nonaBDE congeners (BDE-197, BDE-203, BDE-206, BDE-207, and BDE-208) were analysed in dust and analytical issues were discussed as these congeners also can be a product of thermal degradation of BDE-209 in gas chromatographic analysis. BDE-206 was the dominating nonaBDE, with median and maximum concentrations of 12.8 and 2217 ng/g, respectively, but the ratio of nonaBDEs to the sum of nona- and decaBDEs was relatively constant, despite a large range in absolute dust concentrations. While the congeners of the PentaBDE mixture were highly inter-correlated for both dust and air, no correlation was found with BDE-209 in either matrix. Air concentrations were relatively high in an international context, with median concentrations of 134, 63.7 and 119 pg/m³ for BDE-47, BDE-99 and BDE-209, respectively, and not correlated with dust concentrations. Additional placenta data were available for the study group and found to correlate significantly with dust concentrations for some PentaBDE congeners, but not BDE-209, indicating that dust may be an important exposure pathway for PentaBDE congeners. While BDE-209 also was present in placenta, it did not exceed the other congeners by the same factors as in dust. This might be caused by a combination of the compound's physical-chemical properties affecting bioavailability, uptake, partitioning and metabolisation, and other sources of exposure, but was not investigated further in this study. For all matrices, the PBDE profile resembled that of the technical product Bromkal 70-5DE, but air contained higher percentages of the lower brominated congeners and placenta tissue was dominated by BDE-153. The predominance of BDE-153 has been described in other studies on human samples and related to the highest retention in the body, but further research into toxicokinetics will be required to clarify mechanisms.
12842779	The aim of this study was to determine human prenatal and postnatal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (polychlorobiphenylols; OH-PCBs), and pentachlorophenol (PCP). The median PBDE fresh-weight concentrations in maternal and cord blood plasma and in breast milk were 24, 4.3, and 75 pg/g, respectively. The PCB concentrations were approximately 60 times higher in each compartment (1,560, 277, and 4,310 pg/g, respectively). Calculated on a lipid weight basis, the levels were comparable in maternal blood plasma and breast milk. In contrast to PCBs, differences were found between PBDE congener distribution in maternal and cord blood plasma. The OH-PCBs constituted up to 26% of the PCB levels in maternal blood plasma and 53% in cord blood plasma, with levels of 120 and 88 pg/g fresh weight, respectively, and in breast milk 3 pg/g. The corresponding concentrations for PCP were 2,830, 1,960, and 20 pg/g. The ratios of PCB to OH-PCB were 13, 3, and 1,400 in maternal, cord plasma, and breast milk, respectively. It is evident that prenatal exposures occur for all the analytes. Moreover, the exposure continues after birth via breast milk. However, levels of OH-PCBs and PCP in breast milk are low compared with levels in blood plasma. Exposures to both PCBs and PBDEs, and in particular to the endocrine-active halogenated phenolic compounds, are of concern and implicate a potential risk for developmental disturbances.
14740711	Methoxylated and hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs and OH-PBDEs) have recently been reported to be present in wildlife from Northern Europe. The structures of a majority of these compounds have however been unknown. In the present study, nine OH-PBDEs and six MeO-PBDEs were identified in Baltic Sea salmon (Salmo salar) blood. All OH- and MeO-PBDEs identified were substituted with four or five bromines, and five of these had one chlorine substituent. Fourteen of the OH- and MeO-PBDEs have the methoxy or hydroxy group substituted in the ortho position to the diphenyl ether bond. Identification was done by comparison of relative retention times of authentic reference standards with compounds present in salmon plasma on two gas chromatographic columns of different polarities. The identification was supported by comparisons of full-scan mass spectrometric data: electron ionization (EI) and electron capture negative ionization (ECNI). Nine of the 15 OH- and MeO-PBDEs identified have not previously been reported to occur in the environment. The structures of several identified OH- and MeO-PBDEs support natural origin. However, at least one of the OH-PBDEs may be a hydroxylated metabolite of anthropogenic polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE).
18804904	In the frame of a French monitoring program, tri- to deca- polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE) have been measured in maternal and cord serum, adipose tissue, and breast milk samples, collected from 93 volunteer women during caesarean deliveries. The seven major tri- to heptaBDE (BDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183) were detected in adipose tissue and breast milk with cumulated median values of 2.59 and 2.51 ng g(-1) l w. Nine highly brominated octa- to decaBDE (BDE-196, 197, 201, 202, 203, 206, 207, 208 and 209) was performed in the same samples, with cumulated median values of 2.73 and 3.39 ng g(-1) l w in adipose tissue and breast milk, respectively. At this opposite, median levels of octa- to decaBDE in maternal and cord serum appeared significantly higher than the levels of tri- to heptaBDE in the same matrices, i.e. 8.85 and 12.34 versus 0.98 and 0.69 ng g(-1) l w, respectively.
1965165	A field biochemical epidemiology study was conducted using the Michigan cohort consisting of 51 rural residents exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB). The study had three major objectives: a) to determine the serum half-life of the major PBB congener, hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), in the human, b) to determine if the PBB-exposed subjects had elevated cytochrome P-450I function as determined by the caffeine breath test (CBT) and the caffeine urinary metabolite ratio (CMR), and c) to determine the applicability of the CBT and CMR in field studies. PBB serum levels were detected in 36 of the 51 PBB-exposed subjects. The serum half-life of HBB was determined by comparing the current serum HBB values to the subject's previous serum values obtained 5 to 8 years earlier. The median HBB half-life was 12 years (range 4-97 years). The CBT and CMR were elevated in the subjects exposed to PBBs as compared to the values obtained from urban nonsmokers and were similar to those found in adults who smoke. A gender effect was seen in the PBB-exposed subjects, the median CBT and CMR values of the females being lower than the values of males. There was a correlation between the CBT and the HBB serum values (r2 = 0.2, p = 0.01) but not between CMR and HBB serum values. The CBT and CMR were easily conducted in the field and appear to be useful metabolic probes of cytochrome P-450I activity in human environmental toxicology.
18554980	This paper reviews the existing literature on human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), with particular focus on external exposure routes (e.g. dust, diet, and air) and the resulting internal exposure to PBDEs (e.g. breast milk and blood). Being lipophilic and persistent organic compounds, PBDEs accumulate in lipid-rich tissues. Consequently, food items like fish from high trophic levels or lipid-rich oils have been found to contain relatively high concentrations of PBDEs, thus presenting an important exposure pathway to humans. The presence of PBDEs in various products of everyday use may lead to some additional exposure in the home environment. Dust seem to be an aggregate of the indoor source, and the ingestion of dust conveys the highest intake of BDE-209 of all sources, possibly also of other PBDE congeners. The PBDE exposure through dust is significant for toddlers who ingest more dust than adults. Infants are also exposed to PBDEs via breast milk. Internal human exposure has generally been found to be one order of magnitude larger in North America than in Europe and Asia. These differences cannot solely be explained by the dietary intake as meat products are the only food group where some differences has been observed. However, indoor air and dust concentrations have been found to be approximately one order of magnitude higher in North America than in Europe, possibly a result of different fire safety standards. Within Europe, higher PBDE concentrations in dust were found in the UK than in continental Europe. Recent studies have shown that BDE-209 also accumulates in humans. A shift in congener composition from maternal to umbilical cord blood has been observed in several cases. A shift has also been observed for BDE-209, which is present in larger ratios in umbilical cord blood and in particular in placenta than in maternal blood.
22277921	This study aimed at revealing the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in breast milk from primipara in Shenzhen (China), and estimating daily intake of PBDEs for breast-fed infants. Concentrations of 7 PBDEs were measured in 60 breast milk samples by isotope dilution HRGC/HRMS (high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry). The intake of PBDEs for breast-fed infants was estimated based on the infant's daily milk consumption. The range of total concentration of 7 PBDEs congeners in samples was 2.6-188.6 ng g(-1) lipid (mean: 14.8 ng g(-1) lipid; median: 7.2 ng g(-1) lipid). The mean estimated daily intake of PBDEs by breast-fed infants ranged from 9.9 to 335.9 ng kg(-1) body weight (bw) per day (mean: 52.5 ng kg(-1) bw per day; median: 28.6 ng kg(-1) bw per day). The levels of PBDEs body burden in the recruited mothers of Shenzhen were higher than those reported previously for the general population from other areas in China. No significant correlations were found between the body burden of PBDEs and the mothers' age, pre-pregnancy BMI, dietary habits, duration of residence in Shenzhen, weight and length of the newborns. BDE-47 and BDE-153 were major PBDE congeners in milk samples, while the congeners of BDE-183 and BDE-28 were also high in Shenzhen. The situation may be attributed to the special economic pattern including electronic production in Shenzhen in the past three decades. Continuous surveillance on PBDEs levels in human milk is needed in order to accurately evaluate the environmental impact of PBDEs to human health in Shenzhen.
19075460	The drift in sensitivity due to carbon deposition on the sampling cone, skimmer cone and ion lenses has been a serious problem in gas chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC/ICP-MS). To overcome this problem, a high-speed switching method between a mixed-gas plasma and a pure-argon plasma (named plasma gas-switching method) using an oxygen permeation tube and a switching valve was developed. This enabled both the cleaning of deposited carbon and an enhancement of the sensitivity; as a consequence, both the repeatability and the sensitivity of polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) were improved by more than 3 and 4 times, respectively. The drifts of sensitivity over a period of 8 h were less than 5% in most cases. Concerning the analytical performance of thermally labile congeners from octa- to deca-BDE, the detection limits, dynamic ranges of the calibration graphs and unequivalent sensitivities were remarkably improved by using a metal capillary separation column coated with a very thin (0.05 micromm) film of immobilized-polydimethylsiloxane. The detection limits ranged from 0.014 pg (BDE-154) to 0.093 pg (BDE-209), which were equal or superior to the lowest values reported hitherto by GC/MS (high resolution). A remarkable loss of sensitivity for highly-brominated congeners, such as nona- and deca-BDE, was observed in an analysis of PBDE technical mixtures when the solvent was methanol. The loss of sensitivity turned out to be due to an activation of the retention gap used for on-column injection; this problem was solved by changing methanol to isooctane in the sample-preparation step before analysis.
20056561	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardant compounds that are persistent and bioaccumulative and therefore have become ubiquitous environment contaminants. Animal studies suggest that prenatal PBDE exposure may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects. OBJECTIVE: In a longitudinal cohort initiated after 11 September 2001, including 329 mothers who delivered in one of three hospitals in lower Manhattan, New York, we examined prenatal PBDE exposure and neurodevelopment when their children were 12-48 and 72 months of age. METHODS: We analyzed 210 cord blood specimens for selected PBDE congeners and assessed neurodevelopmental effects in the children at 12-48 and 72 months of age; 118, 117, 114, 104, and 96 children with available cord PBDE measurements were assessed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 months, respectively. We used multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the associations between concentrations of individual PBDE congeners and neurodevelopmental indices. RESULTS: Median cord blood concentrations of PBDE congeners 47, 99, and 100 were 11.2, 3.2, and 1.4 ng/g lipid, respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders, children with higher concentrations of BDEs 47, 99, or 100 scored lower on tests of mental and physical development at 12-48 and 72 months. Associations were significant for 12-month Psychomotor Development Index (BDE-47), 24-month Mental Development Index (MDI) (BDE-47, 99, and 100), 36-month MDI (BDE-100), 48-month full-scale and verbal IQ (BDE-47, 99, and 100) and performance IQ (BDE-100), and 72-month performance IQ (BDE-100). CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiologic study demonstrates neurodevelopmental effects in relation to cord blood PBDE concentrations. Confirmation is needed in other longitudinal studies. 
21124237	OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in US professional airline workers. METHODS: We recruited 30 healthy US professional airline workers who lived in the Dallas, Texas, area to test their blood PBDE levels. We examined the relationship between hours worked in an airplane and total PBDE blood levels. RESULTS: Total PBDE blood levels from the 30 volunteers were unremarkable despite minor elevations of certain congeners in a few volunteers. No statistically significant correlations were noted between hours in airplanes in the past 1 or 5 years and levels of individual brominated diphenyl ethers congeners or total PBDEs. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized that elevated PBDE levels in commercial aviation workers could be found associated with time spent in airliners. Our findings do not support such an association. 
19750114	BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used as flame retardants in many products and have been detected in human samples worldwide. Limited data show that concentrations are elevated in young children. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between PBDEs and age with an emphasis on young children from Australia in 2006-2007. METHODS: We collected human blood serum samples (n = 2,420), which we stratified by age and sex and pooled for analysis of PBDEs. RESULTS: The sum of BDE-47, -99, -100, and -153 concentrations ( summation operator(4)PBDE) increased from 0-0.5 years (mean +/- SD, 14 +/- 3.4 ng/g lipid) to peak at 2.6-3 years (51 +/- 36 ng/g lipid; p < 0.001) and then decreased until 31-45 years (9.9 +/- 1.6 ng/g lipid). We observed no further significant decrease among ages 31-45, 45-60 (p = 0.964), or > 60 years (p = 0.894). The mean summation operator(4)PBDE concentration in cord blood (24 +/- 14 ng/g lipid) did not differ significantly from that in adult serum at ages 15-30 (p = 0.198) or 31-45 years (p = 0.140). We found no temporal trend when we compared the present results with Australian PBDE data from 2002-2005. PBDE concentrations were higher in males than in females; however, this difference reached statistical significance only for BDE-153 (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed peak concentration at 2.6-3 years of age is later than the period when breast-feeding is typically ceased. This suggests that in addition to the exposure via human milk, young children have higher exposure to these chemicals and/or a lower capacity to eliminate them. 
21739933	This study aimed at the generation of preliminary results allowing for the assessment of breastfed infants exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) which constitute important contaminants in places of human habitation. The second goal was to compare the concentrations of these compounds with other contaminants which people are exposed to via food chain. 28 breast milk samples from women living in Warsaw and neighbourhood were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153), polychlorinated biphenyls (CB-77, CB-101, CB-118, CB-126, CB- 138, CB-153, CB170, CB-180) and organochlorine pesticides (HCB, β-HCH, γ-HCH, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDT). The ΣDDT levels noted in our studies were higher than in other European countries. The concentrations of the examined polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers did not diverge from the levels presented by other authors and are comparable to the levels noted in other countries in Europe.
